1,1978,"Hygienic sanitary conditions of sun dried meat marketed in Cruz das Almas, Bahia and detection of strains with antimicrobial resistance","This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological, physical and chemical qualities of sun dried meat marketed in Cruz das Almas, Bahia, as well as trace the resistance profile of the isolated strains against different commercial pharmacos. There were collected and analysed 36 samples of sun dried meat, acquired in 12 different establishment (supermarkets, mini-markets, butchers and a municipal market), and quantified mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, E. coli and presence of Salmonella spp., as well as specific content humidity, water activity (Aw) and chloride. In 83% of the establishments, mesophilic bacteria counted > 105 CFU.g-1 and 58% coliforms at 35º C > 105 NMP.g- 1 and coliforms at 45ºC > 103 NMP.g-1. Escherichia coli was isolated in 75% of the establishments. Staphylococcus spp. ranged from 4.8 x 104 to 9.0 x 108 UFC.g-1, not being isolated Staphylococcus coagulase positive. Salmonella was found in 25% of the establishments. The humidity in the sun dried meat samples ranged from 52.37% to 74.69%, the Aw from 0.87 to 0.95 and the chloride from 3.16% to 5.98%. Salmonella was 100% resistant to tetracycline, acid nalidixic, cephalothin and erythromycin, with intermediate resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin. Escherichia coli was resistant to erythromycin (100%), ampicillin (68.7%), cephalothin (71.4%), tetracycline (64.2%), nalidixic acid (35.7%) and gentamicin (12.5%). Multiresistant strains of E. coli were observed in 87.5% of the isolates, and it happened that in 28.6% of the resistance it was mediated by plasmids. Multidrug resistance profile was observed in all Salmonella, with a strain showing plasmid resistance. The marketing of sun dried meat in Cruz das Almas presents hygienic and sanitary failures due to it’s high microbial loads. This fact undermines the safety and product lifetime, and may also pose risk to public health since it markets strains with antimicrobial.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/14389/14601,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Características fitotécnicas do feijoeiro sob doses de nitrogênio em semeadura e cobertura na safra das águas no Norte de Minas Gerais,"Apesar da elevada demanda de nitrogênio pela cultura do feijoeiro, no Brasil são relatados poucos estudos voltados para o manejo adequado de doses de N em semeadura e cobertura no aumento do rendimento de grãos do feijoeiro comum para a região semiárida. O presente estudo objetivou avaliar as características fitotécnicas do feijoeiro após a adição de doses de nitrogênio em semeadura e cobertura na safra das águas. Foi utilizado o esquema fatorial 4x4, correspondente a quatro doses de N na semeadura (0, 40, 80, 120 kg ha-1) e quatro doses de N em cobertura (0, 40, 80, 120 kg ha-1). O delineamento experimental utilizado foi de blocos casualizados, com três repetições. O estudo foi conduzido em Latossolo Vermelho eutrófico sob preparo convencional do solo. A cultivar Pérola foi semeada em parcelas compostas por 6 linhas com 5 m de comprimento, e espaçadas por 0,5 m entre linhas, destas, foram aproveitadas as quatro fileiras centrais, totalizando 10 m2 de área útil. Foram avaliados: estande final, número de vagens por planta, número de grãos por vagem, massa de 100 grãos e produtividade. As doses de N em semeadura proporcionaram incrementos no número de vagens por planta, e a adubação em cobertura, com 83,33 kg ha-1 de N, produziu a maior massa de 100 grãos. A produtividade máxima (MET-3.092 kg ha-1) foi observada com 62,4 kg ha-1 de N em semeadura mais 61,9 kg ha-1 de N em cobertura, e a máxima eficiência econômica (MEE) com 60,3 kg ha-1 de N em semeadura mais 59,5 kg ha-1 de N em cobertura, indicando a necessidade de parcelamento da adubação nitrogenada no período das águas para o feijoeiro comum cultivado no Norte do Estado Minas Gerais.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/13652/13654,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Influence of silicon on production and fruit quality of strawberry,"In Brazil, the culture of strawberries is an important activity for small and medium farmers. Among the important factors for culture is fertilization, which can interfere in production and fruit quality. Silicon (Si) is one of the little studied in fertilization, which demonstrated some beneficial to several different cultures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of Si on production and concentration of anthocyanin and titratable acid in the fruit and reading SPAD (chlorophyll) in the leaves of the strawberry. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using pots containing 14.5 kg of limed soil, fertilized and three plants (cultivar Milsei Tudla) were transplanted to pots. Treatments consisted of application of Si at 0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 rates, via soil or foliar. During this experiment the reading of SPAD (chlorophyll) and the end of the experiment, the shoots was collected, dried, weighed, ground and analyzed by content and accumulation Si. The fruits were weighed and analyzed the concentration of anthocyanin, titratable acidity and Si concentration. The fertilization with Si, via soil or foliar applied, contributed to the increase in fruit production, especially with the application via soil. Applying foliar or soil promoted an increase in the values of titratable acidity and anthocyanins. Rates of Si via soil or foliar applied influenced the reading SPAD (chlorophyll), in the leaves. The Si independent of the form of application promoted improvements in strawberry crop.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/12729/13636,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The production is relatively independent on climatic conditions, faster obtaining of the finished product and need small space. Biopolymers have been studied thoroughly in the last years. Due to wide diversity in structure and physical properties, the microbial polysaccharides possess a lot of applications in food, pharmaceutical, oil, cosmetics, textile, inks and agricultural products among others industries. Some of those applications, include uses as emulsifying, stabilizing, binding, jellifying, clotting, lubricants, film coated, thickening and suspender agents. The parameters that have most influenced the process of exopolysaccharides biosyntheses have been the microorganism, the culture medium composition, pH and temperature of incubation. The exopolysaccharide production can be developed by species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, some microalgae and many moulds.

1,1978,Amylase and protease inhibition activity against Fusarium verticillioides Amylase and protease inhibition activity against Fusarium verticillioides,"The primary maize pathogen, Fusarium verticillioides (F. moniliforme Sheldon) is responsible for fumonisin production, which is harmful to human and animal health. In addition, maize can be more susceptible to fungal infection after insect attack. The activity of amylase and protease inhibitors in AG 5011 and CD 307 hybrids were determined during germination with controlled and not controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity and, they were correlated to maize resistance against Sithophilus zeamais. The inhibitory activity during corn germination was evaluated at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 h. Amylase and protease inhibitory activity increased during germination in both hybrids, which ranged respectively from 2.8 to 39.5 UIA/g, and 550.0 to 3633.9 UIP/g. The highest levels of inhibitory activity occurred in hybrid CD 307 in germination chamber. The biologic cycle and susceptible rate were evaluated for corn resistance test. The AG 5011 hybrid was less susceptible to S. zeamais and showed higher inhibitory activity (time 0 h), demonstrating possible relationship between resistance against the insect and inhibitory enzymes. These results indicated that maize natural defense mechanism plays an important role on phytopathogen control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2425/2072,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was randomized blocks in a 4 x 4 factorial scheme involving four plant populations (100, 200, 300 and 400 thousand plants ha-1) and four rates of fertilization and liming (0.0; 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 of the recommended doses) with four replicates. Plant height, grain yield, pod number per plant, grain number per pod and 100 grain-weight were determined. It follows that both, fertilization plus liming and high plant population resulted into higher yields. The maximum economical efficiency was obtained from fertilizer and limestone amounts equivalents to those of the refference dose.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2205/1894,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Zinc sources applied in seeds of sorghum 310 cv. BR and the initial growth,"The zinc application in sorghum seeds can affect the nutrition and the initial growth of the plants. Thus, the objective of their study was to evaluate the zinc application in the form of sulphate and oxide on the nutrition and on the initial growth of the plant of sorghum cv. BRS 310. The treatments had been five rates 0; 14,3; 28,6; 57,2 and 114,4 g Zn kg-1 of seeds and two zinc sources, the sulphate (22% of Zn) and the oxide (50% of Zn). The experimental units were translucent polyethylene trays a filled with 5 L of washed thick sand, with 50 seeds of sorghum cv. BRS 310. The plants were cut 25 days after the sowing, and were evaluated for dry matter of above ground parts and the roots and it was determined the content and the accumulation of Zn in the plants. The zinc application in the oxide form promoted greater increment of dry matter in sorghum plants and provided to greater efficiency of use of the micronutrient, even so, with lesser efficiency of absorption, when compared the source sulphate. The source sulphate caused reduction in the production of the mass of the dry matter of sorghum. The sources had promoted alteration in the absorption of other nutrients for the sorghum plants, being that the source sulphate developed the absorption of P, Ca, S and Mn and the source oxide bigger absorption of K, Mg, Cu and Fe.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2958/2505,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Bovine brucellosis: epidemiological situation in Brazil and disease control initiatives,"Bovine brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is present throughout Brazil, whose prevalence distribution shows variations among states and within the productive areas of the states, causing serious losses to cattle production and public health due to risk of transmission to humans. Therefore, since 2001, the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT) is being implemented in all Federative Units of Brazil, based on the compulsory vaccination of bovine females, control of animal movement and certification of brucellosis-free herds. This review covers the current epidemiological situation of bovine brucellosis in Brazil, issues related to public health and economic importance, as well as Brazilian initiatives to control the disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22612/19477,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Broken rice in feeds for laying Japanese quails,"This study evaluated the effect, on productive performance and on egg quality, of replacing corn with broken rice in the feed of 64-148 day-old Japanese quails. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with five treatments consisting of five inclusion levels of broken rice (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) with eight replicates of eight birds each. No significant differences were observed in productive performance variables across treatments (P > 0.05, all). Regarding egg quality, no significant differences were observed in yolk percentage, specific gravity, or Haugh unit across treatments (P > 0.05 for all parameters). However, yolk color index was negatively affected by dietary rice husk levels (Y = 4.080 - 0.0293X, R² = 98.56%; P < 0.05). Thus, corn can be replaced with up to 100% broken rice in diets for laying Japanese quails without losses in productive performance or egg quality, but corn replacement with broken rice affects yolk color.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22482/19711,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Bovine and human brucellosis in the Trans-Amazonian agricultural frontier, Uruará, Pará, Brazil","We evaluated the prevalence of brucellosis in cattle and humans on properties characterized as family farms in the municipality of Uruará, state of Pará, located on the border of the Trans-Amazon Highway, in a serological study. We randomly sampled cattle and humans from 67 family farms. Cattle sera were tested with buffered acidified antigen and human samples were tested using the slow tube agglutination test (titration of 80 as a cutoff point). The prevalence of bovine brucellosis was 52% [90% CI: 42; 63]. The prevalence of households with at least one brucellosis positive individual was 21% [13; 31]. In households with at least one positive test, 23% of subjects were positive (range 8% and 50%). Five percent (21/422) of all human samples tested were positive. This high exposure rate in humans is a result of high cattle infection rates. We expect that in regions of Brazilian with a high prevalence of bovine brucellosis, there is also a high rate human exposure; however, few human cases have been reported. This is likely because of the largely non-specific symptoms of human Brucella abortus infections. Hopefully this study will bring about new information to public and animal health authorities involved in formulating policies aimed at decreasing disease prevalence.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27209/19946,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nonunion fractures in small animals - A literature review,"Bone nonunion is observed when the healing of a fracture fails and all processes of biologic repair cease. It is a frequent complication during fracture treatment in small animals. Nonunions are classified as viable or nonviable, and most cases result from technical error (e.g., inadequate or inappropriate choice of the type of stabilization), poor vascularization, excessive distance between the fragments, infection, and systemic disease, or local as well as idiopathic factors. The diagnosis is made when there is no radiographic evidence of bone healing. This condition cannot be treated conservatively; rather, nonunions require surgical intervention involving removal of implants (besides exuberant callus removal), proper alignment, and compression of the fracture site. As bone nonunion remains a common problem in clinical practice, the objective of this paper is to review the pathophysiology and methods for treating of the condition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22510/19777,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Use of a locking plate “notched head T-plate®” for the fixation of an ilial body fracture in a dog,"Several types of implants may be used to treat iliac fractures in dogs, of which osteosynthesis with plate is the most described and recommended in the literature. The type of plate and screw are major factors in osteosynthesis success. The use of locking plates has been advocated for this purpose, as they do not allow the plate-bone-screw unit to shift, providing angular stability and rigidity to the system. The present study aimed to describe the unprecedented use of a locking notched head T-plate in the treatment of a caudal body of ilium fracture. A two year old male mongrel dog was attended after falling from a third floor height, with two days of evolution. The animal was in standing position, and during orthopedic examination non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb, instability, and crepitus in the right body of ilium, with considerable swelling and pain. The radiographic examination allowed diagnosing a complete fracture of the caudal body of ilium with decrease of the pelvic canal diameter. The patient underwent surgery, and the fracture was stabilized with an LCP notched head T-plate.

1,1978,Action of exogenous oxytocin on stress modulation in crossbred Red Angus cows,"Cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) are organised on the basis of leadership and dominance in such a manner that a disturbance by an external stressor causes negative effects on their health, productivity, well-being, and behaviour. One of these effects is the excessive release of glucocorticoids, which results in increased alertness. We evaluated the action of exogenous oxytocin (OT) on serum cortisol levels in crossbred Red Angus heifers. Twelve Red Angus crossbred heifers were moved daily from the pasture to the corral in weeks 1 and 2 for adaptation to human contact and handling in the cattle crush. In weeks 3 and 4, they were divided into two groups of six (T1 and T2). The T1 group was administered 20 IU (2 mL) of OT via intramuscular injection and the T2 group was administered 2 mL of saline solution 0.85% (SS). In weeks 5 and 6, they were only contained in the cattle crush for evaluation. On days 01, 07, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42, blood samples were collected by jugular venepuncture in vacuum tubes without anticoagulants. Then, serum cortisol levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. In the period of adaptation, during weeks 1 and 2, serum cortisol levels decreased in both the groups, with higher levels in the SS group; the same result was obtained in weeks 5 and 6. During treatment, however, there was a significant difference between the two groups in week 4, with a reduction in cortisol levels in the OT group. This result suggests a modulator effect of OT on neuroendocrine response to stress.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23290/19774,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Oxidative stress in dogs,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), also known as free radicals, are generated during cellular respiration. Under normal conditions, the body has the ability to neutralize the effects of free radicals by using its antioxidant defenses. In the case of an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, free radical production exceeds the capacity of organic combustion, resulting in oxidative stress. Of all the cellular components compromised by the harmful effects of ROS, the cell membrane is the most severely affected owing to lipid peroxidation, which invariably leads to changes in the membrane structure and permeability. With lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, some by-products can be detected and measured in tissues, blood, and other bodily fluids. The measurement of biomarkers of oxidative stress is commonly used to quantify lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane in humans, a species in which ROS can be considered as a cause or consequence of oxidative stress-related diseases. In dogs, few studies have demonstrated this correlation. The present review aims to identify current literature knowledge relating to oxidative stress diseases and their detection in dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21723/19031,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Resumption of cyclic ovarian activity in postpartum ewes: a review,"The reproduction rate is considered a crucial factor that affects the ability of producers to meet the growing demand for ovines meat, and optimizing this factor will maximize the production rate and increase the efficiency of livestock. A reduction in the length of the postpartum anestrus period results in a shorter interval between lambing and conception and enables more lambs to be produced throughout the life of a ewe. This review discusses the current knowledge of several factors associated with the resumption of cyclic ovarian function in postpartum ewes and how the suckling management of ewes may affect this process. Factors that influence the resumption of cyclic ovarian activity include uterine involution, follicular development, occurrence of silent ovulation and short estrous cycles, breed, reproductive seasonality, nutrition and lactation. Controlled suckling and early weaning are management practices that may be used to obtain three lambings in a 24-month period. In the majority of the studies the interval between lambing and first estrus was reduced when a controlled suckling management strategy was used, therefore the controlled suckling appears to be the best alternative because it has produced good results and is easy to implement. Currently, however, this practice is still not widely used.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20956/18779,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Many therapies have been set to treat equine tendinitis; however, just few result in improved relapse rates, quality of extracellular matrix (ECM) and increased biomechanical resistance of the treated tissue. Due to advances in the regenerative medicine, promising results were initially obtained through the implantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from the bone marrow in the equine tendon injury. Since then, many studies have been using MSCs from different sources for therapeutic means in equine. The adipose tissue has appeared as feasible MSC source.

1,1978,Haemorrhagic myelomalacia in a cat with extradural T-cell lymphoma,"Myelomalacia is a term used to indicate the softening of the spinal cord, which results from ischaemic or haemorrhagic necrosis that can occur as a sequel to acute spinal cord injury. A 10-month-old, female, mixed breed domestic cat exhibiting neurological symptoms was referred for evaluation. Neurological examination revealed symptoms consistent with thoracolumbar syndrome. Initial radiographic examination detected no changes of the thoracolumbar spine. The cat received a palliative treatment of and prednisolone. The patient did not respond to the treatment and one month later presented with worsening of symptoms that progressed to non-ambulatory paraplegia. Radiographic examination was performed a second time and revealed a mass inside the spinal canal at the L1 and L3 vertebral levels. The animal died and was sent for post-mortem examination. The necropsy revealed a greyish-white epidural mass inside the spinal canal that was compressing the spinal cord at the L1 and L3 vertebral levels. The spinal cord between T2 and L3 was reddish and friable. The pancreaticoduodenal lymph node was enlarged. Histologically, the spinal cord mass and pancreaticoduodenal lymph node presented neoplastic lymphocyte proliferation, and haemorrhagic myelomalacia was observed in the spinal cord from T2 to L3. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the neoplastic lymphocytes were positive for CD3 antibody (T-cell lymphoma), and the lymphoid organs showed immunostaining for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV).

Data were collected monthly from two areas, divided in 16 quadrants each, for a 24 month period (2012-2013). In each quadrant, 138 plants were evaluated. The number of diseased plants was counted in twenty planting lines, and the spatial pattern of the disease was analyzed. The following spatial analysis techniques were used: common sequences of “runs”, “doublets” and quadrants. We also determined the levels of disease aggregation in the sectors. Plants with FY had a spatial distribution aggregated in a lower line number when using the “run” analysis than when using the “doublets” method. Aggregation of FY cases was observed in 30% of the evaluated lines. The quadrant analysis confirmed the existence of case aggregation, with vertical and horizontal distribution. The existence of disease forming foci suggests that FY probably has biotic origin. Additional studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21621/19813,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Ulcerative dermatitis caused by feline herpesvirus type 1 in a domestic cat,"A case of ulcerative dermatitis caused by feline herpesvirus type 1 (FeHV-1) in an adult male domestic shorthair cat is reported. The cat was rescued from the streets and presented with ulcerative lesions at the nasal planum and tongue in addition to a history of occasional sneezing. Thirty days after of the first clinical evaluation, the cat died as a result of acute myeloid leukemia. During necropsy, ulcerative lesions were found on the superior lip, the skin of the nasal planum, and at the periorbital region. Ulcerations were also noted on the tongue and hard palate. Histological examination revealed extensive epidermal necrosis, which involved the subjacent dermis and adnexal structures; the inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes. Amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were occasionally observed in intact epithelial cells. In the immunohistochemical evaluation, positive intracytoplasmic immunolabeling was detected in the sebaceous and follicular epithelial cells as well as in the bronchiolar epithelial cells. Samples of lymphoid tissue tested positive for the presence of feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus by immunohistochemistry. Pulmonary tissue fragments were immunolabeled for feline calicivirus. Samples obtained from a cutaneous lesion were subjected to virus isolation in a cellular culture, which revealed the cytopathic effects characteristic of herpesvirus.

1,1978,Genetic diversity of tambaqui broodstocks in stock enhancement programs,"Natural populations of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) have significantly decreased in recent decades especially due to human extraction activities. So that the environmental impact may be reduced, the restocking of fish and increase in fish production are enhanced. Genetic evaluations using molecular markers are essential for this purpose. Current study evaluates the genetic variability of two tambaqui broodstocks used in restocking programs. Sixty-five samples (33 samples from broodstock A and 32 samples from broodstock B) were collected. DNA was extracted from caudal fin samples, with the amplification of four microsatellite loci: Cm1A11 (EU685307) Cm1C8 (EU685308) Cm1F4 (EU685311) and Cm1H8 (EU685315). Fourteen alleles in the stock of broodstock A were produced, five alleles for Cm1A11 locus (230, 255, 260, 270 and 276 bp), three alleles Cm1C8 (239, 260, and 273 bp), two alleles Cm1F4 (211 and 245 bp), four alleles for Cm1H8 (275, 290, 320 and 331 bp) and two unique alleles were found for Cm1A11 loci (alleles 270 and 276 bp) and Cm1H8 (alleles 275 and 331 bp). In broodstock B, ten alleles were produced, the same alleles of the first stock except for alleles 270 and 276 bp in Cm1A11 locus and 275 and 331 bp in Cm1H8 locus. Broodstock A revealed low frequency alleles in Cm1A11 loci, Cm1C8, Cm1F4 and Cm1H8, whereas broodstock B had no locus with low allelic frequency. Loci Cm1A11, Cm1C8 and Cm1H8 exhibited significant deficit of heterozygotes in both broodstocks, revealing changes in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic diversity between stocks was 0.1120, whilst genetic similarity was 0.894, with FST rate = 0.05, and Nm = 3.93, indicating gene flow between the two broodstocks. Results show that broodstocks are genetically closely related, with no great genetic variability. Strategies such as a previous genetic analysis of breeding with its marking, use of a large Ne crossing between the most genetically divergent specimens, and the introduction of new genetic material to broodstocks may maximize genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding within the next generation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26300/21085,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Change in energy metabolism of in vitro produced embryos: an alternative to make them more cryoresistant?,"For the development of in vitro produced (IVP) as well as in vivo produced bovine embryos, it is extremely important that their energy metabolism works properly because the embryo must be able to metabolize energy substrates that are necessary for producing energy. Lipids play an important role in early embryonic development, acting as source of energy for oocytes and embryos. However, it is known that oocytes and embryos, mainly IVP, accumulate large amounts of lipids in the cytoplasm. Although they are extremely important in embryonic development, lipids have been associated with the reduced survival of bovine embryos following cryopreservation. There is evidence that at least four different categories of lipids affect embryo survival after cryopreservation, including triglycerides (TAG), free fatty acids, cholesterol and phospholipids. Thus, many studies are being conducted to improve the resistance of IVP embryos to the cryopreservation process by reducing the concentration or removing the source of serum from the medium or by reducing oocyte/embryo lipids using mechanical or chemical means. Regarding the use of delipidating agents that reduce the uptake and synthesis of fatty acids (FA) by cells, substances such as phenazine ethosulfate (PES), forskolin, L-carnitine and isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have been utilized. This review aims to address important issues related to embryonic energy metabolism, the importance of lipid metabolism and its relation to the cryopreservation of IVP bovine embryos by summarizing the latest research in this field.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26534/21400,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Status of persistent organic pesticide residues in water and food and their effects on environment and farmers: a comprehensive review in Nigeria,"Pesticide helps to enhance agricultural production, however, it significantly affect both socio and environmental entities of a country. In Nigeria, pesticide is widely used, thus its traces have been detected in water, soil and air. Several studies have already indicated that most of the environmental ecology (air, water, and soil) in Nigeria has been contaminated by persistent organic pesticides like organochlorine and organophosphate. Other reasons of high pesticide residues present in Nigeria environment is due to inappropriate dosage applied of pesticides that leaves behind excess. However, its residues are found above safety levels in the air, water, and soil across the nation. Based on previous analysis, it is indicated that 125,000-130,000 metric ton pesticides are being applied annually in Nigeria. Despite banned of some pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane- and -Hexachlorocyclohexane, they are still being used by farmers in their agricultural production. Many of the Class 1 (high extremely toxic) pesticides are still being used in developing countries like Nigeria. Hence, there is need to sensitize and educate the general public especially the end-users (farmers) particularly on management practices of pesticides. Considering these entire hazardous situations, in this article the history of pesticide used in Nigeria has been reviewed in detail. The article also discussed the effects of pesticide use in Nigerian waters, soil and on crops. The risk of residual pesticide on agricultural workers, pesticide residue risk preventive measures by the Federal Government of Nigeria, banned and restricted pesticides in Nigeria, Nigerian Government and its efforts to eliminate persistent organic pesticides in use are also reviewed in details.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26637/21399,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of nitrous oxide on cardiovascular parameters in pigs anesthetized with propofol and subjected to pressure-controlled ventilation,"This paper evaluated the effects of the ratio of nitrous oxide to oxygen (50% of each) on cardiovascular parameters in pigs anesthetized with propofol and maintained in ventilation with intermittent positive pressure. Sixteen Large White pigs, weighing between 15 and 20 kg, were divided into two groups of eight animals, and designated as follows: GPN (propofol/nitrous oxide) and GPA (propofol/compressed air). In order to allow endotracheal intubation, the animals received azaperone (2 mg kg-1, IM) followed, after 20 minutes, by intravenous propofol. After successful intubation, continuous infusion of propofol was initiated at a dose of 0.4 mg kg-1minute-1. From this point, the GPN group received N2O (diluted in 50% oxygen), while the GPA group received compressed air (diluted in 50% oxygen). Rocuronium was then administered by continuous intravenous infusion at 0.6 mg kg-1h-1. Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) was started and adjusted to 15 cmH2O, and the respiratory rate was set to reach capnometry readings between 35-45 mmHg. The measurement of parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, stroke index) begun 15 minutes after the administration of rocuronium, and was repeated in 15-minute intervals for 60 minutes. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test. The results showed that the 1:1 ratio combination of nitrous oxide to oxygen (50% each) did not alter the mentioned parameters in pigs anesthetized with propofol and maintained at pressure-controlled ventilation, indicating that it is a safe protocol for the cardiovascular system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23009/21396,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Control of Meloidogyne incognita in tomato plants with highly diluted solutions of Thuya occidentalis and their effects on plant growth and defense metabolism,"This work aimed to control the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita in tomato Solanum lycopersicum L plants with high-diluted solutions of Thuya occidentalis, and to study its effects on growth and plant defense responses. The in vivo experiment was carried out over two years (2013 and 2014) at a climatized greenhouse, whilst the in vitro experiment was carried out in the laboratory. Eight treatments were used (6, 12, 24, 50, 100, 200 and 400CH (Hahnemannian centesimal) of T. occidentalis, with water as control treatment). For the in vivo assay, in 2013 plants were inoculated with about 4850 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2), while in 2014 they were inoculated with 5050 eggs and J2. The treatments were applied once a week, as 0.1% aqueous solutions onto the plant shoots, for 50 and 40 days respectively. For the in vitro experiment, the nematodes were directly exposed to the same 0.1% treatments. The treatments did not show nematostatic or nematicide effects in the in vitro assay, and had no influence on the hatching of the eggs. For the in vivo assay in 2013, T. occidentalis 100CH decreased the number of J2 present in the roots, whilst the dynamization of 200CH stimulated root development and increased the weight of the fruits of the first cluster. In 2014, 100CH decreased numbers of J2 in the soil. Some dynamization increased the plant’s defense enzyme activity, such as peroxidase (24, 50, 200 and 400CH), polyphenoloxidase (200CH), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (24 and 50CH). In this study, T. occidentalis 100CH showed potential for the control of M. incognita, whilst 24 and 200CH influenced the growth of plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24546/21393,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,High-quality total RNA isolation from melon (Cucumis melo L.) fruits rich in polysaccharides,"Melon, a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, is the fourth most important fruit in the world market and, on a volume basis, is Brazil’s main fresh fruit export. Many molecular techniques used to understand the maturation of these fruits require high concentrations of highly purified RNA. However, melons are rich in polyphenolic compounds and polysaccharides, which interfere with RNA extraction. This study aimed to determine the most appropriate method for total RNA extraction from melon fruits. Six extraction buffers were tested: T1) guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform; T2) sodium azide/?-mercaptoethanol; T3) phenol/guanidine thiocyanate; T4) CTAB/PVP/?-mercaptoethanol; T5) SDS/sodium perchlorate/PVP/?-mercaptoethanol, and T6) sarkosyl/PVP/guanidine thiocyanate, using the AxyPrepTM Multisource Total RNA Miniprep Kit. The best method for extracting RNA from both mature and green fruit was based on the SDS/PVP/?-mercaptoethanol buffer, because it rapidly generated a high quality and quantity of material. In general, higher amounts of RNA were obtained from green than mature fruits, probably due to the lower concentration of polysaccharides and water. The purified material can be used as a template in molecular techniques, such as microarrays, RT-PCR, and in the construction of cDNA and RNA-seq data.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24726/21394,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Seed vigor and amount of soybean straw on seedling emergence and productive performance of wheat,"The use of high-quality seeds is essential to minimize the possible suppressive effect of straw on seedling emergence, contributing to stand establishment and high grain yield. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of seed vigor associated with soil cover with different amounts of soybean straw on seedling emergence and productive performance of wheat. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using two wheat cultivars (CD 150 and BRS Gralha Azul) under a completely randomized design in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme with four replications. Factors consisted of two seed vigor levels (high and low) and five amounts of soybean straw (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 t ha?1). The following assessments were performed: seedling emergence, dry mass of seedling shoot, number of tillers, plant height, yield components (number of spikes per plant, number of grains per spike, and mass of one thousand seeds), grain yield, and harvest index. The use of high vigor seeds favors the emergence and dry mass production of seedling shoot for both cultivars. The increased amount of soybean straw reduces seedling emergence in both cultivars. In the cultivars CD 150 and BRS Gralha Azul, the amounts of soybean straw of 2.45 and 5.40 t ha?1, respectively, result in a higher wheat grain yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24500/21443,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Characterization and typology of sheep and goat production systems in the State of Paraíba, a semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil","Breeding of goats and sheep is an important activity in northeast Brazil, contributing to economic and social development of this region. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize goat and sheep rearing and breeding in the central-western region of the State of Paraíba, northeast Brazil. The study area included Borborema and mesoregions of the backlands of the state, represented by 127 municipalities in an area of 38.293 km2, with density of goats and sheep at 12.9 and 8.27 head/km2, respectively. A total of 62 farms belonging to five municipalities of the Borborema mesoregion and four municipalities of the Sertão mesoregion were surveyed. Epidemiological surveys were conducted in the farms, and questionnaires sought information on the economic, productive, and social aspects of the farm owners and the farms. The results allowed the classification of goat and sheep production systems in the semi-arid Paraíba as a family system and of subsistence, for farmers’ own consumption and for local trade, with low technology use and herds with up to 100 animals. The farmers’ level of education was low, and the investments and technical assistance for the development of breeding activity in the region were insufficient and/or inadequate. Thus, it was essential to conduct an economic study on the farms to assess the actual economic and financial status of breeding activity and the subsequent returns. It is suggested that these aspects be taken into account when planning livestock development policies, especially in terms of finance and technical assistance, as well as in the implementation of strategies to control commonly occurring diseases in the region, aimed at combating agents, environmental control, and protection of susceptible livestock.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27346/21441,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Frequency of concentrate supplementation for grazing beef cattle,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of frequency of concentrate supplementation on the daytime feeding behavior (grazing, rumination, drinking, and idle times), production performance, and economic viability of grazing cattle in the rainy season. A total of 120 uncastrated Nellore animals with an average body weight (BW) of 382.5 ± 32.2 kg were allocated to palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) paddocks for the experiment. We evaluated supplements provided in the amount of 2.0 kg/animal, supplied three times weekly (3tw) or daily (7X). Animals supplemented 3X (5.46%) spent more time (%) drinking water than those supplemented 7X (3.72%). Grazing time and animal performance were not influenced by the frequency of supplementation. Average daily gain was 1.00 and 1.02 kg/animal for the groups under 3X and 7X, respectively. Expenditures on transportation and labor are lower (43%) when animals are supplemented 3X. Supplementation provided three times per week does not affect the grazing time or the performance of beef cattle in the rainy season, but rather implies an expressive reduction of expenditures on labor and distribution of supplements.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27134/21405,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Waste from the biscuit and noodle industries in Nile tilapia diets,"The objectives of this work were to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and gross energy (GE) of coconut biscuit residues (CBR), sweet biscuits (SBR) and noodles (NR) for Nile tilapia and evaluate the performance of fingerlings fed with diets containing the residues with the highest nutritional value. In the digestibility study, 72 juveniles (with an average weight of 70.5 ± 2.7 g) were organized in a completely randomized design with three treatments and three replications (12 fish per replication). ADC was determined using an indirect method in which 0.10% chromium oxide (Cr2O3) acted as an indicator. To evaluate performance, 225 fingerlings (with an average weight of 3.4 ± 0.5 g) were distributed across 15 tanks (150 L), creating a completely randomized design with five treatments and three replications. The test diets contained 0, 4, 8, 12 or 16% CBR. ADCDM, ADCCP and ADCGE for each of the different residues were, respectively: 85, 88 and 86% for CBR; 32, 51 and 46% for SBR; 24, 31 and 26% for NR. The inclusion of CBR significantly affected final weight of the fish, specific growth rate and protein retention rate, as well as the carcass composition values for dry matter, mineral matter, gross energy and ethereal extract. CBR presents better digestibility than the other tested residues and it can be used as a substitute for maize meal in quantities up to 11.62%, thus improving fish performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27265/21389,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nutritional value of tifton 85 bermudagrass at two cutting heights and different times of storage,"The goal of this study was to assess the dehydration curve and nutritional value of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at two cutting heights from ground level (4 and 8 cm) during 120 days of storage in a closed shed. The dehydration curve was determined using samples from the entire plant at eight different times. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and five replicates. The second step consisted of assessing the nutritional value of the stored Tifton 85 bermudagrass in randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and two treatments per plot: cutting height of four and eight centimeters from the ground, and five different times for the subplots, with five replicates. Dehydration of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at the two heights occurred in 48 hours, considered an ideal time for hay drying. The dry matter content responded quadratically to the time of storage of the two heights, only differing during baling and after 120 days of storage. Crude protein content had a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, with the smallest value after 30 days of storage (107.0 g kg-1) and the largest after 90 days (147.8 g kg-1) in the cutting height of eight centimeters. The ether extract exhibited a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, only differing after 90 days of storage. The neutral detergent fiber content had linear positive response according to the time of storage, with no difference between the cutting heights. For the neutral detergent fiber content in the two cutting heights, the quadratic regression model was the best fit to the data, differing between the heights after 30 and 60 days of storage. In vitro dry matter digestibility and in vitro cell wall digestibility values of the stored hay were lower than the values obtained at the time of cutting. Cutting performed at four centimeters from the ground was the most suitable for hay production due to higher dry matter production and nutritional value without difference between bailing treatments. Hay storage caused undesirable changes in the nutritional value, especially in fiber content and in vitro digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27039/21387,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Energy coefficients of plant foods for broiler chickens at different ages,"In order to determine the apparent metabolizable energy (AME), the AME corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn), the apparent coefficients of metabolization (ACM) of gross energy and the ACM corrected for nitrogen balance (ACMn), an experiment was conducted to evaluate five different plant foods (corn, soybean meal, deactivated full-fat soybean, wheat bran and soybean oil) for broilers at different ages (1-8, 11-18, 21-28, 31-38 and 41-48 days). The method of total excreta collection was used, divided into five metabolism assays. The birds were housed in metabolic cages in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and five replicates per treatment, totaling 25 experimental units. The AME and AMEn values increased with the age of the birds for most foods, except soybean meal. The smaller AMC and AMCn of gross energy were obtained for wheat bran. There was adjustment of the equation to the linear response plateau model for the ACM of corn, soybean meal and deactivated full-fat soybean. The wheat bran and soybean oil were adjusted to the linear regression model. The equations show that the digestibility of energy tends to increase with age, except for soybean meal, which had higher metabolization with younger birds. We conclude that the age of the birds influences the determination of the metabolizable energy of feed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27034/21386,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nutritional value of sugarcane varieties in relation to nitrogen fertilization for the pre-Amazon Region of Brazil,"This study evaluated the nutritional value of sugarcane varieties in relation to nitrogen fertilization. The varieties studied were RB 863129, RB 867515, and RB 92579, and nitrogen fertilizer was applied at doses of 0, 60, 80, 120, and 140 kg N ha-1. The experiment was divided into two stages: i) Year I - plant cane, when the yield and nutritional quality of the three sugarcane varieties were evaluated; ii) Years II and III, when and the effect of nitrogen fertilization on the nutritional quality of the first and second ratoon crops of the same varieties was evaluated. In plant cane the yield (t ha-1) and DM (dry matter) and CP (crude protein) contents were higher for the RB 863129 variety. There was no difference between the varieties regarding their NDF (neutral detergent fiber) and ADF (acid detergent fiber) contents and IVDMD (in vitro dry matter digestibility). In the first and second ratoon crops, there was a difference between the varieties and fertilizer doses for the evaluated parameters, with the exception of the DM content and IVDMD, which were influenced by the varieties, doses of N, and cutting years. The RB 92579 variety showed the best yield of the two ratoon crops (131 t ha-1 of stems) and the best nutritional parameters (26% ADF, 41% NDF, 2.4% CP, and 69.4% IVDMD). The sugarcane yield and its nutritional quality can be influenced by the cutting year and nitrogen fertilization management system and by the variety type.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26988/21440,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Spatial dynamics: a new “milk corridor” in Paraná state, Brazil","Brazil is the fourth largest milk producer in the world, and Paraná state is the third largest producer in the country. Milk production plays an important socioeconomic role in Paraná state, and since the 1990s, institutional and market changes have influenced Paraná’s milk production. Given this context, this study searches to analyze the spatial dynamics of dairy activity in Paraná state. Specifically, it seeks to identify areas of greater expansion and contraction in dairy activities, and discuss possible structural and socioeconomic consequences in those regions. Data concerning productive and economic variables of the 399 municipalities in Paraná state were used to generate an indicator of dairy activity through Common Factor Analysis. Cluster analysis allowed the formation of groups, according to municipalities’ importance in Paraná’s dairy activity. We conclude that since the 1990s, there has been displacement of dairy activity from the northern regions and toward the south. Dairy activity has started to occupy areas otherwise considered ""agriculturally empty"" and socioeconomically vulnerable. Those areas, along with traditional production regions, comprise a new ""milk corridor"" in Paraná. This may generate a set of socioeconomic benefits in the region. Important structural changes may occur along the dairy chain, and both public and private policies should be set to assure dairy chain competitiveness in Paraná state.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27021/21406,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Marandu palisade grass intercropped with densely spaced teak in silvopastoral system,"This study was conducted to evaluate two systems of production: integration between teak and forage (silvopastoral system) and forage only (monoculture). The forage species used was Marandu palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu). In January 2009, part of the pasture was desiccated and the teak (Tectona grandis) was implemented in a 3 × 4 m spacing arrangement, and at every five rows, a space between rows of 6 m was established, providing a population of 750 trees per hectare. Alongside the development of the trees, the Marandu palisade grass pasture was reestablished. In February 2015, the animals were removed from the experimental area and, in March, the pasture degradation, the density and the mass of tillers was assessed. The following variables were evaluated: sward height; forage mass, percentage of leaf blade, stem+sheath and senescent material; leaf blade:stem+sheath ratio; and live:dead material ratio. The experimental design was completely randomized, with 12 replicates. Treatments consisted of two systems (silvopastoral and monoculture). The total forage accumulation was higher in the monoculture system. The sward height and the percentage of stem+sheath were higher in the integrated system, while the percentage of leaf blade and the leaf blade:stem+sheath ratio were higher in the system exclusively with forage. In conclusion, Marandu palisade grass tolerates shading in a high density spacing silvopastoral system, but the degradation process is more intense compared to grass in monoculture, and the use of Marandu palisade grass in silvopastoral systems changes the forage mass and the structure of the produced forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26893/21383,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of purified glycerin in balanced diets of chicken broilers treated from 22 to 42 days of age1,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of including purified glycerin in the diets of broilers from 22 to 42 days of age. Eighty Cobb 500® lineage broilers were distributed in a completely randomized design (CRD) to one of four treatment groups (0, 2, 4 and 6% of purified glycerin inclusion in feed) and five replicates of four birds. The birds were evaluated for performance (weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion); carcass yield; special cuts yield (thigh, drumstick and breast); muscle colour (L* = lightness, a* = redness, b* = yellowness); and crude protein, ether extract and moisture content of the breast muscle. Inclusion of purified glycerin in the diet did not affect (p > 0.05) any of the growth performance indicators, which demonstrated the technical feasibility of including up to 6% glycerin in the diet. Similarly, there was no effect on carcass yield; special-cut yields; muscle colour (L* = lightness, a* = redness, b* = yellowness); or crude protein, ether extract and moisture content of breast muscle. The inclusion of purified glycerin at up to 6% in the diet proved to be feasible in broilers treated from 22 to 42 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26903/21384,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Water with different salinity levels for lactating goats,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of supplying water with varying salinity levels to dairy goats on nutrient intake, apparent nutrient digestibility, and milk yield. The experiment lasted 65 days and involved 24 crossbred goats with mean body weight of 38±4 kg, which were randomly allotted. It was set in a completely randomized design with four treatments consisting of 640, 3188, 5740 and 8326 mg L?1 total dissolved solids (TDS) in the drinking water. The results showed that water salinity levels had no effect on the intake of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, ether extract, total carbohydrates, non-fibrous carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, metabolizable energy, digestible energy, or apparent nutrient digestibility. Water intake was influenced by the salinity, increasing as the salt level was increased. Moreover, the varying salinity had no significant effect on milk yield. Drinking water containing up to 8326 mg L?1 TDS provided no interference with the intake and nutrient digestibility of lactating goats in the feedlot. However, increasing the water salinity affects animal intake without any changes in milk yield. Therefore, this type of water can be used for crossbred goats at 30 days in milk, for up to 65 days in the feedlot.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26863/21382,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fiber composition and degradability of cold season green forage and pre-dried silage harvested at pre-flowering,"This study aimed to evaluate the contents of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, as well as the rates of dry matter degradability in forage and pre-dried silage of different winter cereals harvested at pre-flowering. The experiment was conducted by the Animal Production Center (NUPRAN), Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, State University of Midwest (UNICENTRO). It is located in Guarapuava – PR, Brazil. The study was part of the Master's Degree in Crop Production. As experimental materials, we used black oat (Avena strigosa) cv. EMB 139 and cv. IAPAR 61; white oat (Avena sativa) cv. IPR and 126 hp. URS Taura; barley (Hordeum vulgare) cv. BRS Brau and cv. BRS Cauê; wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. BRS Umbu and cv. BRS Tarumã; rye (Secale cereale) cv. Temprano and cv. BRS Serrano; and triticale (X Triticosecale) cv. IPR and 111 hp. BRS Saturn. Dry matter degradability was measured by an in situ technique, arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications (animal), subdivided in subplots. Treatments were the plots and subplots digestion times. The incubation times were 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. To that end, we used two 24-month rumen fistulated steers with 350 kg average weight. A similarity was observed in the results of both forage and pre-dried silage degradability, displaying the same trends. Barley cv. BRS Brau had the highest hemicellulose content in its composition; however, IPR 111 triticale was showed the highest degradability potential, both for green forage and pre-dried silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26817/21380,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fatty acid profile and lambs’ meat quality fed with different levels of crude glycerin replacing corn,"This study aimed to evaluate the Texel lambs’ meat quality fed with increasing levels of crude glycerin (0, 7, 14, and 21% of dry matter) in the diet. Thirthy-two-two non-castrated male Texel lambs were used, with initial weight of 15.9 ± 4.1 kg, using a completely randomized design with four treatments and eight repetitions, per treatment. Upon reaching the average weight of 35 kg, the animals were slaughtered. The meat chemical composition was similar among treatments (P>0.05) and total lipids and crude protein presented averages of 3.47 and 20.05 g 100g -1, respectively. No changes in pH, marbling, color, and water loss under pressure were observed. The shear force did not change among treatments and the texture can be considered soft, with average values of 5.48 kgf. There was a linear (P0.05) were observed for the attributes flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptance among treatments. Fatty acids in higher proportions in the meat lamb were to C18:1n-9 (1298.90 mg 100g-1), C16:0 (709.07 mg 100g-1) and C18:0 (433.30 mg 100g-1), with percentages of 42.72, 23.07 and 14.35%, respectively. Significant difference according to the glycerin level in the diet was observed only for the margaric acid (C17:0) with an increasing linear effect, reaching 58.95 mg 100g-1 muscle to the group with 21% crude glycerin, corresponding to 1.77% of total fatty acids. The other fatty acids did not change, and provided a satisfactory result for conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), totaling about 6.1 mg 100 g-1 muscle, corresponding to 0.21% of total lipids. The use of glycerin in the diet for finishing lambs does not alter the characteristics of the meat, maintaining the product quality for consumption.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26824/21381,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro digestibility and nutritional characterization of distillers dried grains with solubles according to the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System,"We evaluated the fractions of protein and carbohydrates in distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn grain (CG), soybean meal (SM), and corn silage (CS), as well as the in vitro digestibility (IVD) of DDGS, CG, SM, CS, rations containing 0.0, 8.0, 16.0, and 24.0% DDGS, and in vitro fermentation parameters after 24 h of incubation. DDGS were obtained following microbial fermentation for ethanol production from a sugar and alcohol distillery located in the state of Mato Grosso - Brazil. The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) was used to determine the protein and carbohydrate fractions of experimental diets. For the in vitro nutrient digestion assay using the experimental foods and experimental diets, two sheep with an average body weight of 26 kg were used as inoculum donors. The in vitro digestibility of food and feed was assayed in three replicates. Fraction A of DDGS CP was 88, 71, and 37% lower in relation to fraction A of SM, CG, and CS, respectively. Fraction B2 of DDGS protein contained 21% CP, which represents 78.84% of DDGS protein in fraction B2, and is higher than the SM, which was 70.44%. The B3 fraction of CP, which is partly released during ruminal fermentation, was 18% lower for SM compared to DDGS, and is expressed in %CP. For carbohydrate fractionation, the DDGS presented 8.64% for the A + B1 fraction on a DM basis, which was 62, 86, and 74% lower compared to those obtained for SM, CG. and CS, respectively. The hemicellulose and cellulose contents of DDGS were higher than those of SM, as verified in fraction B2, with a value of 46.92%, expressed in DM. The in vitro digestibility coefficients (IVDC) of the DDGS nutrients did not differ (p > 0.05) in relation to those of the other experimental foods. The inclusion of DDGS in rations formulated for sheep did not change (p > 0.05) the IVDC of DM, OM, CP. NDF, or ADF, with mean values of 70.93, 70.64, 59.58, 52.83, and 43.40%, respectively. Therefore, DDGS comprise a protein-rich food containing more than 70% CP in fraction B2, with a large amount of carbohydrates bound to the cell wall. In addition, DDGS possess a similar digestibility coefficient to corn grain and soybean meal; however, up to 24% can be included in feed formulations for ruminants without changing the in vitro digestibility coefficient of nutrients.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26727/21379,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Regional composition of carcass and tissue composition of cuts from lambs slaughtered with different subcutaneous fat thicknesses,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) on the regional composition of the carcass, the tissue composition of cuts, and the leg muscularity index of Santa Inês lambs. This experiment involved 24 uncastrated male lambs at approximately 100 days of age and at an average live weight of 22.70 ± 3.75 kg that were kept in the feedlot, where they received a complete pelleted diet formulated to provide a daily gain of 0.30 kg. The animals were slaughtered as they reached the pre-defined SFT of 2.00, 3.00, and 4.00 mm, evaluated by ultrasonography. Lambs slaughtered with 4.00 mm SFT had a heavier shoulder (1.80 kg) and leg (2.99 kg), differing from those slaughtered with 2.00 mm. No significant differences were observed (P > 0.05) between the treatments for the percentages of muscle in the cuts, which averaged 48.38% for the neck, 58.71% for the shoulder, 43.87% for the ribs, 53.56% for the loin, and 64.52% for the leg. Lambs slaughtered with 4.00 and 3.00 mm SFT differed from those slaughtered with 2.00 mm SFT for the percentage of total fat in the shoulder, which averaged 20.10, 19.02, and 15.79%, respectively. The animals slaughtered with 2.00 mm of fat exhibited the highest percentage of bone in the loin (20.23%). Leg muscularity was lower (0.34) in those slaughtered with 2.00 mm of subcutaneous fat. Slaughtering Santa Inês lambs with different subcutaneous fat thicknesses yields different regional compositions of the carcass, tissue compositions of cuts, and leg muscularity indices. It is recommended to slaughter Santa Inês lambs when they reach a subcutaneous fat thickness of 3.00 mm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26675/21378,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of shed rooftype and babassu pie on the productive characteristics of meat quails,"We aimed to evaluate the effects of shed roof(SR) typeand the inclusion of babassu pie (BP) in rations on the productive characteristics ofmeat quailsfrom days 14 to 28 and days14 to 40. We studied 896 meatquails. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 4x4 factorial arrangement, using four types of shedroofs (fiber cement, ceramic, straw, and painted fiber cement) and four rations (with 0, 5, 10, and 15% inclusion of babassu pie). The performance variables evaluated from 14 to 28 and 14 to 40 days included food intake (FI, g/bird), mean weight gain (WG, g/bird), food conversion (FC, g/g), mean live weight on day 28 (MW28, g/bird), mean live weight on day 40 (MW40, g/bird), and energy efficiency (EF; g Mcal). After slautherthe birds on day 40, we measured the carcass weight (CW) and the carcass yield (CY, %), obtained for the breast (BY), legs (LGY), and wings (WINGY). We also obtained the relative weight of the heart (HRW), liver (LRW), gizzard (GRW), and intestine (IRW). To compare the economic efficiency between the experimental rations, we analyzed the cost of ration per kg of carcass (CC) and determined the gross margin (GM). Between day 14 and day 28, we found that the use of SR influenced the FI28, WG28, and the MW28 of the quails (p < 0.05). BP did not affect FI28 (p > 0.05), but it linearly improved WG28, FC28, MW28, and EF28. Between days 14 and 40, we found that SR influenced the WG40, FC40, MW40, and EF40 of the quails (p < 0.05) and that a BP increased the FI40, WG40, and MW40 in a quadratic manner. SR and BP did not affect the CW, BY, WINGY, LGY, HRW, LRW,or IRW. However, BP influenced MGRW, which increased linearly with the inclusion of BP. We concluded that a ceramic roof provides better environmental conditions than do other shed roofs. The inclusion of BP improved the performance characteristics, and it was technically feasible to include up to 15% BP in the rations of meat quails. Based on the current cost analysis, however, the inclusion of BP is economically unfeasible.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26667/21377,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of ovarian tissue storage in Morus nigra extract on the morphology and DNA fragmentation of ovine preantral follicles,"This study demonstrated the effect of Morus nigra leaf extract during ovine ovarian tissue transportation on the survival and apoptosis of preantral follicles in vitro. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the fingerprint chromatogram of the crude ethanolic extract. Four pairs of ovaries from four sheep were collected. The ovarian cortex was fragmented and one fragment was fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde and processed for histological and TUNEL analysis (fresh control). The other fragments were placed in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM – control medium) or M. nigra extract (0.025; 0.05 or 0.1 mg/mL) and stored (simulating transport) at 4ºC for 6, 12 or 24 h. Preserved fragments (6 h) were also destined to histological and TUNEL analysis. HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of antioxidant compounds (rutin, isoquercetin e kaempferitrin) in the extract. There was a decrease (P < 0.05) in the percentage of morphologically normal preantral follicles after preservation in all treatments compared to the fresh control. The percentage of normal preantral follicles after preservation in M. nigra at 0.05 mg/mL for 6 h was higher (P < 0.05) than in MEM or 0.025 mg/mL M. nigra and similar (P > 0.05) to 0.1 mg/mL of the extract. Apoptosis increased (P < 0.05) after conservation for 6 h in all treatments compared to the fresh control. Moreover, TUNEL positive cells decreased (P < 0.05) after preservation in 0.05 or 0.1 mg/mL M. nigra compared to MEM or 0.025 mg/mL M. nigra. In conclusion, 0.05 mg/mL M. nigra extract can be used as a preservation medium for ovine ovarian tissue at 4°C for up to 6 h.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27285/21375,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fruit agribusiness waste as an additive in elephant grass silage,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential use of fruticulture waste as an additive in elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) cultivar Napier silage at different densities, defining the effect of fermentative quality, microbiological characteristics and bromatological composition. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, comprising a control, banana waste (BW), mango waste (MW), and passion fruit waste (PFW) at three densities (400, 500 and 600 kg green matter [GM] m-3). The effect of ensiling density was greatest in the exclusively elephant grass silage, where a compaction of 600 kg GM m-3 contributed to improvements in fermentation and microbiological processes. The addition of banana waste to the elephant grass silage promoted improvements only in bromatological composition, raising the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) content and reducing fiber components (neutral detergent fiber [NDFap] and acid detergent fiber [ADFap] corrected for ash and protein), but the addition of banana waste did not favor the fermentative or microbiological processes. The addition of passion fruit and mango by-products promoted increased DM and favored the fermentative, microbiological, and bromatological silage processes, regardless of density.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26499/21376,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro action of Mimosa caesalpinifolia ketone extract on Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis,"This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic activity of Mimosa caesalpinifolia (sabiá) ketone extract, which is rich in condensed tannins (CT), on Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. The leaves and stems of M. caesalpinifolia were collected, dried in the shade, and ground to a dry powder from which ketone extracts were obtained for in vitro assays. The extracts were diluted in 5% acetone and PBS to concentrations in the range 0.25-2.80 mg mL-¹ and the inhibition of egg hatchability was assayed. Feces collected from goats naturally infected with H. contortus (55%) and T. colubriformis (45%) were macerated and the helminth eggs were collected to conduct in vitro egg hatchability tests. Nematode larvae collected from the feces were used for a larval exsheathment inhibition assay of M. caesalpinifolia leaf and M. caesalpinifolia leaf and stem ketone extracts at concentrations of 0.6 and 1.2 mg mL-¹; three replicates were performed for each concentration. PBS was used as a negative control. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) was added to the extracts to assess the effect of phenolic compounds on anthelmintic activity. An inhibitory effect of 80.7% and 82.3% was observed on hatchability after treatment with 1.0 and 2.0 mg mL-¹ M. caesalpinifolia leaf ketone extract, respectively. An inhibition rate lower than 75% was observed for 1.0 mg mL-¹ M. caesalpinifolia leaf and stem ketone extract. The M. caesalpinifolia leaf ketone extract larval exsheathment assay resulted in inhibition of 97.3% and 99.8% at concentrations of 0.6 and 1.2 mg mL-¹, respectively. For the leaf and stem ketone extract, the larval exsheathment inhibition was 94.3% at 1.2 mg mL-¹. The leaf and leaf and stem extracts showed no inhibitory effects on larval exsheathment after the addition of PVPP. These results showed that cuticular loss was related to the action of the phenolic compounds in the M. caesalpinifolia extracts. M. caesalpinifolia leaf ketone extract inhibited egg hatchability, but the leaf and stem extract showed lower efficiency, which indicated a greater abundance of active compounds in the leaves. The M. caesalpinifolia ketone extracts were effective in the inhibition of larval exsheathment at the highest concentration tested. Based on these results, in vivo studies should be performed to demonstrate the anthelmintic activity of this plant in goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27118/21439,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Quality of milk used in informal artisanal production of coalho and butter cheeses,"Artisanal cheeses such as coalho and butter participate in the socio-cultural identity of people and deserve recognition. Like many artisanal cheeses, it is common to produce coalho and butter cheeses from raw milk. For this reason, it is essential that the raw material from dairies is of good quality to minimize risks to consumers. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of milk in artisanal cheese factories in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Fifty samples were collected from areas that stand out in dairy production in the state. These samples underwent microbiological and physical–chemical analysis, as well as antibiotic residue and fraud searches. Viable strict and facultative mesophilic bacteria were surveyed, in addition to total and thermotolerant coliforms, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus; titratable acidity in Dornic degrees, density, cryoscopy, stability to alizarol, and percentages of protein, lactose, and fat contents were also measured, and tests for residues and recurrent fraud in milk were conducted. In general, all samples exceeded the limit established by law for mesophilic bacteria counting; Salmonella sp. was found in one sample. Given this contamination, the acidity of 76% of the samples was higher than allowed by the legislation. Regarding fat and protein parameters, 14% and 10% of the samples were below the required values by the legislation, respectively. Furthermore, there is suspicion of fraud by adding water in 24% of samples. Chlorides were found in 16% and antimicrobial residues in 46% of samples. Therefore, the quality of the milk used in informal artisanal cheese making in the state of Rio Grande do Norte is poor and may pose a risk to consumers, with the loss of quality of coalho and butter cheeses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26744/21438,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Chenopodium ambrosioides L. essential oil and ethanol extract on control of canine Ancylostoma spp.,"The use of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. has shown to be promising in the management of gastrointestinal nematodes. The objective of this study was to quantitate the yield and characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil of C. ambrosioides, as well as to evaluate the in vitro effect of the ethanolic extract and the essential oil in L3 of Ancylostoma spp. and the in vivo effect(s) of the essential oil in dogs. The effects of the ethanol extract and essential oil on Ancylostoma spp. were evaluated in vitro by exposing larvae to the extract at concentrations ranging from 0.005 g mL-1 to 0.2 g mL-1 and to essential oil at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 ?L mL-1. For the in vivo test, 26 healthy dogs, naturally infected by Ancylostoma spp., were divided into three groups: F1 - cookies were administered without active principle; F2 - herbal cookies containing 37.5 ?L g-1 essential oil of C. ambrosioides L.; F3 - cookies plus a commercial formulation containing febantel, pyrantel, praziquantel, and ivermectin. Complete blood counts and serum biochemistry for AST, ALT, AF, urea, creatinine, total protein, and albumin were performed. The yield of the essential oil was 0.3% m v-1, and its major components included ?-terpinene (1.24%), p-cymene (4.83%), and ascaridol Z (87%) and E (5.04%) isomers. The concentrations of C. ambrosioides L. ethanol extract used were ineffective against Ancylostoma spp. larvae. The essential oil at a concentration of 150 ?L mL-1 was effective against L3 larvae. In the in vivo study in dogs, the herbal cookies containing C. ambrosioides L essential oil reduced the number of eggs per gram of feces.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26470/21372,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Ex vivo biomechanical analysis of two methods of osteosynthesis in canine mandibular fractures,"Mandibular fractures represent an orthopedic challenge in veterinary medicine consideringthe large number of fixation methods that could be used depending on the location and manner in which the fracture occurs. Bone plates are a method of internal fixation that allows the correction of single or bilateral fractures, simple or comminuted; which appropriate material and technical knowledge for their use. Recent studies have demonstrated the superior strength that the locked plates present in relation to the neutralization plates, especially when used in flat bones or with lower bone density. The present study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical strength of neutralization plates and locked plates in oblique mandibular fractures in dogs. Sixteen hemimandibles from mesocephalic dogs were selected, weighing between 15 and 25 kg, without mandibular pathological alterations. Unfavorable fractures were performed between the 2nd and 3rd premolar teeth. The hemimandibles were allocated to two groups and stabilized with neutralization (Group 1) and locked (Group 2) plates. Both groups were subjected to the vertical compression test using the EMIC DL500 machine, sought to note the difference of maximum resistance between the implants. The statistical analysis used was the t-test and showed no difference (P = 0.135) between the strength of the group receiving neutralization plates (21.08±9.766kgf) and the group that received locked plates (25.96±7.029kgf). From the point of view of resistance to vertical compression, the neutralized and locked plates have the same biomechanical strength.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26324/21370,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological characterization and risk factors associated with leptospirosis and brucellosis in small ruminants sold at animal fair in the Sertão Region of Pernambuco State, a semiarid Region of Northeastern Brazil","The transit of infected animals may be a route for the introduction and dispersal of diseases, which necessitates protocols for the controlled entry of infected animals into herds. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-Leptospira and anti-Brucella ovis antibodies in small ruminants sold at an animal fair in the Sertão region of the Pernambuco State, Northeastern Brazil, and to identify the possible risk factors associated with seropositivity. Serum samples were collected from 233 goats and 119 sheep, belonging to twelve different owners from November 2014 to June 2015. Diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection was established using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); for B. ovis infection, the agar gel immuno-diffusion (AGID) test was conducted. A total of 16/233 (6.87%; 95% CI = 4.27% – 10.83%) goats and 16/119 (13.45%; 95% CI = 8.67% – 21.24%) sheep were identified as seropositive for Leptospira spp. The most frequent serotype was Icterohaemorrhagiae. In goats, intensive management system (odds ratio = 15.8; p < 0.001) and consorted rearing of equines and goats (odds ratio = 7.3; p = 0.005) were identified as risk factors. There were no risk factors identified for sheep. Seven (5.88%; 95% CI = 2.88% – 11.65%) sheep were seropositive for B. ovis, and the intensive management system was identified as the risk factor (odds ratio = 11.5; p = 0.005). This suggests that Leptospira spp. and B. ovis infections occur in small ruminants commercialized in the Sertão region of the Pernambuco State. Thus, improvements to the sanitary conditions of the facilities and the control of synanthropic rodents are recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26325/21371,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Occurrence and molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium sp. in sheep,"Considered a zoonosis of utmost importance, cryptosporidiosis has a worldwide distribution and can infect mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. It is caused by a highly resistant protozoan present in the environment and can cause death in immunosuppressed individuals and pups, as well as in farm animals such as cattle and sheep, generating losses. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in sheep feces from the farms of Western Paraná, which have different management styles, and compare the results with their respective management methods. One hundred and forty-four stool samples were collected (69 from Property 1 and 75 from Property 2) and analyzed using a fecal smear on slides after staining by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method. Samples tested positive by this method were subjected to nested PCR and the products obtained were sent for sequencing to determine the species. While 82.60% of the samples from Property 1 were tested positive, only 36% of the samples from Property 2 were tested positive. On analyzing the sequencing data, it was observed that the Cryptosporidium species of samples from Property 1 showed high similarity to Cryptosporidium xiaoi and those from Property 2, to Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. The reason for divergence in results can be attributed to differences in management systems adopted by each property, thus showing the importance of detecting carrier animals, as they can contaminate the environment, especially the water sources, and spread the disease to humans and other animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25837/21369,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Technical and economic indices that determine the profitability of milk production systems participating in the “Full Bucket” program,"This study assesses the relationships among net margin (ML), profitability (LUC), and return (RENT), as well as several technical and economic indices that determine the ML, LUC and RENT land-use change, and economic return of milk production systems. We estimate and analyze the property-size, zootechnical, and economic indices of 20 milk production systems located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2011. We also conduct a descriptive analysis of the variables studied, as well as a multiple linear regression analysis among the estimated indices (independent variables) and the net margin, profitability, and return (dependent variables). The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0. The items that most influenced net margin were milk production by labor, total revenue, energy and protein commercial concentrates, and the ratio of labor costs to total operating costs. Then, profitability was most influenced by animal productivity per day, fixed value by lactation matrix (value immobilized in the activity divided by the number of lactating matrices), milk revenue, and the representativeness of energy concentrates. Economic returns were most influenced by the number of males available for sale, as well as by animal productivity per day and the value of assets on land per hectare. These findings show that management and technological efforts are required to reduce production costs. In addition, animal productivity needs to be increased because it is has the highest positive relationship with profitability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25445/21368,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Detection of Brucella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk and cheese of uninspected production in the metropolitan area of São Paulo","Foodborne diseases are a major public health issue but their overall incidence is underestimated due to insufficient report. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of Brucella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk and cheese of uninspected production obtained from cattle bred on the polluted banks of the Tietê River. Generally, milk from these animals is used to prepare fresh cheese, which is then commercialized by the producers themselves or in local markets. We analyzed 81 samples consisting of 38 samples of cheeses, 15 samples of raw milk and 28 samples of water collected from the Tietê River. These samples were evaluated for the presence of the three pathogens using bacteriological methods and the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with primers specific for each bacterial genus. In the bacteriological examination, all samples were negative for Brucella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. In the PCR test, Brucella spp. was detected in 5/38 (13.16%) cheese samples. Campylobacter spp. was present in 18/38 (47.37%) cheese samples, 1/15 (6.66%) raw milk samples and in 12/28 (42.86%) water samples. Listeria monocytogenes was not detected by PCR. The detection of Brucella spp. DNA in cheese and Campylobacter spp. DNA in cheese, milk and water may reflect inadequate animal sanitary management and deficiencies in good manufacturing practices. The presence of these pathogens in the food and water may pose a threat to the health of the consumer and increase the incidence of zoonosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25341/21367,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of biofilm formation by bacterial strains isolated from milking equipment and milk samples from cows with mastitis,"The presence of biofilm-forming bacteria from the mammary gland of dairy cows adhered to equipment in the milking environment represents one of the major causes of bacterial resistance during mastitis treatment. The aim of this study was to identify strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli in milk samples from cows with mastitis, as well as in the expansion tank and milking set liners. We aimed to quantify the extracellular proteins and polysaccharides in the biofilm produced by each strain. A total of 294 samples were collected from a dairy farm in the municipality of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais. To identify the S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli isolates responsible for biofilm production, we tested the phenotype using the Congo red agar (CRA) and microplate adhesion tests. Protein quantification was performed with a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (BCA kit), and polysaccharides were quantified by the phenol sulfuric acid method. We identified eight strains of S. aureus, one strain of S. epidermidis and 11 strains of E. coli responsible for biofilm production, all of which showed a higher concentration of polysaccharides than proteins in the matrix. Escherichia coli was considered the most prevalent bacterium among the samples, and S. aureus was determined to be the largest biofilm producer. The results of the CRA and microplate adhesion tests were similar in regard to identification of the biofilm-producing strains according to their phenotype and matrix composition. The classification of S. aureus strains as major biofilm producers is of great concern for producers, as such bacteria are considered one of the predominant contagious etiological agents that cause bovine mastitis. In addition, our observation that E. coli and S. epidermidis can produce biofilms highlights the need to reassess prophylactic measures to avoid the adhesion of biofilm-producing bacteria.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24648/21366,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological characterization and risk factors associated with lentiviral infection of small ruminants at animal fairs in the semiarid Sertão region of Pernambuco, Brazilian semiarid","Animal agglomerations at commercial events such as trade fairs represent an important facilitator in infectious disease transmission. Thus, it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases in small ruminants. The objective of this study was to examine lentiviral presence in goats and sheep traded at the animal fair of Tabira city (Sertão region of Pernambuco) and identify possible risk factors associated with infection. We collected serum samples from 233 crossbred goats and 119 crossbred sheep, belonging to 12 breeders, at the Tabira livestock fair from November 2014 to June 2015. An epidemiological questionnaire was used to analyze the risk factors. Agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and western blotting (WB) were performed to diagnose small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection. In the AGID test, we used maedi-visna virus (MVV) antigens for sheep and caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (strain Cork) (CAEV-Co) antigen for goats. The WB analysis used CAEV-Co antigen for both species. Variables from the questionnaire were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistics. One seropositive goat but no sheep was identified via AGID. According to the WB results, 15/233 goats (6.44%; CI95% = 3.94 - 10.35%) and 8/119 sheep (6.72%; CI95% = 3.45 - 12.71%) were seropositive, totaling 23/352 reactive animals (6.53%; CI95% = 4.39 - 9.61%) from 12 herds. Annual vermifugation of the animals was a significant risk factor (odds ratio = 5.9; CI95% = 1.7-19.8; p = 0.04) for disease in goats, but no variables associated with infection risks were identified in sheep. We concluded that SRLV was present in goats and sheep at the animal fair. Western blots were more sensitive than AGID for SRLV diagnosis. Practices aiming to improve sanitary management may reduce the risk of infection in goats. All studied herds included animals identified as seropositive for SRLV. Therefore, we recommend adopting measures that increase disease diagnosis while intensifying traffic control and surveillance of animal agglomerations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24506/21365,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physical characteristics of baru tree fruit aimed at kernel extraction,"The baru tree fruit has a sustainable economical potential. However, the shelling process to release the whole kernel, the most valued part of the fruit, is still performed in a rather inefficient way. The objective of this investigation was to determine the physical-mechanical properties of the fruit to understand its behavior during shelling. Fruit and nut were characterized by unit mass, dimensions, volume and bulk, and real densities. Compression tests up to endocarp disruption were performed to determine maximum force, corresponding deformation, and deformation energy. X-ray tomography was used to identify potential nut internal dimension changes, affected by the treatments. Whole fruits and nuts showed average unit mass values of 28.20 ± 0.99 g and 16.52 ± 1.67 g, respectively. Their average dimensions, such as length, width, and thickness were 52.40 ± 4.48 mm, 38.31 ± 4.05 mm, and 28.64 ± 3.67 mm, and 50.78 ± 5.57 mm, 34.65 ± 5.14 mm, and 21.36 ± 2.86 mm, respectively. Average bulk and real densities values were 519.33 ± 49.63 kg/m3 and 918.87 ± 77.77 kg/m3, and 517.14 ± 41.88 kg/m3 and 1072.00 ± 187.01 kg/m3, respectively. Considering all treatments, the average rupture force ranged between 7926.7 and 9284.4 N, with corresponding widthwise specific deformation of 5.1% and 6.6%, to release 100% whole kernels of the tested nuts. Up to maximum force, deformation energy values ranged between 6.55 and 9.26J. There was no evidence of treatments’ effect on the internal dimension. Based on its mechanical behavior, showing that it is possible to open the endocarp and release the whole kernel, it was concluded that the baru nut has mechanized shelling potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26587/21364,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physical and chemical characterization and quantification of bioactive compounds in berries and berry jams,"Brazil is the third largest producer of fresh fruits in the world. Among fruits, berries such as strawberry, blueberry and blackberry can be highlighted for the benefits they provide to the body, owing to their presence of bioactive compound content. The phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, are examples of bioactive compounds that mainly function in the body as antioxidants. However, the processing steps that lead to the generation of derivatives from these fruits, are damaging to these compounds, often leading to their loss. Thus, the aim of this study was to physically and chemically characterize fresh berries (strawberry, blueberry and blackberry) and their jams, and also to quantify and to evaluate the antioxidant activity of bioactive compounds in berries and their jams. The following parameters were analyzed: moisture, ash, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, and color. The levels of total phenolic compounds, total anthocyanins, ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity were measured. We concluded that there were significant differences in the chemical composition of berries and jams. There was also a significant loss of bioactive compounds due to processing, nevertheless these jams remain good sources of bioactive compounds, and are still considered important to promote some favorable health effects.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26576/21363,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Buffalo mozzarella chemical composition and authenticity assessment by electrophoretic profiling,"Buffalo milk mozzarella is often adulterated by the addition of cow’s milk. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of buffalo milk mozzarella by using electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to detect the addition of cow’s milk. Reference cheeses were produced exclusively from combinations of buffalo and cow milk, and labeled reference treatment buffalo or cow (RTB and RTC, respectively). Standardized cheeses were made by combining buffalo milk and 2.5%, 5.0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% cow’s milk. A total of 9 cheese formulations were produced and either frozen immediately (time 0) or after 20 days (time 20). Eighteen commercial samples of buffalo mozzarella were sampled between 0–20 days of production. The chemical composition (moisture, ash, fat in dry matter, protein, total solids and defatted dry extract) and physicochemical characteristics (acidity) of the cheeses were evaluated. Proteins and water-soluble peptides (WSP) extracted from RTB, RTC and from the commercial samples, and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. It was not possible to detect the inclusion of cow’s milk by the cheeses’ chemical and physicochemical properties. However, the separation and detection of peptide and protein fractions of the cheese was possible by electrophoresis. The results of the electrophoretic analysis suggest that 28% of the commercial samples considered here had evidence of the addition of cow’s milk. The methodology described here is important to identify occurrences of fraud in buffalo mozzarella production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25533/21362,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Soil, water, nutrients and soil organic matter losses by water erosion as a function of soil management in the Posses sub-watershed, Extrema, Minas Gerais, Brazil","Knowledge of the quantity and quality of the material lost by soil erosion due to soil management is a basic need to identify land management zones in catchments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil management on the quantity and quality of soil material lost by erosion in the Posses sub-watershed, Municipality of Extrema, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Water and sediments lost by natural rainfall erosion were sampled from erosion plots located on a Red-Yellow Argisol (PVA) under the following systems: bare soil, subsistence farming (maize/beans/pumpkin/jack-beans/fallow), degraded pasture, well-managed pasture, and reforestation set up in 2013; and in a Litholic Neosol (RL): reforestation set up in 2008, bare soil, and native forest. Ca, Mg, K, P, N and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were determined in sediment and soil samples (at 0-5 cm depth) for the determination of the runoff enrichment ratios. Management influences soil losses more so than water losses. Minor losses were found in reforestation set up in 2013 (soil); in well-managed pasture (water); and in reforestations (nutrients and SOM). These losses tend to stability with time. The general sequence of nutrient losses was N > Ca > Mg > K > P in PVA; and N > Ca > K > Mg > P in RL. Loss rates of SOM and N followed the order: bare soil > subsistence farming > degraded pasture > well-managed pasture > reforestation, in PVA; and bare soil > native forest > reforestation, in RL. Reforestation and well-management pasture are effective conservation strategies in order to lower the erosion process in the Posses sub-watershed. Soil losses, as well as nutrients and organic matter losses were more influenced by soil management than water losses. The safeguarding native forest under Litholic Neosol is essential to the conservation of this pedoenvironment, especially in steep slopes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26562/21437,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, light organic matter, and remaining phosphorus under a crop-livestock integration system","Crop-livestock integration (CLI) is a management system that has been developed for a variety of soil and climatic conditions, which combined with the no-tillage system (NTS), has many variations in Brazil, particularly regarding grazing intensity. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of different grazing intensities and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops on carbon (Cst) and nitrogen (Nst) stocks, light organic matter (LOM), root content of the LOM (RLOM), and remaining phosphorus (Prem) in an Oxisol under CLI. The treatments consisted of three different heights (0.25 m [P25], 0.35 m [P35], and 0.45 m [P45]) of pasture grown in a CLI system. Two control areas, an area without grazing (AWG) and a native vegetation area of the Cerrado biome (NCA), which were adjacent to the experimental area, were compared with the cultivated areas. Soil samples were collected from 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m beneath each area in a completely randomized design with six replications. Soil characteristics were evaluated in the post-pasture cycle period (PP) and the post-soybean crop period (PC), which coincided with the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The NCA had more LOM in the 0.00-0.05 m layer during the PC and the 0.05-0.10 m layer during both the PP and the PC, C in the LOM in the 0.00-0.20 m layer during the PP and the PC, N in the LOM in the 0.00-0.05 m layer in the PC and the 0.05-0.10 m layer in the PP and the PC, and Cst in the 0.00-0.20 m layer in the PP and the PC than the cultivated areas, but a lower soil density (SD) and Prem in the 0.00-0.20 m layer during both the PP and the PC. Treatment P35 had more Nst in the PC and RLOM in the PP than the other cultivated treatments and the AWG. The absence of grazing in the AWG decreased the SD from the PP to the PC, while the treatments with different grazing intensities had similar values throughout this period. Our results suggest that production could be intensified under light and moderate grazing intensities in the CLI system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26622/21361,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fractions of soil organic matter in the vineyards of altitude regions in Santa Catarina,"The implementation of agricultural systems such as viticulture can quantitatively and qualitatively affect the contents of soil organic matter (SOM). These changes may modify the edaphic features of the soil as well as the soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical and physical fraction of SOMand to analyze changes in the carbon stock and C management index in areas of implanted vineyards in altitude regions of Santa Catarina. Four regions were selected: Region I (Urubici); Region II (San Joaquim); Region III (Campos Novos) and Region IV (Água Doce). In each region, we selected vineyards implanted between 2001 and 2005 as well as surrounding forested areas. Disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected from the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm layers of the soil. Samples were prepared in the laboratory to obtain air-dried soft soil, which was then used for the analysis of several parameters, namely total organic carbon (TOC), carbon stock,and chemical fractionation of the soil. The chemical fractionation was then used to determine carbon content in the fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), humic acid fraction (C-HAF), and humin fraction (C-HUM). We also analyzed particle size, quantified the levels of particulate carbon (COp) and carbon associated with clay and silt (COam), and calculated the carbon management index (CMI). We evaluated normality and homogeneity for all data. The results were evaluated with an analysis of variance and subsequent F-test. Mean values were compared using a 5% Student’s t-test and subsequently submitted to a Tukey’s test. The highest TOC levels were observed in Region II in the 0-5 cm layer in both vineyard and forested areas. Vineyard areas exhibited lower values of TOC, Cop, and COam compared to forested areas indicating that the management adopted in these areas contributed to the reduction of these fractions. Forested areas exhibited a higher proportion of Cop compared to vineyard areas. The humin fraction represented the largest portion of the TOC and comprised the highest values in both forested and vineyard areas. The carbon management index indicated a low contribution of vineyard areas or a reduction in carbon storage in their soils.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26555/21358,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Beet seed priming with growth regulators,"Seed priming is a technique used to induce metabolic germination processes. Use of growth regulators in seed priming may facilitate increments in physiological processes during seed germination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of priming and growth regulators on beet seed germination. The treatments were cultivar type (Early Wonder, Itapuã and Maravilha) and seed priming technique, which included a control (unconditioned seed) standard hydropriming (water) and a conditioning with salicylic, gibberellic and ascorbic acids, respectively. The treatments were defined by initially testing 0, 1, 2 and 4 mM ascorbic, gibberellic and salicylic acids. Before seed priming, imbibition seed curves were established to determine the optimal conditioning time. After conditioning, the germination, rate of germination, seedling length and seedling dry weight were evaluated. First, the appropriate dosage for conditioning was determined by using a completely randomized experimental design, with four replications per cultivar. Then, a 3 x 5 (cultivar x conditioning technique) factorial design was adopted. Whenever the results were significant by variance analysis, regression analysis was performed. Finally, Tukey’s test was used to compare the means at P=0.05. Beet seed priming alters the potential of germination and is influenced by the cultivar and conditioning technique. Pretreatment with 1?2 mM ascorbic, gibberellic or salicylic acids, respectively, promotes beet seed germination, whereas at 1?3 mM, the growth of roots and shoots of beet seedlings is promoted. The most effective techniques to promote germination and growth of sugar beet seedlings were priming with water, salicylic acid or gibberellic acid.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26513/21403,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The objectiv of this work was to evaluate the influence of light sources and culture media on in vitro growth and ex vitro survival of this micro-orchid. M. lundii seedlings were transferred to flasks containing the culture medium ½ MS and Simplified Medium, consisting of 5 mL L-1 of Biofert Plus® NPK fertilizer (09-08-09) and 60 g L-1 of ‘Nanica’ banana pulp. These flasks were placed in a growth chamber composed of seven environments, characterized by types of lighting: L1) LEDtube 4000K; L2) LEDtube 6500K; L3) L1 + L2; L4) L1 + L1; L5) red LED; L6) blue LED; L7) fluorescent lamp (control). After 200 days of cultivation, biometric growth parameters and leaves chlorophyll content were evaluated together with the percentage of seedling survival when acclimatized. At the end of the experiment, an analysis of individual variances and a combined analysis of the environments were carried out. The simplified medium led to higher seedlings, especially for light source L6. Light sources L1, L2, L3 and L4 promoted an increase in the seedlings root system in the simplified medium. As for the chlorophyll content, L4 and L7 showed higher contents of chlorophyll a and b. The simplified medium led practically to 100% of seedling survival, regardless of the light source used.

Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0-0.20 m in order to evaluate basal soil respiration, microbial biomass carbon, metabolic quotient, microbial quotient, content, and storage of soil carbon and nitrogen. Basal soil respiration, microbial biomass carbon, microbial metabolic quotient, and microbial quotient are influenced by the interaction between cowpea cultivars and irrigation. The cultivar Aracê showed greater stimulus to the microbial community, while the irrigation regimes with 214.7 and 287.9 mm (60 and 90% of ETo, respectively) provided the best moisture conditions for microbial activities.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26465/21355,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Economic analysis of corn inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense associated with nitrogen sources and doses,"Azospirillum brasilense is a bacterium known for its biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in corn crops. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research defining how much mineral N should be applied to maximize the efficiency of BNF and attain high, economically sustainable yields. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate whether adding urea with NBPT urease inhibitor might increase BNF in grasses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense associated with N sources and doses in a Cerrado biome soil by evaluating the grain yield of irrigated corn in economic terms. The experiment was conducted in Selvíria, MS, Brazil under a no-till system on a Latossolo Vermelho distrófico (Oxisol). The experiment was set up as a randomized block design with four replications in a 2 × 5 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of two sources of N (urea and urea with NBPT urease enzyme inhibitor) and five N doses applied as top-dressing (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha-1), with and without the inoculation of seeds with A. brasilense. Inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense makes corn growth much more profitable, irrespective of the dose and source of N. Addition of 200 kg ha-1 N in the form of conventional urea coupled with inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense increases grain yield; however, the highest economic return is obtained with N applied at 100 kg ha-1 with conventional urea and inoculation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26454/21354,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Phenotypic characterization of açai palm germplasm from the Marajó’s archipelago and Baixo Tocantins territories,"The açai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), a native of the Amazon region, is a food of great importance. Recently, due to the discovery of its nutraceutical properties, the rational production in upland areas has been encouraged. However, to support the rational implementation of its cultivation for fruit production, which is a sort of domestication process, it is necessary to identify its germplasm. The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the genetic diversity based on phenotypic characters among açai palm mother plants derived from 11 areas of the Amazonian estuary. Twenty-nine phenotypic descriptors were used: (i) 9 from the plant, (ii) 7 related to the fruit, and (iii) 13 of agronomic nature. Principal component analysis was used to assess the phenotypic variability from standardized data obtained from selected açai palm mother plants. In the selection of the descriptors, the methods of direct selection and selection with re-analysis were used. The disposal efficiency was estimated by comparing dissimilarity groups formed by 11 origins of the açai palms based on 29 original characters and 23 selected characters. The groups were formed using the average standardized Euclidean distance and Tocher’s optimization method. All the analyses were performed using the GENES program. The selection of 79.31% of the descriptors used was significant and was considered sufficient for the evaluation of the açai palm germplasm for fruit production. The selected descriptors were shown to be capable of quantifying the phenotypic diversity of mother plants of this species, consistently grouping them using the optimization method. The cluster method showed small differences in the number and composition of the groups due to variability among the selected mother plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26447/21436,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic characterization of the 28 maize landraces in Paraná State,"The characterization of maize landraces is extremely important in breeding programs for use of these genotypes as sources of genetic variability. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize 28 populations of maize landraces from the state of Paraná using the estimates of the effects of varieties and heterosis parents and the general combining ability, thereby assessing the main agronomic traits. In the crop of 2008/09, 56 inter-varietal hybrids, obtained through a topcross, 28 populations of maize landraces and three check varieties were evaluated for female flowering (FF), plant height (PH), ear height (EH) and grain mass (GY). The treatments were evaluated in a randomized block design, with two replications, at three Paraná State locations: the Experimental Center of the Agronomic Institute of Paraná in Londrina (IAPAR) and the experimental units of Pato Branco and Ponta Grossa. The data were submitted to an analysis of variance, considering a fixed model for genotypes and a random model for environments; the averages grouped by the Scott-Knott test, along with intersections of topcrosses, were analyzed according to a readapted model proposed by Oliveira et al. (1997). According to estimates of the parental effects, the GI 133 population showed the most promising estimates for all characteristics. The GI 088 and GI 173 populations stood out with promising estimates of the effects of heterosis. The conclusion is that the populations GI 133 and GI 173 may be indicated for recurrent selection programs or participation in obtaining composites.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26389/21351,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Models for moisture estimation in different horizons of yellow argisol using TDR,"The determination of soil moisture is very important because it is the property with the most influence on the dielectric constant of the medium. Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is an indirect technique used to estimate the water content of the soil (?) based on its dielectric constant (Ka). Like any other technique, it has advantages and disadvantages. Among the major disadvantages is the need for calibration, which requires consideration of the soil characteristics. This study aimed to perform the calibration of a TDR100 device to estimate the volumetric water content of four horizons of a Yellow Argisol. Calibration was performed under laboratory conditions using disturbed soil samples contained in PVC columns. The three rods of the handcrafted probes were vertically installed in the soil columns. Weight measurements with digital scales and daily readings of the dielectric constant with the TDR device were taken. For all soil horizons evaluated, the best fits between the dielectric constant and the volumetric water content were related to the cubic polynomial model. The Ledieu model overestimated by approximately 68 % the volumetric water content in the A and AB horizons, and underestimating by 69 % in Bt2, in relation to volumetric water content obtained by gravimetry. The underestimation by linear, Topp, Roth, and Malicki models ranged from 50 % to 85 % for all horizons.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26390/21435,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Super absorbent polymer application in seeds and planting furrow: it will be a new opportunity for rainfed agriculture,"Brazil is the fourth largest grain producer in the world. Its agriculture is mainly rainfed, with two cropping seasons per year. While the first crop (i.e., spring/summer) receives greater precipitation, the second crop (i.e., autumn/winter) is associated with greater risk of crop failure mainly due to the low rainfall, suggesting that technologies that could optimize water use during that period are needed. Superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are used in the forestry sector to reduce seedling mortality and the frequency of irrigation of eucalyptus and pinus glue owing to their ability to increase water storage capacity in the soil. However, to our knowledge, very little is known about the use of PSA in annual agricultural crops. To this end, the effects of PSA, as a seed coat or applied in the planting grooves, on the initial development of sorghum seedlings under conditions of water deficit were evaluated in two experiments under greenhouse conditions. In experiment 1, sorghum seeds with and without PSA coating were seeded in trays and subjected to three irrigation intervals to induce water deficit. The percentage of emergence and emergence speed index were evaluated and, at 26 days after sowing, seedling height, number of leaves per plant, survival rate, and dry mass of shoot and root were evaluated. In experiment 2, the seeds of sorghum with and without PSA coating were sown in pots, with PSA applied in the planting grooves. At 30 days after sowing, the plant stand, number of leaves per plant, plant height, and dry matter mass of leaves, stem, and root were evaluated. The results showed that PSA applied both as a seed coat and in planting grooves increased seedling growth and dry mass of aerial parts at 26 days and 30 days for experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, seed coating with PSA increased plant survival rate, but reduced the rate of seedling emergence in both experiments. Therefore, the use of PSA as a seed coat or applied in the planting groove has beneficial effects on the vegetative development of sorghum under low water conditions. Further research is needed to address the effect of PSA on seedling emergence.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26173/21350,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Floristic, structural, and allometric equations to estimate arboreal volume and biomass in a cerradão site","This objective of this study was to characterize the floristic, structural, and ecological groups and to estimate the arboreal volume and biomass of a cerradão site in Palmas, Tocantins, Brazil. A forest inventory was conducted on 10.15 ha of the study area. Plots of 400-m2 were used for systematic sampling. All standing trees (dead or alive) with a breast-height diameter (DHB) greater than 5 cm were identified and measured. Floristic diversity and horizontal structure were assessed using the Shannon and importance value indices, respectively. Forest vertical structure was classified into three stratata and the tree species were categorized into ecological groups. Ninety tree volumes were rigorously cubed and weighed. Fresh- and dry biomass were sampled and estimated. Mathematical models were applied and adjusted to estimate tree volume and biomass. It was observed that the species Myrcia splendens and Emmotum nitens and the families Fabaceae and Chrysobalanaceae were dominant in our study site. The pioneer (613 individuals ha-1) and climax (530 individuals ha-1) tree species group predominated. The floristic diversity index was estimated as 3.35 nats ind- 1. The vertical structure analysis indicated fewer individuals in the superior stratum (13%) compared to the medium (63%) and inferior (24%) stratum. The Schumacher and Hall model showed better results with regard to estimated forest production. Forest volume and biomass estimates were 126.71 m³ ha-1 and 61.67 Mg ha-1, respectively. The studied cerradão area had high floristic diversity and climax species predominated. Since this cerradão is in close proximity to the Amazon biome, its volume and biomass stocks were higher than those estimated for other cerradão and forest formations within the Cerrado biome.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26008/21348,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Water potential and time of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis inoculation in wheat seeds,"Wheat seeds infected with Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the causal agent of tan spot, are partially responsible for outbreaks caused by this pathogen. Seed lots with a high incidence of P. tritici-repentis must be rapidly acquired for transmission and pathogen-control studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether changes in water potential of culture medium and variations in inoculation time might favor the infection of wheat seeds by P. tritici-repentis without compromising seed viability. Colonies of P. tritici-repentis were grown on potato-dextrose-agar (PDA) culture medium, adjusted to a water potential of -0.36 MPa, under water stress induced by mannitol at potentials of -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.0, and -1.2 MPa. Analyses were carried out to determine mycelial growth index and seed exposure time to the culture medium to start germination as a function of water potential. Afterwards, wheat seeds were placed in contact with colonies of P. tritici-repentis for 24, 48, and 72 hours at potentials of -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.0, and -1.2 MPa. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design, in a factorial scheme (water potential × inoculation time). Rates of germination, seedling emergence in soil, and seed infection were assessed. Mycelial growth was stimulated at lower water potentials, which germinated faster. A 24-hour inoculation time and a -0.4 MPa water potential were efficient to infect wheat seeds with P. tritici-repentis, without hindering seedling germination and emergence under laboratory conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25973/21346,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Multivariate approach to milk production and some physiological traits of crossbred dairy cows,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in physiological responses and serum biochemical panel in crossbred dairy cow populations kept in a hot climate environment. We used a population of 384 dairy cows of genetic groups ½Holstein × ½Guzerá (n = 105) and ¾Holstein × ¼Guzerá (n = 279) derived from the Brazilian semiarid region. The physiological responses analyzed were: respiratory rate (RR, movements/minute), rectal temperature (RT, °C), free thyroxine (T4, µg/mL) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, µUI/mL). The values of RR, RT, T4, TSH and serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, total protein, urea and creatinine were determined and correlated with milk production for 305 days, correlation lying only with TSH. Significant differences were observed just in milk production, RR and TSH comparing the genetic groups ½Holstein × ½Guzerá and ¾Holstein × ¼Guzerá. In conclusion, ¾Holstein × ¼Guzerá cows showed higher thyroid activity and milk production than ½Holstein × ½Guzerá cows, and may therefore be a better option for dairy production systems in semiarid regions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27520/21543,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Toxoplasma gondii antibodies and related risk factors in mammals at Sorocaba zoo, São Paulo, BrazilToxoplasma gondii antibodies and related risk factors in mammals at Sorocaba zoo, São Paulo, Brazil","Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic zoonosis with worldwide distribution and different wild species either are involved in maintenance of the pathogen in the environment as definitive or intermediate hosts serving as font of feeding or prey to definitive hosts. The present study aimed to investigate Toxoplasma gondii antibodies and the risk factors relating to infection in mammals at Sorocaba Zoo, state of São Paulo, Brazil. Serum samples collected from 153 animals were analyzed using the modified agglutination test (MAT; cutoff ? 25). Seropositivity was found in 62 animals (40.5%; 95% CI: 33.1-48.5%), with different titers. Significant differences were observed in relation to the ages of the animals, origin, presence of free-ranging animals in the enclosure and feeding habits, through univariate analysis (p ? 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only age (p = 0.03) had significance for the study. Adult animals were 3.5 more likely to become infected than were young ones. In relation to feeding habits, herbivores (80%) and carnivores (46.5%) were the animals most affected. These results highlight the presence of T. gondii in animals at Brazilian zoos, and suggest that continuous transmission is occurring at zoos.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27703/21542,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Occurrence and phylogenetic analysis of ‘Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum’ in wild felines from Paraná, Brazil","Hemoplasma infections are emerging and wild fauna can represent an important reservoir of these pathogens. However, there are very few epidemiological studies about the occurrence of hemoplasmas in wild cats around the world. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) evaluate the occurrence and phylogeny of hemoplasmas in captive wild felines at a zoo in the state of Paraná, Brazil, and (2) verify the correlation between subpopulations of these bacteria and the hematological and biochemical parameters of the animals. PCR was used to detect hemoplasmas in the blood of three cougars (Puma concolor), a jaguar (Panthera onca), a tiger (Panthera tigris) and a lion (Panthera leo), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The cougars and jaguar were found to be hemoplasma-positive by PCR. The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences enabled the identification of genotypes of ‘Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum’ circulating in this zoo. The identified sequences were closely related to hemoplasma sequences originating from domestic cats and other wild cats, but the infected cougars and jaguar were healthy and showed no hematological or biochemical changes. It was concluded that P. concolor and P. onca are exposed to ‘Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum’ in Paraná, but further research is suggested to assess the resistance of wild cats to different hemoplasma subpopulations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27468/21535,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Hydroponic cultivation of Oncidium baueri,"In Brazil, orchid cultivation has been increasing steadily over the last few years and contributing significantly to the economy. It has been reported that several vegetable crops and ornamentals have been successfully grown by soilless cultivation. The orchid Oncidium baueri Lindl. is grown on pot substrates. Nevertheless, hydroponics is an excellent alternative, especially for the production of cut flowers and bare root plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the development of Oncidium baueri on two soilless systems: (a) pots containing Amafibra® coconut fiber, carbonized rice husk, and pine bark (1:1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution every 15 d; and (b) a nutrient film technique (NFT) hydroponic system irrigated with nutrient solution daily. Shoot height, pseudobulb diameter, and number of sprouts were evaluated monthly. The number of flowering plants, number of flowers, dry mass of shoots, and dry mass of roots were evaluated 11 months after onset of experiment. The pot cultivation system yielded more flowers and higher values for all vegetative parameters than the NFT hydroponic system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26794/21532,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of glycerin on digestibility of diets for pigs determined with different methodologies,"Glycerin is a by-product from the biodiesel chain whose energy value can be beneficial to pig diets. In this study, eight barrows were distributed individually into metabolic cages in a completely randomized block design. The animals were fed diets containing 0, 5, 10 and 15% glycerin from soybean oil and subjected to the methods of total feces and urine collection and chromic oxide marker. We determined the digestibility coefficients (DC); the dietary levels of digestible dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), mineral matter (MM), ether extract (EE), an neutral detergent fiber (NDF); digestible energy (DE); metabolizable energy (ME); and these last two variables corrected for the nitrogen content (DEn and MEn). Digestible OM values increased linearly with glycerin inclusion in the diets. The digestible CP of the diets showed an inversely proportional relationship with glycerin inclusion levels. Digestible MM decreased linearly when determined by the total collection method and quadratically when determined by the marker method. There was a linear increase in the digestible and metabolizable coefficients of energy, DE, DEn, ME and MEn of the diets as the glycerin inclusion level was increased. Inclusion of up to 15% glycerin obtained from soybean oil production increased the digestible fractions of organic matter and energy of the diets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28405/21530,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Does propagation method affect the field performance of peach trees?,"Worldwide, peach propagation has been performed mainly by grafting scions of desirable cultivars on rootstocks obtained from seeds. There are, however, other potential propagation methods not widely adopted due to the limited reports on the field performance of the resultant trees. This study addressed this knowledge gap and investigated the field performance of peach trees of the cultivar Maciel that were established in an orchard (5.0 m × 1.4 m spacing) in 2011. The trees were trained in a ""Y"" system, with seedlings from three propagation techniques: 1) Conventional System (CS) - vegetative bud grafting of the scion on the rootstock of the Okinawa cultivar obtained from seed; 2) Rootstock by Minicutting (RM) - vegetative bud grafting of the scion on the rootstock of the Okinawa cultivar obtained by minicutting in a semi-hydroponic system; 3) Self-Rooting (SR) - self-rooting of the scion in a semi-hydroponic system. The vegetative, productive, and fruit quality parameters were assessed during 2012 and 2013. The Maciel peach trees that were propagated by the SR technique were found to have similar or even superior field performance to those propagated by the CS. The RM propagation method was also found to be an important potential alternative to peach propagation, since this it combines two techniques (cutting and grafting) to reduce tree vigor, especially if the goal is high-density planting.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26374/21592,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mannan-oligosaccharide and organic acids for weaned piglets,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of acetic, propionic, and formic (50%) organic acids and mannan-oligosaccharide (50%) on growth performance, digestibility, and faecal score in challenged weaned piglets. Twenty male piglets (5.57 ± 0.32 kg of BW; 21-24 days of age) were housed individually in metabolic cages for 28 days in an acclimatised room. The treatments were composed of the inclusion (0.1%; n = 10) or not (n = 10) of additive in the diet. The experimental design was completely randomised with two treatments, 10 replicates, and one piglet per replicate. The nutritional matrix was supplemented with 10% of barley and 35.9 to 34.0% of soybean meal in the pre-starter diet (3-14 days post-weaning) and the starter diet (15-28 days post-weaning), respectively, to cause an intestinal challenge. Diets did not include any antimicrobial or growth promoters. Weekly, the animal and the leftover diet were weighed to evaluate growth performance. Digestibility was evaluated through total faeces and urine collection. Piglets fed diets with additive had 8.7% greater weight gain (P < 0.05) compared to those piglets in the control treatment in the starter phase. For other growth performance responses there was no treatment effect. Similarly, the inclusion of additive in the piglet diets did not affect the faecal score or the energy and nutrient digestibility. In the starter phase and throughout the experimental period, piglets fed diets with additive had 18.37% and 15.07% greater nitrogen (N) intake and 19.53% and 16.05% greater N retention, respectively, compared to piglets in the control treatment (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the addition of additive composed by organic acids and mannan-oligosaccharide does not improve energy and nutrient digestibility but increases the N retention and weight gain in weaned piglets in the starting phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28402/21529,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Dehydrated cassava co-product in starting piglets feeding,"Two experiments were carried out to determine the nutritional value of a dehydrated cassava co-product (DCC) and its effects on the performance and blood variables of piglets fed with different levels of DCC. In experiment I, a digestibility assay was performed and 30 whole-male crossbred piglets with initial body weight of 18.00 ± 0.673 kg were housed individually in metabolism cages and distributed in a completely randomized experimental design with 5 treatments, 6 replicates and one animal per experimental unit. A reference diet was formulated to meet the category nutritional requirements and the different levels of DCC replacement (6, 12, 18 and 24%) were used to replace the reference diet and composed the treatments. In experiment II, 120 piglets (60 whole males and 60 females) were used, with initial body weight of 13.05 ± 1.59 kg, distributed in a randomized complete block design with 5 treatments, 6 replicates and 4 animals per experimental unit. Treatments consisted of five feeds with increasing inclusion levels (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12%) of the DCC. The feed based on corn and soybean meal were formulated to meet the recommended levels in starting piglets feeding. The data were submitted for statistical analysis and, when presenting significant difference, the averages were compared by the Dunnet’s test at 10 % significance. In the digestibility assay, the values of DCC’s digestive energy and metabolizable energy of 3,022 and 2,984 kcal kg -1 in natural matter, respectively, were found. There was no significant effect (p > 0.10) of inclusion levels of DCC on the final weight and daily gain of weight however we observed a quadratic effect (p < 0.10) of the DCC levels on daily feed intake and feed conversion. For the analysis of blood parameters, the results showed that there was no effect (p > 0.10) of DCC levels on glucose and blood urea in the different treatments. The use of the dehydrated cassava co-product can be an energetic alternative to piglets in starting phase and can be used up to 12 %.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27814/21527,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance and physiological parameters in broilers fed different enzyme complexes,"The effects of enzyme supplementation on the performance, yield, and blood profile of broilers fed corn and soybean diets from 1 to 42 days of age were evaluated. A total of 960 male broilers were used, distributed in a completely randomized design, with six treatments and eight replications. Two diets were used: a positive control formulated to meet the birds’ nutritional requirements (Diet 1) and a negative control diet with reduction of 150 kcal.kg-1 of metabolizable energy (Diet 2) and 12% amino acid in the initial phase and 18% during the growing and finishing phases. Further diets were based on the negative control with enzymes: enzyme complex 1, composed of 125 g ton-1 protease; enzyme complex 2, composed of 100 g ton-1 amylase, protease, and xylanase; enzyme complex 3, composed of 500 g ton-1 amylase, protease, and xylanase; and enzyme complex 4, composed of 125 g ton-1 protease and 500 g ton-1 beta-mannanase. Enzymatic supplementation did not improve performance during the initial and growing phases due to nutritional imbalance, resulting in the worst weight gain and feed conversion during the finishing phase. Carcass yield, leg yield, abdominal fat, and pancreas were altered by enzymatic supplementation. Triglyceride levels influenced abdominal fat deposition, and the serum levels of albumin and alanine aminotransferase were altered by enzymatic supplementation. Enzymatic supplementation was not effective in restoring broiler performance, carcass yield, and cuts, with changes in the serum biochemical profile of the broiler chickens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27762/21526,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Measurements were collected using a tape measure, a hypometer, a 40 cm graduated ruler and a 180° protractor. PRCOMP procedure of the R program was used for analyzing the main components. The variables related to rump (height, angularity, ileum and ischium length and width), body (length), udder (height of posterior ligament) and milk production were more important to explain the phenotypic variation in Guzerá cattle. Young Guzerá cows had lower body length, narrower rumps, better udder ligaments and lower milk yield than adult cows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27724/21525,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Growth curves in meat-type and laying quail: a Bayesian perspective,"The aim of this study was to assess the goodness of fit for nonlinear models, using the best model to describe body growth curves, comparing the parameters obtained for gender and one meat-type (Coturnix coturnix coturnix) and two laying (Coturnix coturnix japonica) quail strains, as well as nesting via MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo processes) methods under a Bayesian approach. A total of 1,350 one-day-old mixed quail were used: 400 of meat-type, 450 of yellow laying, and 500 of red laying strains distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments (each treatment corresponded to one strain) and five replications. The experimental period consisted of 1 to 42 days of age. At 21 days of age, quail sexing was performed by means of sexual dimorphism, being individually identified at one day of age with numbered rings, allowing determining growth curves by gender. Birds were reared in a conventional system, fed ad libitum with diets formulated to meet nutritional requirements. Body weight was determined weekly and assessed using nonlinear models: Logistic, Brody, Von Bertalanffy, and Gompertz, whose parameters were estimated under a Bayesian approach via MCMC algorithm by means of BRugs package from the software R. DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) criterion was used to select the best nonlinear model, i.e. the lower the DIC value is, the better the model goodness of fit to the data. Gompertz model was better adjusted to the data regardless the gender or strain. Meat-type quail had the highest asymptotic weights and the highest age at which growth rate was maximum, followed by red and yellow strains. All nestings presented significant differences (p < 0.05) between gender for contrasted parameters. Meat-type, yellow, and red females presented values significantly (p < 0.05) higher for asymptotic weight (370, 203, and 215 g, respectively) when compared to males (274, 131, and 143 g, respectively), which were earlier in body growth. Gompertz model was better adjusted to body weight data of quail regardless the gender or strain and the Bayesian approach allowed obtaining accurate estimations. Meat-type strain presented the highest body asymptotic weight, followed by red and yellow laying strains. Females presented higher asymptotic weight than that found for males of their respective strains but were later in growth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27629/21524,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Chitooligosaccharide for piglets: effects on performance, viscera and intestinal morphometry","The objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-response effect of a chitooligosaccharide (COS) produced by Universidade Estadual de Londrina over performance, diarrhea episodes, visceral characteristics and morphometry. A total of 72 Pen Ar Lan® piglets were weaned at 23 days and 7.51 ± 1.35 kg of BW. The treatment was a basic diet plus inclusion of 0, 50, 100, or 150 ppm of COS (100 mg/kg). For the visceral and morphometric evaluation, 24 animals were slaughtered at 31 days of age with 11.01 ± 1.25 kg of BW. No regression effect over the performance or diarrhea prevalence was observed. Higher doses of COS led to higher absolute values for large intestine weight, villus height in the jejunum and crypt depth in the jejunum and ileum; the villus/crypt ratio in the ileum was higher until the level of 100 ppm COS. More lesions were observed in the intestinal epithelium along with a higher total number of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the duodenum. High numbers of eosinophils were observed in the ileum when a higher level of COS was used. In general, increasing levels of COS led to better intestinal morphometry and activated somatic cells in the lamina propria of the piglet intestine; however, no influence was observed in the productive performance of these animals. Considering all studied parameters, the COS level of 100 ppm was the most promising under these experimental conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27585/21523,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Defoliation height and potassium fertilization of Mulato II grass,"A pot trial in greenhouse conditions was carried out to identify at which defoliation height Mulato II grass (Urochloa hibrida cv. Mulato II) should be managed and to determine whether potassium fertilization is necessary in soil with high potassium content. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in a randomized block design with six treatments and five replications. Treatments consisted of a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, with three defoliation heights (50, 65, and 80 cm) and with or without potassium maintenance fertilization. The production characteristics and chemical composition of the forage plant were evaluated. There was no interaction effect between defoliation height and fertilization with or without potassium on any of the analyzed variables, except for mineral content in Mulato II grass. The tillers and leaves number, shoot dry matter, leaf+sheath, root system, and residue were influenced by defoliation heights and potassium fertilization, except for the leaf blades and root dry matter, leaf blade/stem+sheath ratio, and leaves number, which were not influenced by potassium fertilization. Higher shoot dry matter was observed at the heights of 65 and 80 cm; however, comparing these two heights, leaf + sheath dry matter was lower at 65 cm. Regarding the grass’s chemical composition, there was an increase in neutral and acid detergent fiber and indigestible neutral detergent fiber contents as the defoliation height increased, which resulted in lower production of potentially digestible dry matter, which can compromise the potential use of the forage by animals. Among evaluated treatments, Mulato II grass defoliation is recommended for a maximum height of 65 cm. Potassium fertilization increases the yield and the potentially digestible dry matter content of Mulato II grass, even when cultivated in soil with high potassium content.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27548/21574,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effect of stocking density on performance, carcass yield, productivity, and bone development in broiler chickens Cobb 500®","This study aimed to assess the effect of stocking density of 10, 12, 14, and 16 birds m?2 on performance, carcass and cut yields, productivity, and bone development of broiler chickens Cobb 500®. The experimental design was completely randomized design with four treatments (stocking densities) and four replications. The assessments were performed weekly at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days. The best live weight result was found at a density of 10 birds m?2 in the period from 1 to 7 days. No effect of density was observed on feed intake and weight gain. From 1 to 14 days, the best live weights were found at densities of 10, 12, and 14 birds m?2, in addition to a higher feed intake at densities of 10 and 12 birds m?2. Weight gain was better at a density of 10 birds m?2, showing no differences from densities of 12 and 14 birds m?2. In the period from 1 to 21 days, live weight and weight gain were higher at densities of 10, 12, and 14 birds m?2. The highest feed intake was observed at a density of 10 birds m?2, which showed no difference from the density of 14 birds m?2. A difference (P < 0.05) was observed for live weight, weight gain, and feed intake of animals reared at densities of 10, 12, and 14 birds m?2 for the phases from 1 to 35 days and the total phase from 1 to 42 days of bird age when compared to 16 birds m?2, which presented lower performance. However, feed conversion of 1-7, 1-14, 1-21, 1-35, and 1-42 days and carcass and cut characteristics showed no significant differences for all treatments. On the other hand, productivity was higher in the treatments with 14 and 16 birds m?2, but without difference between each other. No interaction (P > 0.05) was observed between stocking density and age for the assessed bone parameters. Similarly, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed for bone development of broiler chickens reared at different stocking densities for the studied parameters. Thus, the increased density of 10 or 12 birds m?2 to 14 birds m?2 has no influence on zootechnical performance, carcass and cut yields, and bone development, but increases broiler chicken productivity reared in a conventional shed without air conditioning.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27507/21516,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of dairy sheep lambs supplemented with crude glycerin conveyed in water during pregnancy and lactation,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of crude glycerin (CG) suplementation in sheep diets during pregnancy and transition period. Twenty-four Lacaune x East Friesian genotypes sheep were randomly assigned to four treatments. Diet was composed of roughage: tifton hay, and standard concentrate for the categories, being these similar among the treatments, whereas the CG differed for the supplements in (zero, 1,5, 3,0 and 4,5% of dry matter) being It added to the animals’ drinking water. The sheep received supplementation during all pregnancy and lactation. Dry matter intake during gestation was reduced with the higher supplementation of CG in the animals’ drinking water, presenting a linear decreasing response and remaining until delivery. Throughout lactation, the variable presented a linear behavior with the supplementation of CG on the eighteenth day of this phase, after a quadratic behavior was observed until the end of the evaluated period. The beta-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids levels were not influenced by CG supplementation throughout the gestation period.

1,1978,In vitro degradability of coffee husks treated with doses of fibrolytic enzymes for use in ruminant nutrition,"The agricultural activity has generated a progressive amount of waste, which needs a proper treatment to avoid negative environmental impacts. At the same time, values can be added to such waste, as its use in animal feed. This research was conducted at the laboratory of Animal Nutrition, State University of Southwestern Bahia, campuses of Vitória da Conquista and Itapetinga. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of coffee husks on ruminant feeds by increasing doses of fibrolytic enzymes, evaluating their effects on in vitro ruminal degradability of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (FDA) of the coffee husk (CH). The experiment was a completely randomized design in a 2x4 factorial scheme. It compounded the following treatments: Coffee husk (CH1): 1.5% enzymes (E) and 24 h enzymatic action (EA); CH2: 3.0% (E) and 24h (EA); CH3: 4.5% (E) and 24 h (EA); CH4: 6% (E) and 24 h (EA); CH5: 1.5% (E) 48 h (EA); CH6: 3% (E) and 48h (EA); CH7: 4.5% (E) and 48h (EA); and CH8: 6% (E) and 48 h (EA), all based on dry matter. An improvement in the degradability of the nutritional parameters MS, NDF, and FDA occurred with the addition of enzymes, with 3% enzyme addition being the best level, and 24 hours, as the best action time. In addition to that, as the EA on coffee husk increased, the degradation rate decreased. Therefore, the use of enzymes can improve the digestibility of the fibrous fraction, enabling the use of the coffee husk and possibly other agroindustrial residues, thus minimizing their adverse effects on nature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27501/21515,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Influence of vitamins C and E on the quality of cryopreserved semen Prochilodus brevis (Prochilodontidae, Teleostei)","Seminal cryopreservation allows the long-term conservation of gametes of various species, including endangered species, such as Prochilodus brevis. However, the application of this biotechnology can cause damage to sperm cells, reducing seminal quality. Thus, we have sought substances that minimize the damage caused by this process, such as antioxidants. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the association between two cryoprotectants and two vitamins, in different concentrations, on the quality of cryopreserved semen of P. brevis. For cryopreservation, the experiment was performed in two stages. In the first stage, the semen of 10 animals was submitted to six different freezing means, coming from the combination of 5% glucose, two cryoprotectants (Dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] or Methyl glycol) and two vitamins (C or E to 0.0001 mg) for cryopreservation. In the second stage, semen samples of eight animals were diluted in 5% glucose and the best cryoprotectant found in the first stage, associated with three different concentrations of vitamins C or E (0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 mg). In both steps, the in natura and post-thawed samples were submitted to kinetic analysis, morphology, and sperm membrane integrity. The cryopreserved semen with DMSO presented significantly higher results (p < 0.05) than that frozen with Methyl glycol, regardless of the vitamin used. The morphologically normal spermatozoa rate was higher (p < 0.05) in the vitamin-containing samples, however, vitamin E reduced sperm motility rates, independent of the cryoprotectant used. As for vitamin concentrations, higher motility rates were obtained when cryopreserved semen with 0.01 and 0.0001 mg of any of the vitamins. However, the higher concentration had a deleterious effect on the spermatic morphology of P. brevis. Therefore, the glucose associated with DMSO and the lower concentration of vitamin C provides good quality for the post-thawed semen of P. brevis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27466/21513,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of breed on food preference tests for dogs,"This study aimed to determine the differences among four dog breeds as to food selectivity, choice agreement, and the number scores that best evaluate the degree of food choice agreement. For that, 115 food preference tests were analyzed. In each of those tests, 20 dogs were used (eight Beagles, four Labradors, four Siberian Huskies, and four Basset Hounds), in two evaluation days. The medians of intake difference between two diets were calculated for days one, two, and for both days to determine if there were selectivity difference among breeds. A randomized block experimental design was applied, and medians were submitted to the test of Friedmann. Food choice agreement and the degree of agreement among breeds were evaluated by the kappa index, using two different scales. Basset Hounds were the most selective when two different foods were offered, whereas Labradors were the least selective. When performing food preference tests, Siberian Huskies and Basset Hounds are recommended; however, they must be used individually to prevent that the results of one breed could neutralize those of the other breed. The use of a scale of food preference with three scores is recommended in order to obtain results that are more reliable.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27399/21512,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Dry residue of cassava as a supplementation in broiler feed with or without addition of carbohydrases,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of dry residue of cassava (DRC) with or without supplementation of carbohydrases on performance, carcass yield, cuts and organs, blood parameters and meat quality of broiler chickens. Birds were distributed in a completely randomised design in a 2 x 5 factorial scheme, with or without addition of carbohydrases and five levels of DRC inclusion, resulting in 10 treatments with 5 replicates of 22 birds each. At 21 days of age, two birds of each treatment were fasted for 6 hours for blood brachial puncture. At 42 days, four birds per pen were slaughtered to determine carcass yield, cuts, organs, percentage of abdominal fat and meat quality. Between 1-21 days of age, there was an interaction (P < 0.05) between carbohydrase and DRC supplementation on weight gain (WG) and feed intake, which showed a decreasing linear effect without the inclusion of carbohydrases. In the period from 1 to 42 days, there was an interaction (P < 0.05) between carbohydrase supplementation and DRC inclusion on the variables WG and feed conversion. Carbohydrase inclusion provided an increase (P < 0.05) in the concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, gamma GT and blood glucose. Concentrations of gamma GT were increased and levels of alanine aminotransferase and creatinine were decreased (P < 0.05) with DRC inclusion. At 24 hours post mortem, there was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) for breast meat between carbohydrase supplementation and DRC inclusion for the variable L. The analysed values of pH, water holding capacity and shear force of the breast meat were not affected (P > 0.05) by DRC inclusion and carbohydrase addition. However, cooking loss was influenced (P < 0.05) by levels of inclusion of DRC. The L and a* variable and the feet of broiler chickens were not affected (P > 0.05) by DRC levels and carbohydrase addition. The colour variable b* showed a decrease (P < 0.05) from 5% level of inclusion. The results of this study show that DRC can be used in the diets of broiler chickens from 1 to 21 days old to the assessed level of 10%, provided that carbohydrase is added.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27314/21511,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Protein-energy supplementation for lambs: feed intake, ingestive behavior, rumen parameters and nutrient digestibility","The study evaluated the effects of dietary protein-energy supplementation on feed intake, ingestive behavior, rumen parameters and nutrient digestibility in lambs. Four castrated lambs with 31.9 kg mean body weight and fistulated rumen were tested. distributed into latin square design (4x4), four treatments were tested over four periods of time: no supplementation (control) or with supplementation at 8, 16 and 24 g kg-1 body weight. The supplement (soybean meal, soybean hulls, ground corn and minerals) was provided with roughage (Tifton Bermudagrass, Cynodon spp., hay), which was offered ad libitum once a day, at 8h00. In treatments receiving 0 (control), 8, 16 and 24 g kg-1 supplementation, dry matter intake was 685.26, 742.86, 842.51 and 1013.33 g day-1, crude protein intake was 80.18, 95.98, 118.64, 150.14 g day-1 and metabolizable energy intake 1.55, 1.91, 2.31 and 2.98 g day-1, respectively. Treatments receiving the highest supplementation levels spent less time with rumination and feeding and rested for longer (P < 0.05). Protein-energy supplementation level did not affect rumen parameters. Average rumen pH was 6.3 and rumen ammonia nitrogen 165 mg dL-1; both were affected by sampling time. Supplementation levels until 24 g kg-1 BW improves feed intake and nutrient digestibility linearly and changes ingestive behavior, lowering rumination time without affecting rumen parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27298/21510,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance and nutritional parameters of lactating cows on pasture receiving castor bean meal,"This study aimed to evaluate the inclusion of castor bean meal in the diet for lactating cows on Bracharia brizhanta pasture and its implications for nutritional and productive parameters. Eight crossbred cows were distributed in two 4 x 4 Latin squares, with four (0%; 3.33%; 6.66% and 10%) inclusion levels of castor bean meal in the total diet. The experiment consisted of four experimental periods of 21 days each. The digestibility and dry matter intake were estimated from fecal output, checked with the aid of external (chromium oxide) and internal (iNDF) indicators. Urine and milk were collected to determine the nitrogen balance and microbial protein production. The inclusion of different levels of castor bean meal in the diet for lactating cows did not affect the intake of dry matter and nutrients, and the same lack of effect was found for the digestibility of dry matter and total digestible nutrients, variation in body weight, milk production, chemical composition of milk, microbial production and nitrogen balance. The inclusion of up to 10% castor bean meal in the total diet did not influence productive parameters evaluated, and the use was conditioned to the price of castor bean meal.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27200/21509,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fermentation characteristics of different purpose sorghum silage,"Sorghum stands out among other plants recommended for ensiling due to its forage composition, its resistance to drought, and its planting range. New cultivars of grain and sweet sorghum that can be used for silage production are available, but there is little information regarding their ensiling characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics at the ensiling of different purpose sorghum cultivars, at two crop periods. The trial was carried out at the Plant Production Department of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rondônia, Colorado do Oeste campus, Rondônia, Brazil, and chemical analyses were performed at the Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, at the Federal University of Mato Grosso, Cuiabá campus, Mato Grosso, Brazil. The experimental design used was a randomized block, in split-plot design, with four replicates. The plot treatments consisted of six sorghum cultivars grown for different purposes (grain sorghum: BRS 308 and BRS 310; forage sorghum: BR 655 and BRS 610; sweet sorghum: BRS 506 and CMSXS 647). Split-plot treatments consisted of two cropping seasons (first crop and second crop). The grain sorghum cultivar BRS 310 was the only one that had suitable dry matter content for ensiling; however, it was also the only one that did not show ideal water soluble carbohydrate content for ensiling. Nevertheless, all treatments presented pH below than 4.2 and ammonia nitrogen lower than 12% of total N, which indicates that the fermentation inside the silo had proceeded well. For sweet sorghum cultivars, higher ethanol and butyric acid content were observed for the first crop than for the second crop. All evaluated sorghum cultivars can be used for silage production, but the use of sweet sorghum is recommended at the second crop.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27074/21508,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic diversity and virulence genes in Streptococcus uberis strains isolated from bovine mastitis,"Mastitis is one of the most common and costly infectious diseases in dairy cattle worldwide. This is a multifactorial illness caused by different microorganisms, including virus, yeasts, algae, parasites, and several species of bacteria. Among these bacteria, Streptococcus uberis is an important environmental pathogen that is responsible for a large range of clinical and subclinical mammary infections, especially in intensively managed herds. Despite the increasing importance of this pathogen in the etiology of bovine mastitis, data on its virulence and diversity in Brazilian dairy herds are scarce. The aims of the present study were to investigate the virulence characteristics of S. uberis isolated from bovine mastitis and to assess the molecular epidemiology of the Brazilian isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In this work, 46 strains of S. uberis isolated from bovine mastitis from 26 Brazilian dairy herds were evaluated regarding their genetic diversity by PFGE using with the SmaI enzyme. Additionally, the presence of the virulence genes skc and pauA, which encode plasminogen activators, and the gene sua, which encodes an adhesion molecule in mammary epithelial cells, were assessed by PCR. Our results showed a high genetic diversity in the population, displaying many different patterns in the PFGE analysis. A high proportion of strains was positive for virulence genes in the sampled population (sua [100%], pauA [91%], and skc [91%]). The high frequency of skc, pauA, and sua genes among the studied strains suggests the importance of these virulence factors, possibly helping S. uberis in the colonization of the bovine mammary gland. Surveys of the genetic and molecular characteristics of this pathogen can improve our knowledge of bacterial activity and identify molecules that have roles in the establishment of the infection. This might help in the development of more effective measures to control and prevent bovine mastitis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27726/21507,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic resistance determinants of Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from mastitic cows in Brazilian dairy herds,"Streptococcus agalactiae is one of the main causative agents of bovine mastitis and is associated with several economic losses for producers. Few studies have evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility and the prevalence of genetic resistance determinants among isolates of this bacterium from Brazilian dairy cattle. This work aimed to evaluate the frequency of the antimicrobial resistance genes ermA, ermB, mefA, tetO, tetM, aphA3, and aad-6, and in vitro susceptibility to the antimicrobials amikacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, penicillin, ceftiofur, and cefalotin, and the associations between resistance genotypes and phenotypes among 118 S. agalactiae isolates obtained from mastitic cows in Brazilian dairy herds. Of the resistance genes examined, ermB was found in 19 isolates (16.1%), tetO in 23 (19.5%), and tetM in 24 (20.3%). The genes ermA, mefA, aphA3, and aad-6 were not identified. There was an association between the presence of genes ermB, tetM, and tetO and phenotypic resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. Rates of resistance to the tested antibiotics varied, as follows: erythromycin (19.5%), tetracycline (35.6%), gentamicin (9.3%), clindamycin (20.3%), penicillin (3.4%), and amikacin (38.1%); conversely, all isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur and cefalotin. Antimicrobial resistance testing facilitates the treatment decision process, allowing the most judicious choice of antibiotics. Moreover, it enables regional and temporal monitoring of the resistance dynamics of this pathogen of high importance to human and animal health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27685/21506,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Body and testicular development and serum testosterone concentrations in Brahman males,"The present study had the objective of evaluating the physical and testicular development, and the serum testosterone concentration of 8 to 18 months old male Brahman cattle on grazing weight gaining performance tests. Bovine cattle (n=40), aged 259.76 ± 26.15 days and weighing 239.71 ± 33,94kg had the following characteristics evaluated every 56 days, corresponding to 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 months of age (six different data collections): body weight (BW), scrotal circumference (SC), girth (G), height at the withers (WH), body length (BL), body mass index (BMI), right and left testicular length (RTL and LTL, respectively), right and left testicular height (RTH and LTH, respectively), average daily weight gain (ADG), testicular volume (TV), and serum testosterone (ST).Analysis of variance and Tukey's test at 5% probability were used. Correlations between variables were assessed using Pearson's method at 5% confidence. There was significant difference (P < 0.05) from 12 months of age onwards for ADG and ST. There were differences (P < 0.05) for: BW, SC, G, WH, BL, BMI, RTL, LTL, RTH,and TV from 14 months of age. There was a positive correlation between: ST x G (r=0.38; P < 0.01); ST x WH (r=0.38; P < 0.01); ST xRTH (r=0.23; P < 0.05); ST x LTH (r=0.21; P < 0.01); ST x TV (r=0.22; P < 0.008); TV x weight (r=0.70; P < 0.01); TV x SC (r=0.90; P < 0.01); and TV x BMI (r=0.93; P < 0.01). A rapid increase in serum testosterone concentration occurred between 12 and 14 months of age, followed by rapid body and testicular growth. An elevation in testosterone levels is an indirect indicator that an acceleration inphysical and testicular growth is approaching. It is recommended to calculate both BMI and TV to follow cattle growth due to the high correlation between these variables.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27401/21591,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Bovine fetal testicular development in the Nellore breed,"The study of gonadal development improves the understanding of factors that can influence the reproductive development process. This study aims to characterize bovine fetal testicular development and the testosterone level in the Nellore breed. For the study, 162 bovine fetuses aged between 3 and 8 months were collected from Nellore cows at a local abattoir. The fetal age was estimated by DP=8.4+0.087L+5.46?L, where DP is the estimated pregnancy day and L represents fetal length. The fetal gonadal weight (g), width (cm), and thickness (cm) were measured. Thereafter, the gonads were submitted to classic histology processes in 3-µm-thick slices cut at 210 µm intervals. The Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and germ cells were counted. Blood samples were collected from umbilical cords for testosterone levels. The data were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test followed by Principal Component Analysis and one-way ANOVA to compare the averages between months. The testicular weight and volume were found to have a positive correlation with the numbers of Sertoli cells (r = 0.84; p < 0.0001 and r = 0.92; p < 0.0001, respectively), Leydig cells (r = 0.80; p < 0.0001 and r = 0.90; p < 0.0001, respectively), and germ cells (r = 0.84; p < 0.0001 and r = 0.93; p < 0.0001, respectively) and to be negatively correlated with testosterone plasmatic concentration (r = -0.31; p = 0.0001 and r = -0.22; p = 0.006, respectively) during pregnancy. After the fifth month, the numbers of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and germ cells differed (p < 0.0001) from the following gestational months. The highest testosterone concentration (p = 0.007) was observed in the fifth month of gestation and was followed by a concentration decrease in the seventh and eighth months. The increase in cell quantity was responsible for the increase in testicular weight and volume during fetal development. On the other hand, the testosterone concentration followed the increase in testicular weight and volume until the 7th month of gestation and regressed during the 8th and 9th months, in addition to the increase in cell number.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27308/21504,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Anti-Rickettsia rickettsii antibodies in capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus, 1766) from an agricultural landscape in Araras, São Paulo, Brazil","Spotted fever is a typically endemic infectious disease caused by rickettsiae from the spotted fever group, of which Rickettsia rickettsii is the main etiologic agent. It presents high mortality rates in Brazil, with transmission to humans or animals through the bite of infected ticks. The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is an important reservoir for Rickettsia spp.; these bacteria can circulate in an infected animal presenting only fever as a clinical sign of the disease, as demonstrated by experimental infection. Considering the high zoonotic potential and the damage caused to human, animal, and environmental health, this study searched for anti-Rickettsia rickettsii antibodies in capybaras from an agricultural landscape in the city of Araras, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) technique was used to detect anti-R. rickettsii antibodies. From the 28 serum samples tested using IFA, 18 (64.28%) were considered reactive, with antibody titers ranging from 256 to 2048. Seven (38.88%) samples presented titers of 256, three (16.67%) with titers of 512, five (27.78%) with titers of 1024, and three (16.67%) with titers of 2048. However, it was not possible to significantly associate gender to these serologic results. These results demonstrate that at some point during their lives, the studied capybaras were exposed to the etiologic agent, but it is impossible to know when this occurred. Further studies need to be performed to clarify which serological titers ensure an infection in capybaras, based on clinical and laboratory assessment of rickettsemia, and to establish the relationship between titers and the chronicity of disease. This is necessary owing to the possibility of cross-reactions with other rickettsiae species of the same subgroup, leading to the need for molecular tests to confirm diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27290/21503,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Modeling the hydration process of bean grains coated with carnauba wax,"Edible waxes are widely used to maintain foodstuff until they are consumed. However, some products may be subjected to industrial procedures, such as hydration, prior to their consumption. Hydration of a material is a complex process, which aims to reconstitute the original characteristics of a product when in contact with a liquid phase. An important agricultural product that requires this procedure is beans. Thus, the purpose of this work is to study the hydration process of beans (cultivar BRSMG Majestoso) in different temperatures and concentrations of carnauba wax, which is applied on the product surface. Beans with initial moisture content of 0.2015, 0.1972 and 0.1745 (d.b.) corresponding to treatments 0 (witness), 1 (wax diluted in water in the ratio 1:1), and 2 (carnauba wax, without dilution) were used. Later, these samples were imbibed in distilled water at temperatures of 20, 30 and 40 ºC, for 15 h. The temperature and the carnauba wax influenced the water absorption rate. The Peleg model described satisfactory experimental data and the Mitscherlich model presented biased residual distribution. The constants C1 and C2 of the Peleg model exhibited opposite behaviors with increasing temperatures in the hydration process.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27129/21501,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Bioactive compounds in different acerola fruit cultivares,"The increased consumption of acerola in Brazil was triggered because it is considered as a functional food mainly for its high ascorbic acid content, but the fruit also has high nutritional value, high levels of phenolic compounds, total antioxidant activity, anthocyanins and carotenoids in its composition. The objective was to evaluate the chemical, physical-chemical and antioxidant activity of eight varieties of acerola tree. The acerolas used in the research were the harvest 2015, 8 varieties: BRS 235 - Apodi, Mirandópolis, Waldy - CATI 30, BRS 238 - Frutacor, Okinawa, BRS 236 - Cereja, Olivier and BRS 237 - Roxinha, from the Active Bank Germplasm APTA Regional Alta Paulista in Adamantina - SP.

1,1978,Epidemiological characterization and risk factors associated with Leptospira infection in dogs from rural settlements in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil,"Rural settlements are defined as family-run agrarian spaces. Their purpose, based on public policies, is to strengthen family agriculture. They are peculiar environments that can predispose to the risk of diseases, especially zoonotic diseases, due to close natural contact with animals that can be sources of infection. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of anti-Leptospira antibodies in dogs from rural settlements in the state of Paraíba, Northeast Brazil, and to identify the risk factors associated with infection. A total of 306 dogs were sampled and Leptospira screening was performed using the microscopic agglutination test. In all, 27 of 306 (8.82%; 95% CI = 6.13-12.5%) dogs were seropositive for Leptospira spp. The most frequent serotype was Pomona. Street access (odds ratio = 3.53, p = 0.012) was indicated as a risk factor for infection. The results indicate that leptospirosis is present in dogs from rural settlements in the state of Paraíba, Northeast Brazil. This reinforces the need to limit contact between dogs and wild reservoirs and perform serological monitoring of swine. It also reinforces the need for implementation of control measures such as improvements in hygienic-sanitary conditions in the settlements, including the construction of pigsties away from homes, and the introduction of vaccination to reduce the occurrence of this disease, which will prevent transmission to humans and animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26756/21502,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In the first experiment, three yogurt treatments were processed, as follows: Treatment 1, yogurt produced with raw refrigerated milk; Treatment 2, yogurt produced with refrigerated pasteurized milk; and Treatment 3, yogurt produced with UHT (ultra-high temperature) milk, in addition to analyses of fat, protein, moisture, titratable acidity, and pH. The shelf life of yogurts at 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 days of storage, as well as pH, acidity, syneresis, viscosity, viable lactic bacteria, and total coliforms were also assessed. In the second experiment, yogurts were submitted to lyophilization process, performed by scanning electron microscopy analysis and subsequently in those reconstituted, in addition to being assessed the physicochemical, rheological, and viable lactic bacteria characteristics. The results found in the first experiment showed that heat treatment was positive for viscosity, syneresis, and lactic bacteria, being viable until the 15th day of storage only for yogurts submitted to heat treatment. In the second experiment, lyophilization preserved the physicochemical characteristics of yogurts, but the number of initial lactic bacteria was different, also negatively affecting yogurt viscosity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23087/21499,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Diversity and genetic structure of mangabeira (Hancornia speciosa Gomes), a fruit species from Cerrado","Hancornia speciosa Gomes, popularly known as mangabeira, is a fruit tree belonging to the Apocynaceae family, native to the Brazilian Cerrado. The fruit is widely used by the local population as an alternative source of income. Limited information is available about this species, which increases the difficulty of conserving its genetic resources and exploiting mangabeira as an economic resource. The objective of this research was to evaluate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of H. speciosa from Chapada dos Guimarães. Twenty-four trees and ten inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) primers were evaluated. Of the 57 bands obtained, 33 (57.89%) presented polymorphism. The analysis using Structure defined two different clusters (K = 2), which were consistent with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering analysis. The number of observed alleles (Na = 1.58), number of effective alleles (Ne = 1.29), Nei’s genetic distance (He = 0.18) and Shannon index (I = 0.27) were considered low among the population. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the variability within the cluster (83.39%) was higher than among clusters (16.61%). ISSR primers proved effective for detection of genetic polymorphism in H. speciosa, and could be utilized for strategies that aim at conservation, plant breeding programs, and commercial use.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27789/21498,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Water erosion associated with rainfall patterns in the extreme South of Bahia in eucalyptus post-planting,"Soil and water losses caused by water erosion represent a risk of environmental damage and loss of soil productivity, with economic, social and environmental consequences. Plant cover is an important ally against water erosion, together with the knowledge of rainfall characteristics. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the soil and water losses and to determine rainfall patterns in two homogeneous eucalyptus plantations; one in Yellow Argisol, located in Teixeira de Freitas, and another in Humiluvic Spodosol, located in Caravelas, both in the Extreme South of the state of Bahia. Erosion plots were installed, and consisted of three treatments: bare soil, eucalyptus, and native forest. Rainfall data was obtained from an automatic gauging station, with 10 minute registration interval for erosivity (erosivity index EI30) and rainfall pattern analyses. Higher soil losses were observed in Yellow Argisol, and the advanced rainfall pattern was predominant.

1,1978,"Characterization of sewage sludge generated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and perspectives for agricultural recycling","Sanitary sewage collection and treatment is a serious environmental problem in Brazilian cities, as well as the destination of solid waste resulting from this process, i.e. the sewage sludge, a substance rich in organic matter and nutrients, which is normally discarded in landfills. The aim of this study was to characterize the sewage sludge generated in four treatment stations in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil and check if they meet the legal criteria of the National Environment Council (CONAMA), Resolution No. 375/2006. It also focused on analyzing the perspectives for its agricultural recycling based on the potential demand for main agricultural crops grown in Rio de Janeiro State. Samples from eight sewage sludge lots from four treatment stations located in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro were analyzed. These stations receive and treat only domestic sewage by activated sludge system. For chemical and biological characterization of these lots, representative samples were collected and analyzed according to parameters of CONAMA Resolution No. 375/2006. In order to analyze the perspectives of agricultural recycling of sewage sludge in Rio de Janeiro State, 10 crops with the largest cultivated area in the state were surveyed and analyzed which of them are apt to receive sewage sludge as fertilizer and/or soil amendment. To determine the potential demand for sewage sludge in agriculture, the area occupied by these crops were multiplied by each fertilizer recommendation considering the sewage sludge as fertilizer. The analyzed sludge presented a high content of nutrients and organic matter and was included in the parameters of heavy metals, pathogenic agents, and bacteriological indicators stipulated by CONAMA Resolution No. 375/2006. The agricultural panorama of Rio de Janeiro State is favorable for agricultural recycling of sewage sludge since there is a great potential demand for this residue and, among the 10 agricultural crops with the largest cultivated area in the state, sludge can be used as fertilizer or soil amendment in eight of them. The implementation of a State Sewage Sludge Recycling Program could dispose of this material in a more sustainable way, as well as improve the quality of agricultural soils and reduce costs with chemical fertilizers, bringing positive results for sanitation companies and producers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27675/21495,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Earthworms and root-knot nematodes: effect on soil biological activity and tomato growth,"Earthworms are a representative soil invertebrate, and their living habits are known to influence a large diversity of organisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of Amynthas spp. to change the biological attributes of soil, and its potential to reduce infection by root-knot nematodes on tomato crop. The study was conducted in the greenhouse of the Diagnostic Center Marcos Enrietti, Federal University of Paraná, Brazil. The treatments earthworms at the following densities: control (absence of earthworms), two, four, six, and eight, which were inoculated into different pots, with five replicates per group. In each pot, a single tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum) was used, and a suspension of Meloidogyne javanica containing 3000 eggs and/or juveniles was added 14 days after seeding. During the experiment, edaphic respiration was evaluated at 96-h intervals. After 91 days, soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial soil respiration (MSR), the metabolic quotient (qCO2), dry mass of roots (DMR), dry mass of plants (DMP), and the number of root galls were determined per plant. We observed that inoculation with higher earthworm densities increased the MBC. Furthermore, the lowest earthworm density (two animals) resulted in a MBC that was 75% higher than that of the control treatment (earthworms absent). There was a positive correlation between MBC and DMP, and a negative correlation between MBC and qCO2. The DMR was not influenced by inoculation with earthworms. A linear increase in DMP was observed with earthworms; however, gall formations on the tomato root were not suppressed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27706/21496,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Chemical and physical fractions of soil organic matter under various management regimes in Roraima, Brazil","The crop-livestock integration (CLI) and crop-livestock-forest integration (CLFI) management systems, have been shown to be viable approaches for increasing carbon sequestration in soils, resulting in the improvement of physical and chemical soil attributes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical attributes and organic matter in soils under Natural Forest (NF) converted to different uses and managed differently: rotational pasture area (PAST), crop-livestock integration (CLI), and crop-livestock-forest integration (CLIF). The research was conducted at the São Paulo farm, in Iracema, located in the south-central region of the state of Roraima, Brazil. The studied soil type was classified as Ultisol. Soil samples were taken by opening ditches and examining layers at 0.1-m depth intervals from surface to 0.60-m depth. Total organic carbon (TOC), chemical and granulometric fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM), oxidizable fractions, and light organic matter in water were analyzed. Our results showed low levels of the analyzed chemical elements, a characteristic of a soil with low natural fertility. This matches conditions inherent in source material, weathered by high rainfall, a warm and humid climate, and flat topographic relief. In the 0-0.1 m layer, the PAST and CLI systems had the highest TOC contents relative to the other systems studied. At other depths, there were no statistical differences among TOC levels. The highest concentration of C in the particulate fraction (POC) was noted in the surface layer in all management systems. The pasture system had the highest concentration POC in the top 0.10 m. Our results also showed that the upper 0.10 m of soil in NF contained the lowest content of organic carbon associated with mineral (MOC) relative to the managed agrosystems. In addition, humin provided the largest contribution to SOM in all evaluated management systems. The crop-livestock integration (CLI) and crop-livestock integration forest (CLIF) systems, emerged as a strong alternative to carbon incorporation and subsequently the improvement of physical and chemical soil attributes. The objective of this work to evaluate the chemical attributes and organic matter in soils under Natural forest (NF) converted into different use and management systems: pasture (PAST), crop-livestock Integration (CLI) and crop-livestock Integration forest (CLIF). The research was conducted at São Paulo farm in Iracema, located in the Center-South region of the State of Roraima, Brazil. The soil studied was classified as Argissolo Amarelo Distrófico. The samples were taken by the opening of trenches in layers of 0-0.10, 0.10- 0.20, 0.20- 0.40, and 0.40-0.60 m depth. Total organic carbon (TOC), chemical and granulometric fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM), oxidizable fractions and organic matter in water were analyzed. The results showed low levels of the analyzed chemical elements which characterizes soils with low natural fertility, which matches the conditions of the source material, high rainfall and regional temperature, as well as the flat local relief. In the 0-0.1 m layer, the PAST and CLI systems had the highest TOC contents when compared to the other systems studied, in the other depths there were no statistical differences between the TOC levels. The highest amount of C in the particulate fraction (COp) was verified in the surface layer in all evaluated management systems. The pasture area was the system with the greatest contribution of COp to the depth of 0-0.0 m. In relation to the carbon content associated with minerals (COam), the results showed that the depth of 0-0.05 m NF area presented the lowest levels when compared to the other systems.

1,1978,Influence of vernalization and bulb size on the production of lily cut flowers and lily bulbs,"Exposure of bulbs to cold, a physiological phenomenon called vernalization, and bulb size are important factors in the production of lily bulbs and flowers. This study aimed to verify the influence of vernalization of bulbs on flowering cut lily plants, as well as the impact of size and shape of harvest on the production and quality of flowers and bulbs. In turn, the way the stems of the plants used for cut-flower production are cropped is of higher importance for the production of new flower bulbs. In this sense, the experiment was conducted in Viçosa, MG, in a greenhouse in a randomized block design, in split splot scheme with three replications, in which the vernalization periods (25, 35 and 45 days at 4 ± 1 C) constituted the plots; bulb sizes (diameters of 3.2-3.8 cm; 2.5-3.2 cm 1.9- and 2.5 cm), subplots and ways to harvest (full harvest of the stem at the required length for the commercial harvest of the flower, commercial stem harvest at the commercial length, maintaining 10cm of stem in the soil; removal of the floral buds as soon as their appearance is observed and harvest at the end of the season), the sub subplots. The bulbs were planted in beds, with 15 x 20 cm spacing. It was evaluated the number of plants that flowered and the number of flowers, the length and the diameter of the floral buds, fresh and dry weights, diameter and plant height as well as number, perimeter and amount of fresh and dry bulbs. There was a decrease in the plant height with the increase of the vernalization period and a reduction of the diameter of the planted bulbs, as well as of the number and the fresh and dry weights of the produced buds. The production of flowers and buds in number, size and weight was directly proportional to the size of the planted bulbs, while the form of harvest with removal of flower buds increased the number, the perimeter and the fresh and dry weights of the buds. Bulbs with diameter between 3.2 - 3.8 cm, stored for 25 days in cold chamber enable greater production of flowers and the highest stem height, factors that favor the increase in market value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27287/21492,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Substrate moisture and temperature in Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh germination,"Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh, a member of the Fabaceae, is commonly known as feijão-guandu. It was introduced into Brazil because it readily adapts to local climate conditions and tolerates a wide range of water and mineral nutrient levels. The objective of this study was to determine the substrate temperatures and water volumes that are conducive to feijão-guandu seed germination and seedling vigor. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Seed Analysis of the Centre of Agricultural Sciences, Federal University of Paraíba, Areia, PB, Brazil. Seed germination was tested using paper towel rolls moistened with volumes of water equivalent to 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 times the dry mass of the substrate. Variable temperatures in the range of 20 °C to 30 °C and constant temperatures of 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C were used. The experimental design was completely randomized. The variables analyzed were water content, percent germination, first germination count, germination rate index, and seedling root and shoot lengths and dry weights. Increasing the volume of water used to moisten the substrate hindered feijão-guandu germination at all temperatures. It was determined that moistening the substrate with water volumes equivalent to 2.8 and 3.5 times the substrate dry weight at 30 °C and 35 °C, respectively, were the ideal conditions for evaluating feijão-guandu seed germination and seedling vigor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26985/21489,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Growth and yield performance of soybean with the application of Bradyrhyzobium inoculant via furrow and seed,"Given the high costs of agricultural production, especially due to the price of fertilisers, particularly nitrogen, the use of inoculants to supply nitrogen to soybean crops is a widely recommended practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of applying inoculants through seed and planting furrow in soil previously cultivated with soybean and Brazilian native “cerrado” biome soil under greenhouse conditions. Seven treatments were tested: 1) inoculation via seed (inoculant + fungicide + micronutrient), 2) treatment via seed (fungicide + micronutrient), 3) control (only seed), 4) inoculation via furrow-dose 1 (recommended dose), 5) inoculation via furrow-dose 2 (twice the recommended dose), 6) inoculation via furrow-dose 3 (three times the recommended dose) and 7) inoculation via furrow-dose 1 + seed inoculation. We evaluated plant height, fresh and dry matter weight of the aerial part and nodules, number of total, viable and non-viable nodules, number of pods per plant and grain yield. Inoculation was more effective when used in cerrado soil, but soybean performance in treatments without inoculation was higher in previously cultivated soil. Application through furrow proved to be a viable practice due to the similarity of the results obtained with the traditional application by seed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27128/21491,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Quality of jackfruit seedlings under saline water stress and nitrogen fertilisation,"The lack of good quality water for agriculture purposes regarding salts and quantity in relation to demand for the plants has, for more than 30 years, been forcing the use of restrictive water because of salinity issues in agricultural production systems worldwide. In Brazil, the situation is no different, in the semi-arid areas, there are reports of losses of seed germination, initial growth of seedlings and yield of crops of commercial importance due to the salinity of the water used in irrigation systems. Therefore, an experiment was carried out from June to September/2014 in a protected environment, with a plastic film on the upper base and a thin screen against insects on the sides, to evaluate the effects of salinity interaction between water irrigation and nitrogen fertilisation sources on soil salinity, initial plant growth and the quality of the jackfruit seedlings. The treatments were distributed in randomised blocks, in the factorial scheme 5 × 3, reference irrigation water of 0.3, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 dS m-1, in soil with and without ammonium sulfate and urea. An increase in the salinity of the irrigation water to 1.32 and 1.70 dS m-1 on the substrate without nitrogen stimulated an increase in the number of leaves and leaf area of the jackfruit seedlings. The ammonium sulfate was the nitrogen source that mainly contributed to the increase of soil salinity and to the reduction of the quality index of the seedlings. Despite the reduction of the Dickson quality index due to the salinity of the irrigation water and the nitrogen sources, the seedlings were suitable for cultivation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26946/21486,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Productive characteristics of banana genotypes submitted to different irrigation water depths under Cerrado conditions,"Irrigation management associated with other banana agricultural practices can provide an increased productivity and improved fruit quality. This study assessed the productive characteristics of banana genotypes under different irrigation water depths. The experiment was conducted at the experimental area of the School of Agronomy (EA/UFG) in Goiânia, GO, Brazil. The experimental design was a split-plot randomized block design, in which four irrigation water depths (30, 65, 100, and 135% of crop potential evapotranspiration, ETpc) composed the plots and three genotypes (‘FHIA 18’, ‘Grande-Naine’, and ‘Prata’) the subplots, with a spacing of 2.5 × 1.6 m. During the experimental period (first production cycle), the total precipitation was 1719.20 mm. Characterization of genotype development and yield was performed with the following assessments: bunch mass (kg), number of hands, stalk mass (kg), fruit diameter of the second hand (mm), fruit length of the second hand (cm), mass of the second hand (kg), number of fruits of the second hand, total number of fruits, and number of damaged fruits. The cultivar ‘FHIA 18’, differently from the others, showed a significant response to irrigation water depths on productivity. In the genotypes ‘Grande-Naine’ and ‘Prata’, an influence of irrigation was observed only on external and visual characteristics of fruit (diameter, length, and number of damaged fruits). In the genotype ‘Prata’, the irrigation water depth of 965 mm allowed fruit production with a larger diameter. Fruit length in the genotype ‘Prata’ increased linearly as water depth increased. The use of irrigation promoted a reduction in the number of damaged fruits in the genotypes ‘FHIA 18’ and ‘Grande-Naine’.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26947/21590,E-ISSN 1679-0359

However, inadequate management of soil fertility has emerged as a major cause of low yield rates and of progressive degradation of these areas. The objective of the present study was to evaluate growth, by means of morphogenetic and structural characteristics, and yield of Brachiaria brizantha Stapf. cv. Marandu as functions of the application of the mycorrhizae stimulant formononetin, associated with lime and phosphate application. The experimental design was completely randomised with four replications, and the treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 x 5 factorial scheme, consisting of two liming treatments (with and without limestone), two formononetin treatments (with and without application) and five P2O5 doses (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg dm-3). Three shoot cuttings were carried out after a first standardisation cutting to evaluate the morphogenetic and structural characteristics as well as the dry matter yield of different morphological fractions. Liming and phosphate application at the dose of 141 mg dm-3 P2O5 increased growth and yield of Marandu grass, and these practices are essential for the cultivation of this pasture grass in Yellow Latosol of the Cerrado region of Piauí, Brazil. The application of formononetin increased stem elongation rate, total number of tillers and green stem dry matter, and decreased dead dry matter of Marandu grass, which are effects that contribute to the improvement of pasture quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26868/21485,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Use of the farmer’s experience variable in the generation of management zones,"In the spatial variability management of fields, the approach based on management zones (MZs) divides the area into sub-regions, which have spatially homogeneous topography and soil conditions. Such MZs should lead to the same potential yields. Farmers understand which areas of a field have high and low yields, and use of this knowledge may allow the identification of MZs in a field based on production history. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the application of farmer's experience to determine MZs. The study was conducted in three agricultural fields located in the west of the Paraná State in Brazil, and the MZs were generated considering three cases: a) without the use of the farmer’s experience variable; b) with the variable of farmer’s experience and the stable soil properties selected at the variable selection stage; and c) only with the farmer’s experience variable. The generated MZs were evaluated using the Variance Reduction (VR) index, Fuzziness Performance Index (FPI), Modified Partition Entropy (MPE), Smooth Index (SI), and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The study showed that the use of farmer’s experience to set MZs could be an efficient and simple tool, that it could reduce costs for the processes of setting MZs, compared to the traditional method of using stable soil variables and relief.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26722/21484,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The treatments consisted of application of biostimulant at 2.0 L ha-1 at different times and the control (no biostimulant). The time of application corresponded to the growth stages, V8, VT, R1, (V8 + VT), (V8 + R1), (VT + R1), and (V8 + VT + R1). The influence of biostimulant application was quantified as the difference in yield, expressed as kilogram per hectare (kg ha-1), between treatments and the control (effect measurements). Meta-analysis was used to study the effects of the treatments and to calculate the probability of yield increase with product use. The meta-analysis was performed using the software R. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis because of the high heterogeneity among the studies. Next, the mixed effect model was applied to explain the high heterogeneity, considering the following subgroups: the number of applications, the timing of applications, the presence of water stress, and the region where the tests were conducted. The probability of yield increase was calculated at the levels of 2, 5, and 10 bags, each of 60 kg ha-1. The meta-analysis results for the variable ""General"" and the subgroups were significantly positive (p < 0.0001), with a meta-analytic estimate of 342.1 kg ha-1 and the confidence interval for 95% probability ranging between 301.2 kg ha-1 and 383.0 kg ha-1. The probability for yield greater than zero or equal to 2, 5, and 10 bags of 60 kg ha-1 in subgroup ""three applications"" was 91.7%, 85.4%, 71.0%, and 38.9%, respectively. These same values were estimated at 91.7%, 85.4%, 71.0%, and 39.0% for the variable ""applications in V8 + VT + R1""; 79.1%, 69.3%, 50.1%, and 21.1% for the variable ""trials under stress condition""; and 84.2%, 75.1%, 57.7%, and 26.9% for the variable ""investments made in Southern Brazil,"" respectively. The meta-analysis of the data from 287 effect measurements generated in 41 trials demonstrated that foliar application of GAAP biostimulant increases corn yield by 342.1 kg ha-1 with 83.7% probability of positive response.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26676/21490,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Spatial variability of meteorological observations and impacts on regional estimates of soybean grain productivity,"Brazil requires a fully representative weather network station; it is common to use data observed in locations distant from the region of interest. However, few studies have evaluated the efficiency and precision associated with the use of climate data, either estimated or interpolated, from stations far from the agricultural area of interest. Hence, this study aimed to demonstrate the impacts of spatial variability of the main meteorological elements on the regional estimate of soybean productivity. Regression analysis was used to compare data recorded at three weather stations located throughout Londrina, PR, Brazil. The water balance of the soybean crop was calculated at 10-day periods and grain productivity losses estimated using the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) methodology. Temperatures at the three locations were similar, while the relative air humidity, and particularly, the rainfall data, were less correlated. A high degree of caution is recommended in the use and choice of a single weather station to represent a municipality or region, particularly in countries, such as Brazil, with multiple regions of agricultural and environmental importance. Models and crop season estimates that do not consider such a recommendation are vulnerable to errors in their forecasts. The volumetric and temporal variability in the spatial rainfall distribution resulted in soybean yield discrepancies, estimated at the municipal level. The consistency of the data series, the location of weather stations and their distance to the location of interest determine the ability of crop models to accurately estimate soybean production based on meteorological data, particularly the rainfall data. This study contributes to future regional research using climate data, and highlights the importance of a weather station network throughout Brazil, demonstrating the urgent need to increase the number of weather stations, particularly for recording rainfall data.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26165/21481,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance of reproductive system of Dichelops melacanthus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) subjected to buprofezin and pyriproxyfen: morphological analysis of ovarioles and testes,"The use of insecticides known as insect growth regulators, which are considered more selective to natural enemies, may be an alternative to integrated pest management of stink bugs of the main crops in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate histological changes in the reproductive system of Dichelops melacanthus as well as female fecundity and egg fertility after use of growth-regulating insecticides. The insecticides used were buprofezin (a chitin biosynthesis inhibitor) at a sublethal concentration (LC30 of 2.99 g L-1) and pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone analog) at a sublethal concentration (LC30 of 8.35 mL L-1). A completely randomized experimental design was used, with 10 repetitions and 10 insects per experimental unit. Two bioassays were performed: in the first bioassay, fecundity (eggs/female) and fertility (nymph eclosion) of the insects that survived the insecticides were evaluated; in the second bioassay, morphological alterations of the ovarioles of adult females and of the testes of adult male insects that survived the insecticides were evaluated. Buprofezin and pyriproxyfen did not affect the adult sex ratio or female fecundity. Pyriproxyfen reduced the percentage of ecloded nymphs (71.6%) compared with that of the control and buprofezin (96.4 and 90.6%, respectively) treatments and had an ovicidal effect, with direct and indirect action on embryogenesis. Morphological changes were observed in both treatments with buprofezin and pyriproxyfen. The alterations observed in female and male reproductive systems may occur by the action of buprofezin and pyriproxyfen on the morphology of both ovarioles and testes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26661/21482,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Serological survey of lentivirus infection in goats and sheep slaughtered in the State of Paraíba, semiarid of Northeastern Brazil","The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of antibodies against small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) in goats and sheep slaughtered in the state of Paraíba, in the Northeast semiarid region of Brazil. Blood was collected from 500 goats and 500 sheep in slaughterhouses in the municipalities of Alhandra, Guarabira, Esperança, Picuí, Monteiro, Sumé, Patos, Piancó, Catolé do Rocha, and Sousa. The agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test was used for the diagnosis of SRLV infection. Of the 1,000 animals analyzed, 28 (2.8%) were seropositive, with a frequency of 3% (15/500) in goats and 2.6% (13/500) in sheep. It was also observed that no significant difference was present in seropositivity among the different municipalities. The low frequency of seropositive animals can be explained by the fact that most of the sampled animals came from extensive breeding herds consisting of meat production native breeds and crossbred animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23318/21114,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocytes in artificial beaches of Itaipu Lake, Paraná, Brazil","Cryptosporidiosis is an emerging zoonosis that causes many outbreaks worldwide. Its main route of transmission is the consumption of contaminated water or food. In Brazil, data on to the occurrence of cryptosporidiosis in animals and in humans are scarce; thus, it is important to determine the occurrence of Cryptosporidium sp. and to identify possible sources of water and food contamination in order to prevent the disease and, consequently, preserve of human health. From July/2011 to March/2012, five liters of water were collected in 10 different locations from eight artificial beaches of Itaipu Lake, Paraná, in a total of 40 samples. In two other small beaches of the lake, water was also collected from two different sites of each beach, given their size and because they were made up of water from different sources. Samples were analyzed by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique and nested-PCR (nPCR). All samples were negative in the modified Ziehl-Neelsen; only one (2.25%) sample was positive in nPCR. These results indicate that PCR is a more sensitive technique for the identification of Cryptosporidium in water samples. In this study, it was not possible to identify the species involved and, thus, the source of infection. Water contamination by Cryptosporidium oocytes can be caused by livestock kept near waterways, and by the people who use the place for recreational purposes. These results demonstrate risk for people who use the lake. Care should be determined to prevent the transmission of this important zoonosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24923/21115,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Ecophysiological responses of dual-purpose wheat originating from different cutting management systems,"Wheat is one of the most cultivated cereals worldwide. Some wheat genotypes may be used for dual purposes that is, in the production of animal fodder and grains. The objective of this study was to compare the growth, partitioning of assimilates, and seed vigor expression of dual-purpose wheat cultivars originating from seeds produced by plants subjected to different cutting management systems. Dual-purpose wheat seeds in the vegetative period were used for this study; these were obtained from the cultivar BRS Umbu produced by plants subjected to different cutting management systems. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme, with four replications. The treatments comprised a combination of four seed production systems (one, two, and three cuts) and eight planting seasons (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 days after emergence [DAE]). Total dry-mass, dry-mass production rate, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, leaf area index, solar energy conversion efficiency, dry-mass partitioning, seedling emergence in the field, and emergence speed index were evaluated. Data regarding seedling emergence and emergence speed index were adjusted by orthogonal polynomials. Primary growth data were evaluated from the simple logistic equation. From 60 DAE, an inversion of the values of total dry-mass was observed, and the maximum values were observed in plants from seeds produced without cutting management. The highest dry-mass production rates were noted for plants produced by seeds of plants not subjected to cutting management. The highest relative growth rates were noted among plants originating from seeds produced by plants subjected to three- and two-cut treatments. The net assimilation rate was higher in plants originating from seeds produced from plants subjected to cutting management systems. The highest values of emergence were observed for seeds obtained from the three-cut treatment. Similarly, an increase in the values of emergence speed index was observed in seeds from plants subjected to one-cut treatment. Dual-purpose wheat cultivars originating from seeds produced in the absence of cutting management presented higher total dry-mass, dry-mass production rate, and relative growth rate. The net assimilation rate was higher in plants from seeds produced with cutting management systems. Plants produced from seeds subjected to the three-cut production management resulted in more vigorous seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25787/21082,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Genetic diversity of a natural population of Mezilaurus itauba (Meisn.) Taub. ex Mez. in the southern Amazon, Brazil","Genetic diversity studies in natural forest species populations have consistently expanded in recent years. Considering that biodiversity is directly related to genetic variation among and within populations, its study has become essential to the knowledge of genetic patterns. The study assessed genetic diversity of a Mezilaurus itauba population, detecting similarity and dissimilarity evaluating distribution intensity of adult and juvenile trees in remnant rain forest fragments in southern Amazon, Brazil. Leaf and cambium samples were randomly collected from 36 reproductive individuals. Eleven RAPD (random-amplified polymorphic DNA) primers were tested for genetic similarity analyses. The obtained data demonstrated that the species presented 79.77% polymorphism among the loci observed, with genetic diversity occurring between juvenile and adult trees. The population studied presented genetic diversity, forming three well-distinguished groups.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26135/21081,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of propolis extract on the parasite load of Nile tilapias reared in cages,"Due to increase in demand for healthy and chemical residue-free products, natural therapeutic substances are being enhanced in fish cultivation. Current study evaluates in an unprecedented way (he effect of propolis on the parasite charge of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared in fish cages. Six hundred male Nile tilapia (200g) conditioned in ten 1 m3 cages were used. Two treatments with five replications each were provided: TCON: control (extruded meal without propolis) and TPRO: extruded meal with 4% propolis extract. Parasite collection occurred on 0, 35, 70 and 105 days. At the same time, fillet was weighed and fish standard length measured. Temperature was kept within the comfort range for the species during the experimental period ( > 25ºC). Trichodinids and Monogenoids (Dactylogyridae) were detected in the two treatments. There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) in mean parasite intensity (total parasites/specimens with parasites) and abundance (total parasites/examined specimens) among treatments in the four evaluation periods. Lowest parasite prevalence occurred after 70 days in TPRO (26.66%). There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) among treatments with regard to fillet weight and standard length of fish. Results show that propolis extract 4% did not significantly affect parasite load, fillet weight and standard length of Nile tilapia.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27131/21080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Agronomic and nutritional characteristics of Massai grass subjected to deferred grazing and nitrogen fertilization,"This study aimed to evaluate the agronomic characteristics and nutritional value of Massai grass (Megathyrsus maximus ‘Massai’) pastures fertilized with different nitrogen levels and subjected to deferred grazing. A completely randomized experimental design (CRD) was adopted, with including five nitrogen levels (zero, 100, 200, 300, and 400 kg ha?1), and five replications (plots). The degradability trial used a CRD including a 6 × 5 factorial arrangement, consisting of six rumen-incubation times (6, 24, 48, 60, 84, and 96 h) and five levels of nitrogen in different plots. One fistulated sheep, with a live weight of 60 kg, was used in the experiment. Total herbage biomass, dead herbage biomass, and height showed a quadratic response to nitrogen fertilization levels of 100 to 200 kg ha-1 resulted in greater tillering. Protein and dry matter content increased linearly with nitrogen fertilization level, leading to increase in fibrous components. The increase in NDF and ADF contents might be a consequence of the reduction in NCE, and the high flowering rate of the grass, owing likely to the reduction in metabolism of the grass in an attempt to extend its lifetime. Nitrogen levels of 300 kg ha?1 or higher affected the productive characteristics positively, whereas the chemical characteristics were negatively affected.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26884/21079,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Carcass and meat traits, and non-carcass components of lambs fed ration containing increasing levels of urea","The objective of this study was to evaluate the carcass and meat traits, and the non-carcass components of crossbred Dorper lambs fed diets with increasing levels of urea (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of dry matter – DM). The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments (urea inclusion levels) and six replicates per treatment. Lambs were fed ad libitum for 56 days and slaughtered at 37.9 ± 5.1 kg of body weight (BW). The weight and yield of carcass before and after cooling were not influenced by urea levels, with average values of 16.9 kg and 44.6% for cold carcass weight and yield. Urea levels did not affect the morphometric measurements, the fat deposition on the carcass, the weight of carcass cuts and the weight of non-carcass components. There was a quadratic effect of urea levels on the loin yield, which may achieve maximum value of 11.31% with the inclusion of 0.84% DM urea in the feed. The pH and the color coordinates L* (brightness), a* (red intensity) and C* (saturation) of the meat also showed quadratic response to the urea levels, where in the minimum value of 5.53 for pH, maximum value of 48.67 for L* and minimum values of 14.04 and 16.21 for a* and C* may be obtained by including 0.53 to 0.70% DM urea in the ration. The inclusion of 0.84% DM urea in the ration is recommended to obtain maximum yield of loin and meat with attractive characteristics to the consumer, which is characterized by high red intensity and brightness. If consumers have preference for lamb meat with a more intense red color, the inclusion of 1.5% DM urea should be considered in the ration formulation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26733/21077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of processing and the physical form of diets on digestibility and the performance of nursery piglets,"The aim of this study was to assess the influence of various diet processing methods and physical forms on digestibility and zootechnical performance parameters of nursery piglets. The study was performed in 2 phases. The first phase was performed twice with 120 piglets per experiment, for a total of 240 newly weaned piglets, in a randomized block design with 6 treatments and 5 replicates (30 pens). The following experimental diets were offered from weaning to 21 days after weaning (initial nursery phase) and included the following: mash diet (M); mash diet conditioned at 60ºC (CM); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 2.5 mm (P2.5); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 2.5 mm and crumbled (P2.5C); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 4.75 mm (P4.75); and diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 4.75 mm and crumbled (P4.75C). The animals’ daily weight gain (DWG), daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion (FC) were assessed. Phase 2 used 24 piglets (33 days old) from Phase 1, which were lodged in individual metabolic cages. The experiment employed a randomized block design with 4 treatments and 6 replicates: mash diet (M); mash diet conditioned at 60ºC (CM); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 2.5 mm (P2.5); and diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 4.75 mm (P4.75). Feces were collected to analyze the digestibility of and apparent digestible energy in dry matter, gross energy and ether extract. The processing and physical form of the diets did not affect the DWG and DFI of the 21- to 39-day-old piglets. The 2.5-mm-diameter pellets induced better FC compared to the crumbled and conditioned crumbled diets (P < 0.05), which might be attributed to the better digestibility of the ether extract in the pelleted diets. Pellet size had no effect on the performance parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26631/21076,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fermentation kinetics and ruminal parameters of animals fed diets containing Brazil nut cake inclusion levels,"The inclusion effect of 0 (control), 15, 30, 45, 60, and 100% dry matter (DM) of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) cake (BNC) aiming at replacing corn silage was assessed on fermentation kinetics and effective degradability (ED) by means of in vitro gas production at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. A randomized block design was used with six treatments, three blocks, and two replications per block. France’s model was fit to the data. An in vivo experiment, conducted in fistulated ovine, assessed the effects of BNC inclusion levels of 0, 15, 30, and 45% DM replacing corn silage on ruminal parameters. Ruminal fluid samples were collected postprandial at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 h for determining the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), pH, and N–NH3. A completely randomized design with repeated measures in time was used, with four treatments and three replications. Results of acetate, propionate, butyrate, acetate to propionate ratio, pH, and NH3 were submitted to analysis of variance and regression (linear and quadratic) considering treatment, time and interaction of both. In addition, the F test with a 5% (P < 0.05) significance level was applied to the data. Fermentation kinetics pattern and ED presented a linear decreasing (P < 0.05), which means a decrease in total gas production at each coproduct inclusion level. No interaction effect between treatment and time was observed for total SCFA (P > 0.40), acetic acid (P > 0.41), propionic acid (P > 0.85), butyric acid (P > 0.62) and pH (P > 0.57). BNC replacements of 0, 15, 30 and 45% did not change (P > 0.05) total SCFA concentration, as well as acetic acid concentration in ovine. When including 45% DM of BNC, concentrations (mMol/100 mL) of propionic (P < 0.001) and butyric (P < 0.022) acids was reduced in the ruminal fluid. The highest concentrations at measurement times were observed 4 hours after feeding. The pH values presented a quadratic effect on both inclusion (P < 0.001) and time (P < 0.001). An interaction was observed between treatment and time for N–NH3 concentration (mg/ml) (P < 0.001) and acetic to propionic acids ratio (P < 0.014). Fermentation kinetics was negatively affected by Brazil nut cake inclusion to corn silage-based diet. Therefore, the use of this coproduct is recommended associated with non-structural carbohydrate sources.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26843/21078,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Anthelmintic treatment and supplementation in Nellore calves performance in the post-weaning period,"The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of anthelmintic treatment and supplementation of post-weaning Nellore calves. The parasitism degree, hematological changes and animal performance were analyzed, as well as the financial viability. One hundred contemporary Nellore calves were used. Animals were divided into four groups: CS+AT: supplementation with concentrate and anthelmintic treatment; CS: supplementation with concentrate; PS+AT: protein mineral supplementation and anthelmintic treatment; PS: protein mineral supplementation. Coproparasitological, hematological, and cost examinations were performed, and productive performance was also evaluated. A completely randomized design was used. Animals that received CS+AT showed greater weight gain. In females, there was significant difference in egg counts per gram of feces only between the CS and PS+AT. In males, animals receiving CS+AT, CS, and PS+AT differ from those receiving PS. No significant effects were observed for total plasma protein, packed cell volume, and eosinophils count. Females which received PS+AT and males who received CS+AT showed higher profitability. This study concludes that effective anthelmintic use is still viable, with higher profitability associated with concentrated supplementation in males, and mineral protein supplementation in females. Male calves show better return over investment when compared to females, due to the higher market value and higher potential performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26579/21074,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of husbandry system on the technical and economic performance of dairy cattle,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of husbandry system on the technical and economic performance of dairy farming. Samples included data from 61 dairy farms from the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which were collected between 2002 and 2011. Farms were categorized by type-pasture-based (PB), semi-confinement (SC), and confinement (C)-and technical and economic indexes were compared. In general, the results indicated indexes that are higher than the average for Brazilian farms but lower than those in other countries or technological farms in other Brazilian regions. Milk production was mainly determined by farm size rather than by productivity indexes. Components of the total and effective operational costs that were most significant were feeding followed by labor. The comparative analysis indicated that, although C systems have technical indexes that are superior to those of the PB and SC systems, economic performance was independent of the intensification level. Thus, pasture systems are potentially competitive, provided that the producers are efficient.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26596/21075,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of planting pattern of forage sorghum on forage productivity and heifer performance during finishing phase,"This study aimed to assess the effect of sorghum planting patterns on forage response and performance of beef heifers at finishing phase. The experimental period lasted 84 days; treatments consisted of the combination of two interrow spacings (22 and 44 cm) and two sorghum-sowing rates (12 and 24 kg ha?1). Beef heifers, at finishing phase, with initial age of 15 months (± 2.3 months) and average body weight of 262 kg (± 37.95 kg), continuously grazed forage. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme with three repetitions per area. The different planting patterns did not affect (P > 0.05) dry matter production (5,447.78 kg DM ha?1) and accumulation rate (58.47 kg DM ha?1 day?1). Forage accumulation rate, leaf mass, forage mass, leaf supply and forage supply were influenced (P < 0.05) by time. Similar behavior was observed for stocking rate, weight gain per area unit and daily weight gain, with values of 1,172.32 kg of liveweight ha?1, 312.31 kg ha?1; 0.891 kg day?1, respectively. Animal performance had no effect (P > 0.05) from planting patterns, with nearly 4.04 mm of subcutaneous fat thickness and final weight of 330.36 kg. Animal body development showed no significant differences (P > 0.05), with values for length, heart girth and hip height of 132.01, 163.75 and 126.75 cm, respectively. The weight to average height ratio between planting patterns was 2.67 kg cm?1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26508/21073,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Structural characteristics of elephant grass fertilized with organic composted waste from production and slaughter of small ruminants,"This study aimed to evaluate the morphophysiological characteristics of irrigated Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cameroon subjected to doses of an organic compost from waste generated by production and slaughter of small ruminants. The experiment was carried out in a grassland, during four growth cycles of 60 days. The area is located in the Embrapa Caprinos e Ovinos unit, in Sobral - CE, Brazil. Treatments consisted of organic compost doses (0, 13.3, 26.6, 39.9, 53.2 and 79.8 Mg ha-1) plus a mineral fertilization (nitrogen and potassium) at doses equivalent to 720 and 900 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively. The experimental design was arranged in completely randomized blocks, totaling four blocks with seven treatments each, in a split plot scheme with repeated readings over time. The plots corresponded to seven doses of an organic compost and an additional treatment (mineral fertilizer), and subplots to four growth cycles. The variables analyzed were total herbage biomass (THB), canopy height (CH), tiller population density (TPD) and water use efficiency for green leaf biomass production (WUEGLB) and green stem biomass (WUEGSB). In the first cycle, TPD decreased linearly with increasing doses of the compost, with 47 tillers m2 at the dose of 79.8 Mg ha-1, while THB and WUEGLB variables behaved quadratically, with a maximum point of 23.53 Mg DM ha-1 cycle-1, and 16.33 kg DM mm-1 for the doses of 66.52 and 62.94 Mg ha-1 of the organic compost. We concluded plant structural characteristics and water use efficiency were responsive to applications of the organic compost, and we recommend the dose of 67.7 Mg ha-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26505/21133,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic parameters of growth traits in Nellore cattle,"This study evaluated non-genetic factors and calculated heritability estimates of direct and maternal effects for growth traits in Nellore cattle raised in southern Brazil. Performance records of 4170, 1538, 3139, 1830, and 1151 calves born from 2005 to 2011 were analyzed for birth weight (BW), adjusted120-day weight (W120), adjusted 205-day weight (W205), adjusted365-day weight (W365), and adjusted 550-day weight (W550), respectively. The components of (co)variance used to calculate heritability estimates were determined by Derivative-Free Restricted Maximum Likelihood using the MTDFREML software. Contemporary groups were included in the model as fixed effects, and direct and maternal effects, permanent environmental effects, and residual errors were included as random effects. Phenotypic correlations were estimated using the PROC CORR procedure from SAS. Overall means for BW, W120, W205, W365, and W550 were 38, 138, 201, 270, and 376 kg, respectively. Heritability estimates for direct and maternal effects were 0.17 ± 0.04 and 0.11 ± 0.03 (BW), 0.14 ± 0.03 and 0.03 ± 0.04 (W120), and 0.17 ± 0.04 and 0.09 ± 0.03 (W205). Genetic, phenotypic, and environmental correlations were 0.79, 0.44, and 0.32 for BW and W120, 0.79, 0.39, and 0.26 for BW and W205, and 0.96, 0.74, and 0.75 for W120 and W205. The results indicate that selection for pre-weaning weight would be more efficient using W205, and genetic correlation coefficients indicate that selection at any age should produce a positively correlated response at older ages. Genetic, phenotypic, and environmental correlation coefficients between W365 and W550 were 0.99, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively. Selection for adjusted 550-day weight should produce the greatest genetic gains.

This study was conducted from April 24, 2012 to November 7, 2013 in the Western Paraná State University (UNIOESTE), Marechal Cândido Rondon, Brazil. Pastures under one grazing and non-grazing conditions were evaluated under 120 kg N ha-1 fertilization split into two 60 kg N ha-1 treatments. Two pastures received 40 kg N ha-1 three times. IPR 126 oat, BRS Tarumã wheat, and IPR 111 triticale were the test crops. Topdressing with 40 or 60 kg N ha-1 did not change morphological characteristics until 60 d after sowing. Pastures under non-grazing that received 120 kg N ha-1 treatments were taller than the controls, whereas those under grazing that received 80 or 120 kg N ha-1 presented with higher leaf production than did the controls. Total average dry matter (DM) production in 2012 and 2013 was, respectively, 5,275 kg ha-1 and 6,270 kg ha-1 for oat, 3,166 kg ha-1 and 7,423 kg ha-1 for wheat, and 4,552 kg ha-1 and 7,603 kg ha-1 for triticale. Split N fertilization did not cause differences in the levels of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in the forage. Nevertheless, increases in in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were observed in oat and wheat receiving 60 kg N ha-1 during the first graze. IVDMD did not change in oat, wheat, and triticale forages receiving 80 or 120 kg N ha-1 during the second graze. Grazing did not affect the nutritional values of wheat and triticale grains, but reduced those of oat. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that grazing lengthens the crop cycles, and so allow the staggered sowing of summer crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26320/21103,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Tissue damage and embryonic malformation induced by aqueous extract of Pteridium aquilinum on chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo (CAM),"The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of Bracken fern (BF) (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn.) on biological systems. When consumed by animals can cause acute intoxication, hematuria, biochemistry alterations and cancer. To humans the toxicity is associated with its intake on contaminated ground water or milk and inhalation of its spores. In order to check the BF aqueous extract (AEB) deleterious effects on animals blood vessels system, chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was used. It were applying on CAM 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 e 15 µg/mL of AEB and saline as control. The angiogenesis was analyzed and the vascular density index (VDI) calculated. The CAM samples were prepared and stained with H&E to evaluation of microvessels, Masson’s trichrome to characterize collagen and fibrin deposition and Picro-sirius used to evaluate collagen using polarized light. Also the morphological aspects of embryos were analysed. We observe on the results of neovascularization that AEB did not change significantly the number of vessels/mm², however, membranes treated with AEB (5 or 10 µg/mL) exhibit opacity and tissue fibrosis, both signs of inflammation. Histological analysis with Masson's trichrome and picro-sirius on tissues exposed to AEB respectively has shown increased collagen fibers and presence of fibrilar collagen. The embryos exposed to concentrations of 5 or 10 µg/mL AEB, showed changes as poor face formation and poor closing of abdominal wall. The highest concentration of AEB (15 µg/mL) was lethal to embryos. Although significant effects on the CAM’s vasculature has not observed, tissue aggression was detected, a desmoplasia (an extensive inflammatory signal triggered by tissue injury), changes caused on embryos as well as the presence of toxic substances in the AEB show us an important and deleterious pathway of this bracken fern extract on its intoxicants effects on humans and animals, and even cancer or the death of animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26194/21069,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carcass and meat of two genetic groups of cattle fed two levels of grass-Convert silage in feedlot,"Assessment of carcass and meat characteristics of Nellore young bulls or dairy crossbred young bulls fed two levels of grass-Convert silage in the rations (400 and 100 g kg-1 of dry matter). Sixteen Nellore young bulls and 16 dual-purpose dairy young bulls (Holstein x Gir and Holstein x Guzerá) with average initial body weight of 378.8±13.8 kg were used. The experimental design was completely randomized with treatments in a 2x2 factorial arrangement. The proportion of silage and the genetic group did not change the percentage of muscle, fat and bone of the carcass. The yield of the primary commercial cuts was not altered by the level of silage. The pistol cut weight was higher in Nellore young bulls compared to dairy crossbred young bulls (125.8 vs. 119.5 kg), while the relative weight of short ribs was higher in dairy crossbreds (11.9 vs. 11.5%). Only the muscle cut of the pistol was altered by silage proportion in the rations, being higher in those with the lowest proportion of grass silage. On the other hand, only the relative weight of flat, rump cap and edible lean trims were altered by genetic group, which were higher in Nellore young bulls. Among the characteristics of the meat, only marbling was significantly changed, being higher in dairy crossbreds fed rations with a lower grass-silage proportion. The genetic group did not alter the other meat characteristics. Nellore young bulls produce carcasses with higher yield of valuable meat cuts in relation to dairy crossbred young bulls.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26433/21071,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Pearl millet grain for beef cattle in crop-livestock integration system: intake and digestibility,"The present study aimed to evaluate the nutritional parameters (intake and digestibility) of beef cattle in two genetic groups fed protein-energy supplements formulated by different levels of replacement of maize with pearl millet grain during the dry season. Sixty-four uncastrated young bulls, with an average age of 20 months and an initial body weight of 388 ± 26 kg, were included in the study. The experimental area consisted of four paddocks approximately 4.7 ha in size, composed of Brachiaria brizantha ‘Marandu’ within a crop-livestock integration system. The study was based on a completely randomized factorial design (2×4). Two genetic groups (Crossbred and Nellore) and the effects of replacement of maize with pearl millet grain at 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% in the supplement formulations were assessed. No significant effects were observed in the genetic groups and with the replacement of maize with pearl millet grain, as well as in the pasture total dry matter (DM) and nutrients intake, or the coefficients of total digestibility of nutrients. The dietary concentration of digested organic matter was not influenced by the replacement levels of pearl millet grain, with values of 514.88, 515.76, 516.01, and 515.98 g kg-1 of DM recorded for the 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% replacement levels, respectively. Therefore, pearl millet grain can be utilized as a partial or total substitute for maize grain as the energetic ingredient in concentrated supplements for Nellore and crossbred beef cattle in pastures managed in crop-livestock integration systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26316/21070,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of propolis extract on angelfish larval performance and transport,"This study aimed to evaluate the influence propolis extract inclusion to the feed mixture for juvenile angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) on larval performance and transport. Levels of propolis extract inclusion consisted of 0, 300, 600, 900, and 1200 mg.kg-1 of feed. After 14 days of hatching, unmetamorphosed larvae with a total length of 18.4 mm and 0.11 g initial weight were used. Six-hundred larvae were divided into 20 experimental units, totalizing 30 larvae each. Experimental units consisted of polythene containers with independent water input and output and a level controller. Each unit was controlled for maintenance of 40 L water within a recirculation system. After offering feed containing propolis extract, five fish from each experimental unit were packed in bags for transportation only with atmospheric air, without pure oxygen addition. The bags were filled with 300 mL water on a 2:1 basis of air and water respectively. The total transport time was considered until the death of the third fish in package. At the end of the experiment, data underwent statistical analysis through Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 2001). Results showed there was no significant difference (P < 0.05) neither for any of the studied zootechnical variables (standard length, total length, height, and weight) nor for the transport of juveniles. In conclusion, propolis extract addition to angelfish feed was ineffective for larval performance and for transportation of juveniles, at the levels tested here.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26187/21068,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Available phosphorus reduction in weaned piglets’ diets containing phytase combined with butyric and benzoic acids,"This study aimed to evaluate the reduction of available phosphorus (Pa) in the diet of weaned piglets using phytase combined with butyric and benzoic acids. A total of 120 piglets with initial weight of 6.7 ± 0.02 kg were used in a randomized block design with six treatments: control; reduction of 0.15% Pa (Pa red); Phytase + Pa red; Phytase + butyric acid + Pa red; Phytase + benzoic acid + Pa red; Phytase + butyric acid + benzoic acid + Pa red; five replicates, with four animals each. The experimental diets had no influence on the fecal scores, Escherichia coli count, or the pH of the digestive tract. An improved villus:crypt ratio was found when the combination of phytase with butyric and benzoic acids was used. The histomorphometry of the jejunum and of the ileum showed no differences with respect to villus height, crypt depth, and villus:crypt ratio. The bones of the piglets fed with a diet containing reduced levels of available phosphorus showed less resistance to fracture. The levels of calcium in the raw bones were lower in the piglets that received a diet containing phytase and butyric acid. Reduced phosphorus deposition was observed in the bones of animals that received the diet containing phytase, butyric acid, and benzoic acid. It is concluded that the inclusion of phytase and butyric and benzoic acids, and their combination, in the diet of weaned piglets does not affect the pH of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon, and does not change the frequency of diarrhea or the E. Coli count. The association of butyric and benzoic acids with phytase in the diet of piglets after weaning improves the villus:crypt ratio of the duodenum. The use of phytase (1000 UF/kg) allows the formulation of diets for weaned piglets with a 0.15% reduction in the level of available phosphorus without damaging the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the bones and without altering bone resistance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26110/21067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nutritional quality of massai grass fertilized with phosphorus and nitrogen and its influence on intake and weight gain of sheep under rotational grazing on quartzipsamment soil,"The effects of phosphate and nitrogen fertilization on aspects of forage composition and ruminal fermentation were separately evaluated pre- and post-grazing, in addition to the dry matter intake and weight gain of sheep grazing Panicum maximum cv. Massai under a rotational system on Quartzipsamment soil. The aim was to evaluate the effect of fertilization with different levels of phosphorous (50 and 200 kg P2O5/ha) and nitrogen (100 and 400 kg N/ha) compared to unfertilized control soil. The experiment was conducted at the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science at Universidade Federal do Tocantins – UFT, in a randomized complete block design with four replicates in a factorial 2 × 2 design. The study area consisted of 32 paddocks (301 m²), each of which had previously been sown with Panicum maximum cv. Massai. The experimental area was managed under intermittent stocking with a variable stocking rate. Twenty-eight crossbreed sheep were used for grazing management. Evaluations were made before and after grazing, including forage evaluation and measurement of ruminal degradability and intake (using titanium dioxide as the external marker). Regarding the forage composition, a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed between the control and fertilizer treatments for neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber, crude protein, lignin and phosphorous content. Fertilization was found to alter the nutritional quality of Panicum maximum cv. Massai grass. Among the nutritional aspects evaluated, fertilization influenced NDF, grass digestibility and dry matter intake. The forage composition of Massai grass is improved by fertilization with nitrogen at 100 kg N/ha and phosphate up to 50 kg P2O5/ha, which represents a relevant management practice for increasing quantity and quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25796/21112,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,The effect of cancellous bone grafts on time to consolidation at osteotomy site following tibial tuberosity advancement in dogs,"Rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament is the main cause of lameness in dogs. Several surgical techniques are used as a treatment, especially osteotomies, as the tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA). Recently new research are being conducted investigating ways to reduce bone healing time. Cancellous bone grafting is considered to be the gold standard method to speed healing due to its osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cancellous gone grafts on the time taken for consolidation at the osteotomy site in dogs undergoing TTA surgery. TTA surgery was performed in 19 stifles in which there was rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament and a tibial plateau angle less than 27 degrees. The cases were divided into two groups: dogs in the control group (C) had TTA only and for those in the study group (E) TTA was complimented with a cancellous bone graft. Serial radiographs were evaluated at 21 day intervals post-surgery and consolidation was confirmed by visual inspection by three observers (two radiologists and an orthopedic surgeon). There was no difference in consolidation time between Groups C and E. The addition of cancellous bone grafting to the osteotomy did not influence time to consolidation in dogs undergoing TTA surgery.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26262/21116,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of commercially available follicle stimulating hormone on the in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes,"The work aimed (Experiment I) to compare commercial representations of porcine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH, Pluset® vs. Folltropin®) in concentration (10 ?g/mL) and time (24 h) standard (more used in protocols of in vitro maturation, IVM); (Experiment II) to evaluate the best incubation time (6 h vs. 16 h vs. 24 h) and, (Experiment III) analyze varying concentrations (1.0 ?g/mL vs. 2.5 ?g/mL vs. 10.0 ?g/mL) of representations of FSH on the IVM of bovine oocytes. Thus, oocytes were recovered and submitted to IVM under appropriate conditions. After the IVM, oocytes were evaluated for expansion of cumulus cells (CCs), presence of the first polar body (1PB) and metaphase plate (MII). All the data were analyzed by the Fisher exact test (P < 0.05). Initially, in Experiment I, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed in maturation rates of the oocytes incubated with FSH Pluset® or Folltropin®, assessed by expansion of CCs (97.6% vs. 94.3%), presence of 1PB (76.6% vs. 69.4%) and MII (70.0% vs. 68.6%). In Experiment II, when the incubation time with FSH was evaluated, both Pluset® as Folltropin® showed lower rate of expansion of CCs when they were present only in the first 6 h of IVM. As for presence of 1PB, differences were observed in relation to Pluset® while Folltropin® showed similar results in all incubation times. Regarding the MII, no difference was observed between the incubation times with FSH Pluset® and Folltropin®. In Experiment III, no difference was observed in the expansion of CCs, presence of 1PB and MII for concentrations evaluated FSH Pluset® and Folltropin®. Therefore, the FSH Pluset® and Folltropin® have the same efficiency in IVM of bovine oocytes. Regarding the incubation time, it is recommended to maintain FSH (Pluset® or Folltropin®) throughout the period of IVM, since there was no difference in the results of presence of MII. Furthermore, the concentration of 1.0 ?g/mL of FSH Pluset® and Folltropin® is as effective as 10 ?g/mL and can therefore be used for IVM of oocytes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26118/21009,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Comparative analyses of thoracic radiographs and bronchoalveolar lavage of dogs and cats with chronic bronchial diseases,"There is a high incidence of bronchitis and asthma cases in veterinary medicine. Thoracic radiographs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are commonly performed for definitive diagnosis in dogs and cats with suspected bronchitis and asthma. It is believed that a combination of diagnostic tools is the best choice to achieve a diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thoracic radiographs and BAL in the diagnosis of chronic bronchial disease (CBD) in dogs and cats and whether there is any specific radiographic finding that could influence the indication for bronchoalveolar lavage. It was performed a cross-sectional, prospective, observational study including forty client-owned dogs and cats with lower respiratory tract signs and positive radiographic opacities that were evaluated with BAL followed by cytology and culture. The radiographic results compared with BAL culture showed a sensitivity of 38%, specificity of 95% and accuracy of 65% in detecting patients with pneumonia associated with chronic bronchial disease. Thoracic radiographs were effective in diagnosing 65% of the patients, radiographs plus BAL cytology diagnosed 75% of patients and the combination of radiographs, BAL cytology and culture diagnosed 95% of the patients with chronic bronchial disease. In conclusion, the combination of radiographic examination with BAL followed by cytological and microbiological analyses increases diagnostic success in CBD.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26282/21010,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Immunohistochemical and serological aspects of Toxoplasma gondii infection in Neotropical primates,"Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the intracellular coccidian Toxoplasma gondii that infects most warm-blooded vertebrates, is widely distributed and fatal for primates, which are peculiarly susceptible for unknown reason(s). Owing to the increasing number of Neotropical mammal deaths where in T. gondii were detected in analyzed tissues, the present immunohistochemical study analyzed the distribution patterns of immunostainings related to this parasite on primates necropsied at the Laboratório de Patologia Animal of Universidade de Passo Fundo (UPF), between the years of 2000 and 2014. Furthermore, a serological survey for the disease was conducted for 21 primates from the UPF Zoo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, belonging to genera Sapajus and Alouatta. In a immunohistochemical test performed using streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase, 26.53% positivity was detected in 98 primates. Immunostainings revealed that infection differed among the lung (76.92%), liver (58.33%), heart (50%), brain (42.30%), and kidney (23.07%) tissues. Serology performed through indirect hemagglutination showed reactivity in 85.7% of the animals, all belonging to Sapajus sp., while the three primates that did not show reactivity (14.3%) belonged to Alouatta sp.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25982/21007,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of age and cyclical heat stress on the serum biochemical profile of broiler chickens,"This study aimed to evaluate the influence of age and cyclical heat stress for 1 hour per day on the levels of serum proteins, metabolites, and enzymes in broiler chickens of 21-42 days of age. We used 420 male broiler chickens, Cobb Avian48TM breed, in a completely randomized experimental design, composed of two treatments and six replicates. The treatments consisted of two thermal environments: one in which broiler chickens were raised under natural conditions of temperature and humidity for the first 42 days of age (control) and another in which chickens were subjected to heat stress at 36°C, from days 16 to 42, for 1 hour per day (1200-1300 hours). At 21, 28, 35, and 42 days of age, approximately 5 mL of blood was collected by cardiac puncture in two birds per replicate. In each serum sample, levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity and uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and glucose levels were determined. Concerning the environment and the age, no significant differences in the levels of glucose, uric acid, ALT, triglycerides, and very low density lipoproteins were observed. There was a significant interaction between the environment and the age for cholesterol and LDL values. At 21 days of age, cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) were higher in birds under stress than in the control treatment birds, which did not occur in other age groups. Aspartate aminotransferase activity was higher in chickens under cyclical heat stress than in chickens subjected to control treatment and displayed a cubic response regarding the environment. The age of the birds influenced the values of total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio, creatinine, GGT, and HDL. In conclusion, cyclical heat stress, at 36ºC, for one hour, from days 16 to 42 of age increases serum AST, whereas cholesterol and LDL-C levels increase only at day 21, indicating that birds may have adapted to heat stress. Age influenced the activity of AST and GGT and levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin, A:G ratio, cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26009/21008,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,"Toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis, and brucellosis seroepidemiology in veterinary medical students and their relation with unique health","Toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis, and brucellosis are global zoonoses, with humans as accidental participants in their transmission cycles. The can also be considered occupational diseases, because certain professionals are at greater risk of contact and infection by such zoonoses. These three diseases have different epidemiological characteristics because of the distinct environmental, social, cultural, and economic conditions where these pathogens circulate. Because of the importance of these diseases and their associations with specific occupations, we performed a seroepidemiological survey of Toxoplasma, Leptospira, and Brucella antibodies, with an analysis of the association between positive serum and certain occupational and environmental variables, in students of a veterinary medicine course (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th year) in a university in the northwestern region in the state of Paraná, Brazil. From May to November 2014, blood samples were collected from 157 volunteers by professionals trained in nursing and biomedicine from the same university as the veterinary students. At the time of blood collection, the students did not present any clinical signs of the three diseases of interest. To detect anti-Toxoplasma gondii, anti-Leptospira spp., and anti-Brucella antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence test (IIF), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), fast agglutination test (a screening test), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed. To determine variables associated with these infections, the students were interviewed to complete an epidemiological questionnaire with environmental, behavioral, and occupational information. The associations between these variables and infections were assess by chi-square or Fischer's exact tests, with a 5% significance level (?). Of the 157 serum samples analyzed, 29.29% reacted to Toxoplasma antigens, with titers ranging from 16 to 4096 by IIF, 1.27% to Leptospira antigens, with titers ranging from 100 to 800 by MAT using Hardjo and Wolffi serovars, and 0.63% to Brucella antigens by ELISA; however, no variables were found to be associated with infection with any of these pathogens. The results of this study show that one-third of the students in the veterinary medicine course were exposed to Toxoplasma gondii, Leptospira spp., and Brucella spp. at some stage in their lives; however, it is not possible to determine whether these infections were acquired at the university, because no associations between occupational risk variables and these infections were found. An understanding of the transmission of each etiological agent and methods to prevent infection is important to maintain low prevalence levels of these zoonotic diseases during the veterinary medicine course and extra-curricular internships, when there is increased exposure to these pathogens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25899/21005,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Prevalence of equine infectious anemia in stud farms in Minas Gerais, Brazil","Horse breeding is expanding in Brazil. Nevertheless, equine infectious anemia (EIA) a transmissible, incurable disease is an obstacle to the development of the horse industry. Therefore, to determine the incidence of EIA at stud farms in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, a serological survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence and identify potential risk factors for equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) transmission. This was the second stage of an ongoing study on the epidemiology of the disease, which was first observed in draft horses. A sample of 7,742 equids from 717 stud farms in seven regions within the State was tested between May 2004 and January 2006. Laboratory tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and agar gel immunodiffusion were conducted for screening and confirmation, respectively. The prevalence of EIA was estimated to be 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.00-0.871) at the farm level and 0.07% (95% CI=0.00-0.251) at the animal level. The low prevalence of EIA in stud farms might be explained by the higher zootechnical value of stable-bred animals, which leads to periodical serological control and compliance with the slaughter of test-positive animals in order to keep the farm EIA-free. Moreover, stable-bred horses usually travel more and are subjected to more official controls than are draft horses. The highest prevalence of EIA was observed in regions 1 (North/Northwest of Minas Gerais) and 2 (Vale do Mucuri/Jequitinhonha), with rates of 0.34% and 0.72%, respectively. These results show that the prevalence of EIA at stud farms in Minas Gerais is generally low, with the prevalence being higher in the northern part of the State (regions 1 and 2). A previous serological survey on EIA among draft horses showed a very similar distribution of EIA infection in Minas Gerais. These results suggest a very similar pattern of EIA distribution across the State and irrespective of zootechnical value, but the northern/northwestern regions have a higher prevalence than do the southern regions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23982/21041,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Evaluation of animal performance, feed intake, and economic losses in sheep experimentally infected with Trypanosoma vivax","Trypanosoma vivax is a protozoan originating from the African continent, which, although it has not yet been able to complete its biological cycle in South America, due to the absence of the tsetse fly, can still cause death in ruminants. The objective of this study was to verify the effects of T. vivax on the measurements and indices in sheep that characterize animal performance, as well as on economic losses in meat animals. Twenty intact adult male sheep were used for this study, all of approximately the same ages and weights, reared in confinement, and subjected to the same management and diet, which was balanced and supplemented with adequate minerals. The animals were divided into two groups: the control group (CG) and the infected group (IG), which was inoculated intravenously with 1.3 x 105 trypomastigotes of T. vivax. Feed intake was verified daily, whereas the feed conversion (FC), feed efficiency index (FEI), and weight gain were obtained weekly. Total weight gain (TWG) was determined after 70 days post-infection. The economic loss was calculated by subtracting the value obtained (IG) from the expected value (CG), and the difference was expressed as a percentage. A randomized block design was used to isolate the effect of the initial weight. The means were compared by the Student “t” test at 5%. Of the 10 infected animals, one died from the parasitism, yielding a rate much lower than that observed in natural outbreaks. The groups presented similar feed intakes throughout the experimental period; however, the TWG of the infected group was significantly lower (50.7%) than that of the CG. Similarly, the daily weight gain (DWG), feed conversion (FC), and feed efficiency index (FEI) of the IG were significantly lower than those of the CG. In addition, the worst rates of FC and FEI coincided with parasitemia peaks and recurrences, probably due to immunological demand and tissue repair. The abdominal circumference of the infected animals was statistically lower than that of the CG, which may be directly related to fat mobilization, in addition to the possible negative effect on the digestive capacity. The economic losses due to weight alone were 24.07% and could reach 31.66% of the herd value due to animal death. Infection with T. vivax negatively affected animal performance indices, even when the animals were well nourished. Trypanosoma vivax in sheep destined for slaughter caused economic losses of 31.66% due to the decrease in performance and the death rate in the infected group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23534/21003,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,One-step laparoscopy for the correction of left abomasal displacement in high-yielding Holstein dairy cows,"Surgical procedures for the correction of abomasal displacement are one of the most frequently performed in dairy cows, and many surgical techniques have been described since the first cases of this disease were reported in the 1950s. Although no report to date has described the use of one-step laparoscopy in Brazil, the technique has several advantages over the traditional techniques, e.g., better abdominal visualization and minor trauma resulting from the minimally invasive technique. Accordingly, one-step laparoscopy, as described by Christiansen and Barisani, was performed to treat left abomasal displacement in 21 high-yielding dairy cows from two dairy regions of Paraná State. The technique was performed without complications in 12/21 (57.14%) cows. Ruminal (four animals), abomasal (two animals), both ruminal and abomasal (one animal), and splenic (one animal) perforations occurred during surgery but without any postoperative complication. One cow developed pyloric obstruction caused by the toggle bar suture, but early removal restored abomasal flux. Three animals died of different causes. One cow showed recurrence of displacement 1 month after surgery. A third access was necessary in cows that weighed more than 700 kg. One-step laparoscopy is an efficient, fast, and safe technique for the correction of left abomasal displacement.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23276/21002,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of cooking methods on bioactive compounds in beetroot,"Beetroot is rich in bioactive compounds that may provide health benefits. However, vegetable tissues are physically and chemically damaged by cooking, causing major changes to compounds in cell membranes. The current study aimed to evaluate the influence of several cooking methods on bioactive compounds in beetroot. Four heat treatments were carried out: steam cooking, pressure cooking, baking in an oven, and boiling in water. Beets were matched in uniformity of size, color, and absence of defects. They were washed thoroughly in running water to remove dirt. Next, one of the four cooking methods was applied. After cooking, beets were peeled by hand. Analysis was carried out on both uncooked and cooked beets to evaluate antioxidant activity, content of phenolic compounds, pigments, flavonoids, and betalains. The experiment was completely randomized design (CRD) and carried out in triplicate. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (F test, p < 0.05) and mean values compared by Tukey test at 5% probability. There was no change in antioxidant activity or total phenolic and anthocyanin content by any of the cooking methods compared to that in raw beetroots. However, pressure-cooking resulted in lower carotenoid levels compared to that in raw beet. Furthermore, flavonoid and betalain content decreased by all the cooking methods.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26355/21044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Blanching effect on the bioactive compounds and on the viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG before and after in vitro simulation of the digestive system in jabuticaba juice,"The viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in jabuticaba juices and its survival in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), simulated in vitro, was studied. Two juices were prepared: A - with non-blanched fruits, and B - with blanched fruits. LGG was then added and the juices maintained at 8 ºC for 28 days. The control treatment consisted of juices without the added probiotic. The following were determined in the juices: the viability and in vitro survival of LGG, fecal coliforms, Salmonella sp., pH, acidity, total soluble solids (TSS), color, antioxidant capacity, total phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and ascorbic acid. The sensory acceptability was also determined using a 9-point hedonic scale. Blanching interfered (p < 0.05) with the viability of LGG, juice A showing the greatest viability as compared to juice B. After in vitro simulation, the probiotic bacterial count was < 1.0 log CFU mL-1, which demonstrates the low resistance of the strain to the simulated GIT conditions. The juices were conformed to the microbiological standards established by law. The pH, acidity and TSS were influenced by blanching (p < 0.05), with values of 5.03, 0.46% and 15.38 °Brix for juice A and 5.12, 0.66% and 16.05 °Brix for juice B, respectively. The addition of LGG did not influence these characteristics. Only the pH value was influenced by the storage time (p < 0.05), increasing throughout storage. Juice B showed lower luminosity (L*) and a greater value for a* as compared to juice A, indicating that the former became darker and redder due to the blanching process. Both juices showed positive values for the b* coordinate. The juice was found to be a good source of polyphenols. Neither the time nor the addition of LGG affected the antioxidant capacity, total phenolic compounds or anthocyanin contents. However, blanching contributed (p < 0.05) to an increase in the contents of these compounds in the juices. Values for antioxidant capacity of 186.20 and 2552.59 uM Trolox g-1, for total phenolic compounds of 275.06 and 1163.18 mg GAE 100 g-1-wwb, and for anthocyanins as cyanidin 3-glucoside of 12.71 and 90.99 mg 100 g-1 were found for juices A and B, respectively. The juices contained 72.87 mg 100 mL-1 of ascorbic acid. Scores of above 6.0 (liked slightly) were awarded on the hedonic scale for the attributes evaluated. The addition of probiotics in jabuticaba juices needs to be further studied to ensure the viability of the cultures during storage and their survival in the gastrointestinal tract.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26307/21000,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Preoperative epidural administration of lidocaine-methadone or lidocaine-fentanyl in female dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy,"We compared the analgesia and cardiopulmonary changes induced by epidural methadone or fentanyl in combination with lidocaine in female dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy and anesthetized with propofol. Eighteen female dogs were randomly assigned to two groups and given either methadone (0.3 mg kg?¹) + 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor (LM) or fentanyl (5 µg kg?¹) + 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor (LF). The drugs were administered epidurally in a volume of 0.25 ml kg?¹. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and blood glucose levels were recorded before and 15 minutes after premedication (T0 and T1); 15 minutes after epidural administration (T2); five minutes after dermotomy (T3); five minutes after clamping of the ovarian pedicle (T4); five minutes and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours (T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, and T11, respectively) after surgery. The number of additional propofol injections and total propofol dose (mg kg?¹) were recorded. Analgesia was assessed using a numerical descriptive scale. SBP and HR were similar in both groups, but hypotension was detected in animals from both groups at different times. Respiratory rate decreased significantly at T6 in the LF group and was lower than in the LM group. Hypothermia was observed in animals from both groups, but RT was significantly lower than baseline values only at T4 in the LM group. Blood glucose levels increased significantly only in the LF group at T4, T7, and T8. All animals in the LF group and eight animals in the LM group required additional propofol injections at T4, but no significant differences were detected in the number of propofol injections and total propofol dose between the LF (3 ± 1 injections, 7.5 ± 4.5 mg kg?¹) and LM (2 ± 2 injections, 4.5 ± 3.4 mg kg?¹) groups. The latency period, anesthetic period, and the duration of surgery were similar in both groups. No animals required rescue analgesia. The lidocaine-methadone and lidocaine-fentanyl combinations caused minimal cardiorespiratory changes, but did not abolish pain at the time of handling of the ovarian pedicle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22084/21001,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Critical points and magnitude of impacts on the packing line: effect on ripening and quality of 'Packham's Triumph' pears,"Pears have a very sensitive epidermis and are prone to signal mechanical blemishes, which result in reduced visual quality and low consumer acceptance. The objective of this work was to identify critical points and the magnitude of impact forces on a packing line at a commercial packinghouse. The effect of injuries on ripening and quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears was also evaluated after cold storage. The packing line was scrutinized on its transfer points, fruit drop heights and cushioning overlays, which allowed to acquire the maximum accelerations on each spot. The maximum acceleration forces were reproduced in the lab with ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears to evaluate the effects on fruit quality after cold storage. Four critical points were noticed on the packing line: at the transfer from the conveyor belt to the lifting rollers, at the transfer from the lifting rollers to the washing ramp with rotatory brushes, at the entrance to the singulator at the end of the conveyor belt and at the drop from the sizer to the packing stalls. Ripening of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears invariably came about during cold storage, and independently of the imposed impacts. The impacts under the circumstances of the test did not affect the quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears kept for up to 120 days at cold storage followed by five days at room temperature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25556/21111,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Biological control of bacterial spot of tomato by saprobe fungi from semi-arid areas of northeastern Brazil,"Bacterial spot of tomato, caused by Xanthomonas spp., is a common disease in tomato fields that causes significant economic losses. Due to the difficulty with control of bacterial spot by conventional methods, new techniques such as biological control and induction of resistance are gaining prominence. This study aimed to select saprobe fungi from semi-arid regions of the Brazilian Northeast for the biological control of bacterial spot of tomato. To select the best isolates to control bacterial spot, a greenhouse experiment was initially conducted. Tomato plants (‘Santa Cruz Kada’) were treated with filtrates of 25 saprobe fungi and inoculated three days later with Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. Filtrates of Memnoniella levispora, Periconia hispidula, Zygosporium echinosporum, and Chloridium virescens var. virescens were selected as the most effective. Filtrates and volatile compounds from these four isolates were tested for their antibacterial activity in cultures of X. euvesicatoria and in tomato plants (‘Santa Cruz Kada’) inoculated with X. euvesicatoria. In vitro, the addition of nonvolatile fungal metabolites into the culture medium at 5% and 50% (v/v) inhibited bacterial growth by 28.9% and 53.8%, respectively. The volatile compounds produced by C. virescens var. virescens reduced the number of colony-forming units of X. euvesicatoria by 25.9%. In vivo, all treatments reduced from 62.4 to 71.3% the area under bacterial spot progress curve, showing the same control efficacy as the commercial resistance inducer used as a positive control (acibenzolar-S-methyl). Systemicity of the fungal filtrates was confirmed in a separate experiment, where application of the treatments exclusively to the third leaf decreased the severity of the disease on the fourth leaf (except for C. virescens var. virescens). These results show that M. levispora, P. hispidula, Z. echinosporum, and C. virescens var. virescens are potential biocontrol agents against bacterial spot of tomato. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the disease control mechanisms of saprobe fungi.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26413/21104,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Genetic, environmental and genotype x environment interaction effects on the common bean grain yield and commercial quality","The objective of this study was to assess the effects of environmental and genotype x environment (GxE) interaction on the commercial quality and grain yield of common bean for the identification of new cultivars for the South Central and Central regions of Brazil, that combine high adaptability/stability for grain yield, sieve yield (SY) and 100-seed weight (100M). Sixty-two trials were performed in a randomised block design with three replicates in different sowing seasons in the South Central (Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS)) and Central (Goiás (GO) and Distrito Federal (DF)) regions in 2009 and 2010. In the trials, 16 “carioca”-seeded lines were evaluated, and grain yield, SY and 100M were collected. The data were then subjected to individual and joint analyses of variance and to adaptability and stability analyses using the Annichiarico method. Genetic variation was found between the lines for all three traits. Coefficient of determination estimates showed that the genotype effect was more important for commercial quality than for grain yield and that the environmental effect was equally important for all three traits, indicating that the highest possible number of environments should be tested. The highest-yielding lines in the Brazilian Central (CNFC 11954 and CNFC 11959) and South Central (CNFC 11948) regions were different, indicating the importance of GxE interactions for yield. However, the two best lines in the Central Region had low commercial grain quality. Thus, CNFC 11948 will be recommended as the new cultivar selected for broad adaptation because it combines high commercial quality with increased mean grain yield and stability in the South Central Region and better yield and stability than the main controls in the Central Region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26106/20997,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Banana fertigation with treated sanitary wastewater: postharvest and microbiological quality,"Sewage may serve as a source of water and nutrients for plants. In this study, the effects of fertigation with treated sanitary wastewater from Janaúba Sewage Treatment Plant were evaluated on the postharvest and microbiological quality of ‘Prata-Anã’ banana. A randomized block experimental design was used. Four concentrations of wastewater were tested (70, 130, 170, and 200% of 150 kg ha-1 sodium). A wastewater-free control treatment was used for comparison. Two crop cycles were assessed for postharvest and microbiological quality. The parameters measured included total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio, pH, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms on both the peel and the pulp. In the first crop cycle, both soluble solids and fruit pulp pH decreased as wastewater level increased up to a maximum of 141.5%. These correlations were not observed in the second cycle. Wastewater management did not affect the titratable acidity of the soluble solids. The agricultural application of treated sanitary wastewater provided banana fruits with a microbiological profile similar to that obtained with the control (pure water) and with mineral fertilizers. A microbial balance is necessary to maintain the nutritional status of the banana crop.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26068/20996,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Agronomic performance of the Maciel peach with different rootstocks,"The rootstock influences the agronomic performance of fruit plants. In Prunus persica (peach), particularly those varieties produced in Brazil, this relationship is not well understood. We, therefore, set out to evaluate the performance of the peach cultivar Maciel with eight rootstocks, Aldrighi, Capdeboscq, Flordaguard, Nemaguard, Okinawa, Umezeiro, Tsukuba, and Seleção Viamão, planted in 2006 and evaluated in the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 seasons. Phenology of flowering, trunk diameter, canopy volume, fruit number, and yield were evaluated in the field. For the fruit, we evaluated the mass, diameter, color, flesh firmness, soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity, concentration of total phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity. Plants from the Aldrighi and Nemaguard rootstocks flowered earlier than plants from the other rootstocks in 2014, and in 2015, flowering was variable in all rootstocks. The cultivar Maciel on Umezeiro had low vigor, trunk diameter, and canopy volume. On Aldrighi, Capdeboscq, Flordaguard, Nemaguard, and Tsukuba this cultivar showed good production rates. The fruit color, flesh firmness, concentration of soluble solids, total phenolics, antioxidant activity, and total carotenoids were influenced by rootstock and harvest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25972/20995,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Prospecting for sludge bacteria from a poultry slaughterhouse, with potential for degrading organic substances","The sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants of slaughterhouses is a rich source of chemical, organic, and microbiological constituents that can be biotechnologically exploited. The purpose of this study was to (i) conduct a chemical analysis of the sludge, and (ii) isolate, quantify, and describe the amylolytic, cellulolytic, ligninolytic, proteolytic, and keratinolytic bacteria in the sludge. Sludge samples were collected at the wastewater treatment plant of the Francap SA poultry company. The nutrient contents, C/N ratio, and pH were determined. For the bacterial count, 10 g sludge was diluted in 90 mL saline solution, which was serially diluted to 10-12. Aliquots of 100 µL of each dilution were transferred to selective media for isolation of bacteria that degrade organic substances. The colony-forming units were determined for each culture medium. Individual colonies were purified and characterized morphologically. The sludge contained 9.5, 1.21, and 0.45 dag kg-1 of N, P, and K, respectively. Fifty-two isolates were purified and characterized, with 2.11 × 1012 to 9.55 ×1015 colony-forming units per g sludge. In conclusion, the sludge generated in poultry slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plants is a rich source of organo-mineral constituents and bacteria with biotechnological potential for degrading organic substances.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25953/20994,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Selectivity of the herbicide linuron sprayed in pre-emergence and post-early in carrot,"Herbicide application is a method for weed control in carrot crops. However, the choice of the chemical treatment (herbicide, association of products, dose, and time of application) should consider its selectivity to the crop. It is desired to analyze the selectivity of linuron for carrot plants, when sprayed on pre-emergence and post-early cultivated plants. Two experiments were carried out in the field in an area of the commercial production of carrots, one with the Verano cultivar and the other with BRS Planalto. Both experiments included an experimental design with randomized blocks in a factorial 2 x 4 + 1 with six and four replications for the experiments with Verano and BRS Planalto, respectively. The herbicide linuron (675 and 990 g a.i. ha-1) was sprayed at four times, counting from the carrot sowing day: in the pre-emergence of the crop at 0, 3, and 6 days after sowing (DAS) and in the post-early emergence at 9 DAS, when the plants had 1 or 2 cotyledons. An untreated control was maintained as an additional treatment. Linuron was selective for the carrot plant cultivars Verano and BRS Planalto, in both doses tested, when sprayed in the pre-emergence, up to six days after sowing, and in the post-early (plants with 1 or 2 cotyledon leaves) at nine days after sowing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25907/20993,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of the sowing depth and amount of sugarcane straw on the emergence of Chloris polydactyla and Eleusine indica and their control by herbicides applied pre-emergence,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the sowing depth and amount of sugarcane straw on the soil on the emergence of Chloris polydactyla (‘capim-branco’) and Eleusine indica (Indian goosegrass) and to determine the efficacy of herbicides applied pre-emergence in the control of these species under different straw amount and rainfall regime conditions. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications. In the first experiment, the effects of six sowing depths (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 cm) and six sugarcane straw amounts (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha -1) were assessed on the emergence of Indian goosegrass and ‘capim-branco’ in a 6 x 6 factorial arrangement. In the second experiment, the efficacy in the control of these species was evaluated for one control without herbicide and five treatments (indaziflam, metribuzin, tebuthiuron, indaziflam + metribuzin, and indaziflam + tebuthiuron) applied pre-emergence over four straw amounts (0, 1, 2, and 4 t ha-1) in a 6 x 4 factorial arrangement. This experiment was evaluated under two rainfall regimes in separate experiments (simulation of 20 mm of rainfall 1 or 10 days after herbicide application). The ‘capim-branco’ showed a marked reduction in emergence beginning at 2 t ha-1 of straw and a 2 cm sowing depth. For the Indian goosegrass, the decline in emergence mainly occurred beginning at 4 t ha-1 of straw and a 4 cm sowing depth. Only some of the Indian goosegrass plants emerged at the greater sowing depths (8 and 10 cm) and straw amounts (8 and 10 t ha-1), whereas no emergence of the ‘capim-branco’ was observed under these conditions. The treatments with sowing at a 1 cm depth and with 0, 1, 2, and 4 t ha-1 of straw provided the highest emergence percentage for the species. Application of the herbicide indaziflam alone was the only ineffective treatment for the control of the weeds regardless of the amount of straw and the water regime used. We concluded that the increase in the sowing depth and the amount of straw significantly reduced the emergence of the species and that the presence of straw and the dry period interfered with the herbicide efficacy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25892/20992,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Hydration curve and physiological quality of maize seeds subjected to water deficit,"The hydration pattern associated with the physiological quality of seeds can be an early indicator for the evaluation of seed quality. The present study aimed to evaluate the hydration pattern of seeds subjected, or not, to water restriction, and to relate these patterns to their physiological quality. The physiological quality of seeds from five maize strains (L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) and four hybrids (HT1, HT2, HS1, and HS2) was initially determined using seed germination and vigor tests (accelerated ageing and electric conductivity). A completely randomized experimental design was used with four repeats for the physiological analyses and a regression analysis was performed in order to assess the behavior of the seeds over time. The hydration curve was determined by imbibing the seeds in distilled water (0.0 control) and in a -0.9-MPa osmotic solution of polyethylene glycol 6000. Water uptake by the seeds was found to follow a triphasic pattern in the absence of water stress (0.0 MPa); however, when exposed to a -0.9- MPa osmotic potential, an extended phase II was observed. Diversity was observed between the strains in terms of the hydration pattern of the seeds, which can influence the physiological quality of the hybrid seeds. Regarding the hybrids, a positive relationship was observed between the shortest time to root protrusion and the quality of the seeds, both with or without water restriction, which allows us to conclude that hydration pattern can be used as a parameter for the early evaluation of physiological quality in hybrid maize seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25827/20991,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of variable-row-spacing harvesting picker platform scraping plates on cotton fiber quality and quantity,"There have been increasing demands for high-quality cotton fibers that meet the textile industry quality standards. Concurrently, there have been efforts to reduce contaminants during harvesting to reduce harvesting costs. The goal of this research was to evaluate the efficiency of the picker platform with Variable-Row-Spacing (VRS) for harvesting cotton in narrow rows, over two harvest seasons in two regions within the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. In this study, how the presence vs. absence of scraping plates and variations in travel speed was related to quantifiable levels of impurities the harvested fibers was examined. The research was divided into three experiments (Exp. I, II, and III), using cotton varieties FM 975 WS, IMA 5672 B2 RF, and IMA 5675 B2 RF, with row spacing of 0.45 m. The experimental design was randomized blocks, in a 2 ? 3 factorial design, using the presence/absence of the plate and three speeds (0.61, 1.0, and 1.42 m·s-¹), with seven repetitions, totaling 42 experimental plots. The plot size was 108 m² (3.6 ? 30 m). The data were analyzed using the F test in ANOVA and the post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0.05). The results showed that scraping plates increased the number of stems and cones, and reduced the harvest efficiency of cotton planted in narrow rows in the region of Sorriso-MT during the 2013/2014 harvest. For the 2014/2015 harvest, the highest speed and the presence of the scraping plates increased the number of cones in the cotton samples. In the experiment conducted in Serra da Petrovina, the removal of the scraping plates decreased the amount of cones in the harvested cotton.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25802/20989,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Germination and vigor of linseed seeds under different conditions of light, temperature and water stress","Linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), cultivated from seeds, is one of the oldest plants domesticated by humans and is popularly used as a medicine. It can be used as the raw material to produce oil and bran because it has high lipids content, fiber and proteins. Based on the economic potential of this species and the need for more information about its physiology, the goal of this study was to analyze the effects of light, temperature and water stress on the germination and vigor of linseed seeds. In experiment I the seeds were sown on paper at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25 and 30 ºC in the presence and absence of light. In experiment II, the seeds were placed on paper germitest soaked in solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) at osmotic potentials corresponding to zero, -0.10, -0.20, -0.30, -0.40, -0.50 and -0.60 MPa. To evaluate the physiological potential, the following tests were made: germination, first germination count, length and dry mass of seedlings, and water stress. It was found that the highest percentages of germination and vigor occurred at a constant temperature of 20 °C, both in the presence and absence of light. The reduction of the osmotic potential of the substrate promoted a significant decrease in the germination and vigor of the linseed seeds. Osmotic potentials equal or less than -0.30 MPa were harmful to germination and there was no normal seedling development starting at -0.50 MPa.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25781/20988,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Land use and land cover mapping and identification of misuse in the permanent preservation areas in the Tailândia Municipality - PA,"The objective of this study is to expand the mapping of land use and land cover, as well as of the permanent preservation areas (PPAs), and identify land misuse areas in the PPAs in the Tailândia municipality in the state of Pará, which is part of the Amazon biome. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to achieve these goals. Mapping and classification for the year 2012 were made by visual interpretation of images obtained from the RapidEye satellite, which has a 5 m spatial resolution. In this work, we identified nine classes of land use and land cover. From the hydrography vectors it was possible to determinate the Permanent Preservation Areas of the bodies of water according to the environmental legislation. Analysis of misuse in the PPAs was made by crossing-checking the land use and land cover data with that of the PPAs. The results show that 53 % of the municipality (2,347.64 km²) is occupied by human activities. Livestock farming is the activity that has most increased the use of area (30 %), followed by altered vegetation (14.6 %) and palm oil (7.2 %). The PPAs have a high percentage of misuse (47.12 %), with livestock being the largest contributor, occupying 26.65 % of the PPAs, followed by altered vegetation (12.64 %) and palm oil (4.29 %). Therefore, the main objective in Tailândia is to reconcile economic activity with sustainable development. It is important to emphasize the partnerships between the government, research institutions, regulatory agencies, states departments and local communities, else it would be impossible to monitor or control an area as vast as the Amazon.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25738/21110,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carbon dioxide quantified by the infrared in respiratory activity evaluation in corn seeds,"The respiratory activity is one of the first biological manifestations of vigor loss and detecting it can help the monitoring and quality control of seed production by seed industries. This research aimed to develop and validate the methodology of the carbon dioxide concentration in the evaluation of physiological quality of Zea mays (L.) seeds. The proposed method is grounded on the measurement of the CO2 content by infrared through a drag system and exhaustion of the gas released by the seed maintained in a closed system up to the detection chamber of the gas meter. Samples of 15, 20 and 25 seeds of 6 lots of cultivar CD 384 Hx were incubated at temperatures of 15, 25 and 40 °C. The CO2 content released after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h of incubation were quantified. In parallel, the percentage of normal seedlings emerged in the field were evaluated. The simple correlation coefficients among tests were calculated. After determining the reading conditions, the accuracy and precision of the proposed method were evaluated, using 15 seed lots. For the evaluation of the respiratory activity in Z. mays seeds, we recommend a sample of 25 seeds, incubated at 15 °C for a maximum of 12 h, which allows to classify lots with different levels of vigor and predict the establishment of seedlings in the field, being the appropriate method for measuring CO2 as it externalizes precision between successive measurements and agreement to the reference method.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24484/20985,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Does competition between soybeans and Wild Poinsettia with low-level resistance or susceptibility to glyphosate affect physiology and secondary metabolism?,"The Wild Poinsettia (Euphorbia heterophylla L.) has elevated potential to reduce the soybean yield and is a difficult to control plant due to herbicide resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine the changes in the photosynthetic physiological parameters, secondary metabolite levels, cellular damage, and antioxidant system activity in soybean plants and Wild Poinsettia biotypes with a low level of resistance or susceptibility to glyphosate in competition with soybeans. Two replacement series experiments were conducted in a greenhouse under competition between soybeans and the low-level resistant biotype (experiment I) or susceptible biotype (experiment II). The treatments consisted of different proportions of soybean plants and Wild Poinsettia [100:0 (pure stand of soybean), 50:50, and 0:100 (pure stand of Wild Poinsettia)] and different evaluation periods (the 2013/14 and 2014/15 growing seasons). The following parameters were analyzed: the chlorophyll, carotenoid (CRT), total phenol, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and lipid peroxidation levels and the catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity. Generally, competition between the soybeans and the Wild Poinsettia biotypes did not alter the photosynthetic parameters or the photosynthetic pigment levels of the crop. For the weed biotypes, competition with the soybeans negatively affected photosynthesis. Greater losses of chlorophylls and CRTs were observed for the susceptible biotype when in competition with soybeans, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the biotype with a low level of resistance. No cellular damage or alterations in antioxidant system enzyme activity was observed, which indicated a lack of oxidative stress.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25314/20986,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nephroblastoma with lymphatic metastasis in an Angus calf: scientific communication,"Nephroblastoma is a congenital renal neoplasm composed of metanephric blastema and stromal cells. A one-year-old male Angus calf presented with diarrhea, nasal discharge, cough and weight loss. Serum levels of creatinine and urea were increased, with reduction in the level of albumin. After eight days, clinical condition got worse and the calf died. On necropsy, the cranial pole of the left kidney presented a firm whitish mass (30 x 21 x 14 cm). Multifocal to coalescing firm whitish nodules were observed on the serosa of the large intestine, in the mesentery and in the adventitia of the urinary bladder. All lung lobes contained multifocal to coalescing firm whitish elevated nodules (0.5 to 1 cm of diameter). Histologically, renal mass consisted of neoplastic proliferation of embryonal epithelial and mesenchymal cells, intermixed with large amounts of blastema cells. The nodules on large intestine, mesentery, urinary bladder and lungs were composed mainly of blastema cells and mild amount of mesenchymal cells. Blastema cells were also observed within lymphatic vessels in lung parenchyma. Embryonal epithelial, mesenchymal and blastema cells showed, respectively, positive immunostain for cytokeratin, vimentin and S100. Based on pathological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was diagnosed as nephroblastoma in a calf with metastasis through lymphatic vessels to lungs, large intestine, mesentery and urinary bladder.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24823/20672,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome in a rottweiler: a case report,"Eosinophils are cells of the immune system that have several important functions including phagocytosis of microorganisms, antigen presentation, contribution to chronic inflammation, and immunity against parasites. The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disease in humans that is characterized by persistent eosinophilia (over six months) and variable eosinophil infiltration in organs such as the lungs, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. Once in the tissues, these cells can cause damage by various mechanisms such as release of cytotoxic oxygen free radical and proteins. No etiology has yet been established for HES. The clinical signs vary and relate to the organs involved. In veterinary medicine, the disease has been described in cats, but rarely in dogs, with Rottweilers apparently more predisposed to developing the disease. Owing to the small number of cases reported in the veterinary literature, the prognosis of this disease and the most appropriate treatment options are unclear. Although it can be fatal in animals showing severe clinical symptoms, spontaneous remission may also occur. This study reports a case of HES in a Rottweiler in which the predominant clinical sign was abdominal effusion. We discuss the clinical and laboratory aspects of the disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21259/20611,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of temperature and photoperiod on the germination of Senegalia bahiensis seeds,"Senegalia bahiensis (Fabaceae family, Mimosoideae subfamily) is typical of an anthropic environment, and thus tolerates high levels of disturbance, which supports its use in restoration planting. However, widespread use and marketing of S. bahiensis seeds requires seed quality control, for which there is a dearth of protocols. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and photoperiod on the germination of Senegalia bahiensis seeds from different matrix trees. Seeds were collected from fruits of 15 matrix trees in the municipality of Castro Alves, Bahia, Brazil. Two assays were performed, one for each parameter tested. The experimental design of both assays was completely randomized in a factorial design, and included three replicates of 25 seeds. The design of the first assay was 15 (matrix trees) × 3 (conditions - 25°C, 30°C and alternating temperatures between 25 and 30°C) and the design of the second assay was 14 (matrix trees) × 3 (conditions - 8 or 12 hours of light, or continuous light). The percentage of germination of normal seedlings, germination speed index, mean root length based on total seed number, shoot length, root length and total length were determined. The Tukey's test was used to compare mean values. The S. bahiensis matrix trees used in this study have different requirements in terms of temperature and photoperiod for seed germination. According to our findings, combining a temperature of 30°C and an 8 h period of light conveys the most suitable conditions to conduct germination tests for most matrix trees.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23181/20984,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Detection of anti-Leptospira antibodies in domestic captive primates from Acre, Brazil","Because the Wild Animals Screening Center (CETAS) focuses intensely on restoration and maintenance of primate health and diversity in the Amazon region, detection of potential threats to animal health is crucial. In this view, neglected infections such as leptospirosis are of particular interest. In this report, we have studied the seroreactivity of anti-Leptospira antibodies from primate blood samples collected at CETAS between September 2011 and September 2012. Of the 14 animals investigated by the microscopic agglutination test using live antigens, five (35.7%) were reactive against serovars Celledoni (1), Hebdomadis (1), Icterohaemorrhagiae (2), and Sejroe (1). The results indicate that it is important to identify the contact of these animals with possible pathogens in order to ensure reintroduction of healthy animals into the wild and further understand the disease epidemiology in animals under captivity, gathering, and voluntary surrender of domestic captivity in Acre, Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23558/20600,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Occurrence of Leishmania chagasi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia canis vogeli, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis in canine blood donors","The transfusion of blood components is common in a veterinary clinic; however, the safety of this therapeutic measure cannot always be guaranteed. Studies show a high risk of haemoparasite transmission during blood transfusion in canines. These parasites include Leishmania chagasi, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis, which are endemic to the city of Cuiabá. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of L. chagasi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia (canis) vogeli, A. platys, and E. canis in canine blood donor candidates, and identify possible factors associated with the infection of these agents. Sixty-six canines were evaluated using serologic and molecular tests, for the presence of the Leishmania species. While one canine sample showed a positive result for L. chagasi with indirect fluorescent antibody test, with titer of 1:40, and seven canine samples were positive using DPP, all other samples were negative when using PCR and ELISA. All canines were negative for T. cruzi when using PCR. The B. (c.) vogeli infection was identified in one canine and A. platys was identified in six canines. E. canis was identified in 17 canines, with a prevalence of 25.7%. There were no significant factors associated with the infection of the pathogens investigated. Given the observation of infection, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, emphasis must be placed on the need for the use of more sensitive and specific diagnostic methods for the screening of donor canines.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23499/20671,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,A report of the Maquet procedure for the management of cranial cruciate ligament rupture in a dog - a case report,"Cranial cruciate ligament rupture is the major cause of lameness and degenerative joint disease in the canine stifle. The cause of this disease is multifactorial, especially involving degenerative and inflammatory changes. Many techniques have been described for the management of this condition, and current recommendations include the use of corrective osteotomies, most recently using the Maquet (or modified Maquet) procedure. This technique is fundamentally similar to the classical tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA), but without the use of the bone plate. The main advantages of using this technique are a shorter operative time and less use of implants. The main complication of this technique is an increased risk of tibial crest fracture. This report describes the Maquet technique for the treatment of a three-year-old male West White Terrier dog with rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament. Cruciate ligament rupture was diagnosed by a positive cranial tibial drawer test. Mediolateral stifle radiography performed under anesthesia with the stifle in 135° of extension demonstrated a tibial plateau angle of 22°. A cage of six millimeters was necessary to allow advancement. The Maquet technique produced excellent post-operative results, including early weight-bearing and neutralization of the cranial tibial drawer. The consolidation time of the osteotomy was 63 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22602/20560,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Dermatophytosis due to Microsporum nanum infection in a canine,"Miscrosporum nanum is a dermatophyte found in swine that causes non-pruritic lesions with desquamation, alopecia, and circular characteristics. M. nanum infection in dogs is rare and poorly understood in terms of its epidemiological and clinical features, and its therapeutic response. The present report describes a case of dermatophytosis due to M. nanum in a Dogo Argentino breed of dog that was used for wild boar hunting. The dermatophytosis presented with hypotrichosis, erythema, and non-pruritic desquamation in the back of the neck and chest area. The dermatophytosis was responsive to systemic treatment with itraconazole and topical (miconazole 2%) for 60 days. Thus, we conclude that the practice of hunting wild boar should be considered as a possible source of infection of M. nanum in the reported dog. The M. nanum infection showed clinical features that were similar to the lesions observed in swine, except for the absence of the circular pattern, and showed a good clinical response to the therapy. Finally, M. nanum should be considered as an etiologic agent of dermatophytosis in dogs that in some manner have had direct contact with domestic or wild swine.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22424/20559,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physical properties of sunflower seeds during drying,"The aim of this work was to determine the effect that the moisture content has on the physical properties of sunflower seeds. The cultivar Olisun 3, with an initial moisture content of 34.1 (% wb), was used and then subjected to drying in an oven with forced air ventilation under three temperature conditions: 40, 60 and 80 °C. The reduction in the moisture content during drying was monitored by the gravimetric method until it reached a final moisture content of 8.0 ± 1.0 (% wb). The physical properties were analysed: the bulk density, true density, intergranular porosity and volumetric shrinkage of the mass and unit and terminal velocity. The reduction in the moisture content influenced the physical properties of sunflower seeds and caused a decrease in the intergranular porosity, bulk density and true density at all examined temperatures. The mass and volumetric contractions of the unit and reduction in shrinkage rates all increased with the drying of sunflower seeds at all studied temperatures. The terminal velocity increased as the moisture content of the grains increased, which was more evident at the drying temperature of 80 °C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23765/20669,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nitrogen during the establishment period of Mombasa grass,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nitrogen (N) concentration during the establishment period of Mombasa grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.). The experiment was conducted using four different N concentrations (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha) during the establishment period in order to evaluate the effect of nitrogen on the plant. These effects were assessed using different indexes, including the efficiency of nitrogen use and agricultural, physiological and nutritional efficiencies. We also determined the total dry matter and nitrogen accumulation in the plant. The recovery of applied N and the agronomic efficiency of Mombasa grass were found to be greater with increasing N concentrations, and all indexes tested were found to be affected by the concentration of applied N. Based on the indexes studied, 90 kg N/ha was found to be most suitable for Mombasa grass during the establishment period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25979/20577,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Bio-economic assessment of sheep supplementation in marandu palisadegrass pastures,"Goal was to evaluate the effect of mineral and/or energy-protein supplementation on intake, behavior, production response, pH, rumen ammonia and production cost of sheep. Twenty female lambs and five rumen-cannulated lambs were used to test supplementation effects on weight gain and nutritional characteristics, respectively. Treatments evaluated were: mineral mixture, supplement with 20 and 25% of crude protein offered at 0.5 and 1.0% of body weight. Supplementation at 1.0% of body weight reduced forage intake. Average daily gain were: -58.33, -1.07, -9.53, 19.27 and 34.73 g day-1 per animal, for mineral mixture, supplements with 20 and 25% of crude protein supplied at 0.5% of body weight and 20 and 25% crude protein provided at 1.0% of body weight, respectively. Rumen pH for all supplements was maintained above 6.20. Values of rumen ammonia nitrogen were 5.10, 9.48, 11.54, 17.51 and 22.45 mg dL-1 for supplements: mineral mixture, 20 and 25% of crude protein provided at 0.5% of body weight and 20 and 25% of crude protein supplied at 1.0% of body weight, respectively.

1,1978,Fractionation of carbohydrates and nitrogenous constituents of late-crop corn silages ensiled with different specific masses,"The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of carbohydrates and nitrogenous fractions of late-crop corn silages with different specific masses (SM; 90, 134, 172, and 214 kg dry matter m-3). The silage was held in 20-L mini-silos, and the experimental design was completely randomized, with four replications (mini-silos) per treatment. Fractionation was performed according to The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPSv5.0). The SM of the silage significantly affected the contents of ether extract ( ? = 1.718 + 0.0041?SM; P = 0.009; R2 = 39.2), soluble sugars ( ? = 0.9502 - 0.003445?SM; P < 0.001; R2 = 59.9), and soluble fiber ( ? = -0.4731 + 0.01158?SM; P = 0.025; R2 = 31.2). In addition, SM also affected carbohydrate fraction B1 in a linear manner ( ? = 14.88 + 0.2566?SM; P = 0.043; R2 = 38.4), whereas the remaining fractions were unaffected. Furthermore, no change was observed in total N ( ? = 2.003 - 0.01065?SM + 0.000036?SM2; P = 0.041; R2 = 38.8), non-protein N ( ? = 1.436 - 0.01103?SM + 0.000036?SM2; P = 0.060; R2 = 35.1), soluble N ( ? = 1.715 - 0.01450?SM + 0.00005?SM2; P = 0.024; R2 = 43.8), or neutral detergent insoluble N ( ? = 0.4979 - 0.001057?SM; P < 0.001; R2 = 70.6). The results also contributed to the differences in fractions A ( ? = 66.47- 0.5291?SM + 0.00174?SM2; P = 0.095; R2 = 30.4), B2 ( ? = 6.78 + 0.05857?SM; P = 0.076; R2 = 20.8), and B3 (? = 19.03 - 0.05565?SM; P = 0.018, R2 = 34,1) of the Cornell model. In the present study, differences in the compression (i.e., SM) of corn silages caused changes in the contents of soluble sugar and nitrogenous constituents; however, SM alone did not explain the entire preservation of the ensiled material.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25856/20575,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Chemical composition of corn silage produced by scientific studies in Brazil - A meta-analysis,"The objective of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis that compared the chemical composition of corn silage produced for different experimental purposes, i.e., by research groups that studied corn silage (SCS) or by research groups that only used corn silage (UCS) as a form of roughage. We analyzed 203 papers that were published between January 1994 and December 2014 and contained a total of 647 treatments and the analysis of 1701 silos. We found a significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the dry matter (DM) content of SCS silage (33.00%) and that of UCS silage (30.64%). The DM contents of neutral detergent fiber for the SCS and UCS silage were high (54.72 and 55.14% DM, respectively) but were not significantly different from one another (P = 0.5936), and the acid detergent fiber content of the UCS silage (31.04% DM) was higher than that of the SCS silage (29.65%, P = 0.0214), which indicated that the UCS silage was less digestible than the SCS silage. This was also corroborated (P = 0.0064) by the mean content of total digestible nutrients (64.18% DM) in the UCS silage, which likely results from the lower level of care taken when using standard silage production methods, compared to that taken by SCS researchers. Therefore, we concluded that the corn silage produced by research groups in Brazil are not analyzed in full and that, as a result, there is a paucity of important information, such as the content of organic acids. In addition, we also found that corn silage produced in Brazil contains a high level of neutral detergent fiber.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25966/20576,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genotype x environment interaction on post-weaning performance and carcass in beef cattle,"We analyzed average daily gain from weaning to yearling (ADG), yearling weight (YW), rib eye area, and subcutaneous fat thickness of 91 Angus, Hereford, Caracu, and Nellore cattle, and their crosses. The animals were split into two grazing groups: improved natural grassland (n = 47) and natural grassland (n = 44). The environment was found to influence all traits, and the highest measures of performance were observed in improved natural grassland. The genetic group x environment interaction was verified only for ADG and YW (P < 0.05). We found the best performance trait averages for crossbreeds of Bos taurus and Bos indicus. In addition, we found genetic x environment interaction effects in growing traits and Longissimus muscle area between the evaluated genotype groups. Finally, we found that between the evaluated genotype groups, subcutaneous adipose fat was not influenced by the environment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25818/20574,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Technical efficiency and economic viability of different cattle identification methods allowed by the Brazilian traceability system,"We aimed to evaluate the technical efficiency and economic viability of the implementation and use of four cattle identification methods allowed by the Brazilian traceability system. The study was conducted in a beef cattle production system located in the State of Mato Grosso, from January to June 2012. Four identification methods (treatments) were compared: T1: ear tag in one ear and ear button in the other ear (eabu); T2: ear tag and iron brand on the right leg (eaib); T3: ear tag in one ear and tattoo on the other ear (eata); and T4: ear tag in one ear and electronic ear tag (eael) on the other. Each treatment was applied to 60 Nelore animals, totaling 240 animals, divided equally into three life stages (calves, young cattle, adult cattle). The study had two phases: implementation (phase 1) and reading and transfer of identification numbers to an electronic database (phase 2). All operating expenses related to the two phases of the study were determined. The database was constructed, and the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS® 17.0 software. Regarding the time spent on implementation (phase 1), conventional ear tags and electronic ear tags produced similar results, which were lower than those of hot iron and tattoo methods, which differed from each other. Regarding the time required for reading the numbers on animals and their transcription into a database (phase 2), electronic ear-tagging was the fastest method, followed by conventional ear tag, hot iron and tattoo. Among the methods analyzed, the electronic ear tag had the highest technical efficiency because it required less time to implement identifiers and to complete the process of reading and transcription to an electronic database and because it did not exhibit any errors. However, the cost of using the electronic ear-tagging method was higher primarily due to the cost of the device.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25801/20657,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Digestibility and performance of lambs fed diets containing old man saltbush hay,"The aim of this study was to evaluate feed intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, water balance, and performance of lambs fed diets containing old man saltbush hay associated with a concentrate. Thirty-two castrated feedlot Santa Inês lambs at approximately eight months of age, with 22 ± 1.97 kg body weight, were distributed into a completely randomized experimental design. Acid detergent fiber intake increased (P < 0.05), whereas non-fibrous carbohydrates intake decreased (P < 0.01). Inclusion of old man saltbush in the diet reduced (P < 0.01) the digestibility of dry and organic matter, neutral and acid detergent fiber, and non-fibrous carbohydrates. The intakes of digestible dry and organic matter, ether extract, total carbohydrates, and digestible non-fibrous carbohydrates also decreased (P < 0.01). Inclusion of old man saltbush did not influence water consumption from the trough by the sheep, averaging 4,327.20 mL/day?1. Body weight at slaughter and daily weight gain decreased linearly (P < 0.05) and feed conversion worsened as old man saltbush hay was added to the diet. Inclusion of old man saltbush at up to 40% replacing the concentrate in feedlot lamb diets does not compromise the performance of these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25773/20572,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Spatial distribution of microregions specialized in milk production,"The aim of this study was to verify and characterizes the spatial distribution of the microregions specialized in bovine milk production in Paraná State, Brazil, using data from the Municipal Livestock Survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Central Bank of Brazil’s National Program to Strengthen Household Agriculture (PRONAF), from 2000 to 2012. Methodologically, we carry out location quotient (LQ), principal component, (PCA) and cluster analyses. Based on the results of the LQ, of the 39 microregions in Paraná State analyzed, 13 are identified as specializing in milk production. In particular, the West and Southwest mesoregions as well as the microregion of Ponta Grossa, in relative terms, account for 58% of the milk produced in the study period. Additionally, based on the PCA, 2 principal components are found to explain 91.5% of the variability in the data, termed technically enhanced production and household production. Finally, by using cluster analysis, five groups are identified among the microregions specializing in milk production, thus indicating marked heterogeneity across the state. This situation requires the expansion of public policies that mitigate regional disparities and provide the state with production gains from milk farming.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25656/20571,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Propolis residue inclusion in the diet affects digestive enzyme activity in broiler chickens,"This study investigated the effects of the inclusion of solid propolis residue (PR) from alcoholic propolis extraction in the diets of broiler chickens from 1 to 21-d of age on their performance, intestinal morphology, and digestive enzyme activity. 405 male chicks were distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments (inclusion of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4% PR in the diets), and three replications with 27 birds each. The birds were fed experimental diets from 1 to 21-d of age and basal diet from 22 to 42-d of age. Feed intake (from 1 to 21-d and 1 to 42-d of age) decreased linearly with increasing levels of PR inclusion (P < 0.05). Dietary inclusion of PR did not affect intestinal morphology at 7 and 21-d of age (P > 0.05). Pancreatic amylase activity presented a quadratic response at 7 and 21-d of age, with its lowest activity estimated at 2.45 and 1.91% PR inclusion, respectively. At 7-d of age, trypsin activity decreased linearly, whereas chymotrypsin activity varied quadratically, with its activity estimated at 2.06% PR inclusion. Intestinal maltase activity varied quadratically with lowest activity predicted at 1.57% PR inclusion at 21-d of age. The dietary inclusion of solid propolis residue of propolis decreases feed intake in broilers and modulates their intestinal and pancreatic enzyme activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25605/20569,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Sorghum and black oat forage production and its nutritive value under phosphate levels,"Phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting mineral elements for biomass and grain production in tropical soils. This study was undertaken to assess the influence of P on herbage accumulation (DM) and the nutritive value of forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and black oat (Avena strigosa) in succession. Evaluated treatments were P fertilization levels of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg of P2O5 ha-1 distributed in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The treatments were applied at sorghum seeding in the summer 2010/2011 and 2011/2012. Black oat was seeded following sorghum in 2011 with no additional P fertilization. Herbage production and its nutritive value were assessed by successive cuts. The greatest sorghum DM yields were obtained at the highest phosphate level tested (200 kg P2O5 ha-1), with residual response in subsequent black oat. There was no effect of P fertilization levels on the nutritive values of both crops, considering crude protein (CP) levels, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), what demonstrates that P addition has no effect in forage nutritive value, especially when the soil P levels are classified as medium or high. The plant P recovery efficiency decreased when increasing P fertilization levels for both sorghum and black oat. The level of 50 kg P2O5 ha-1 year-1 presented the greatest P recovery by plants, which supports the idea of less fertilizer use with more efficiency.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25606/20570,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Supplementation strategies for dairy cows kept in tropical grass pastures,"This study aimed to evaluate the supplementation strategies on forage intake and nutrient digestibility, feeding behavior, milk production and composition, feed efficiency, nitrogen balance and body weight change of dairy cows kept in Tanzania grass pastures (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzania) in the dry season. We used eight crossbred Holstein and Zebu cows in the final third of lactation, with an average weight of 505±44 kg and initial milk production of 9.0±1.44 kg day-1, in a double 4X4 Latin square design. The experiment consisted of four experimental periods of 17 days each, with nine days for initial adaptation and eight days to collect data. Treatments consisted of mineral mix and supplements (energy, protein or multiple) provided in the amount of 2 kg per cow day-1. Supplements promoted increased consumption of dry matter and nutrients (P < 0.05), without changing the forage intake in relation to the mineral mixture. The treatments did not affect the feeding behavior of animals (P > 0.05). There was an increase (P < 0.05) of 19.51% in milk production in the supplemented animals and productive responses approximate marginal 0.64 kg of milk for each kg of supplied supplement, however, the different supplements promoted a drop in the milk fat. There were higher net energy values of animal lactation for protein-energy supplementation and mineral mixture, but no change was observed in feed efficiency and energy efficiency. The performance of dairy cows kept in tropical grass pasture can be improved with the use of a concentrate supplementation of 0.40% of body weight per day-1 without compromising the forage intake of animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25604/20610,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Allometric growth of body components in crossbred ewe lambs fed increasing dietary concentrate levels,"This study aimed to evaluate the growth of body components in crossbred ewe lambs fed increasing levels of dietary concentrate and to determine the optimum level of supplementation for finishing ewe production. Thirty crossbred (½ Pantaneira × ½ Texel) wool ewe lambs fed Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.) and different dietary concentrate levels (20, 40, 60, and 80% DM basis) were selected for study. At the beginning of the study, six animals were slaughtered for determination of initial body composition. The remaining animals were slaughtered at approximately 48 kg live weight. The growth of body components in relation to body growth was estimated from the allometric model BC = a × (FBW)b, where BC is body component weight, a and b are growth equation parameters, and FBW is fasted body weight. Carcass, muscle, bone, and gastrointestinal tract were late maturing (b < 1, P < 0.01). Carcass and carcass fat growth was positively affected (linear, P < 0.05) by concentrate level. Total fat weight increased with increasing concentrate level (P < 0.05).

1,1978,Effect of season on haircoat characteristics and physiological parameters of Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá crossed heifers,"This study aimed to investigate haircoat characteristics and physiological parameters in summer and winter, morning and afternoon periods, of Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá crossed heifers in tropical environment. For this, twenty crossbred dairy heifers (Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá), reared in the city of Ibiá, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Haircoat thickness, i.e. distance from skin surface until hairend, average hair length, number of hairs per unit area, hair angle to the skin surface, cardiac and respiratory rates, rectal and body surface temperatures were measured. Data underwent analysis of variance and the means were compared by F test at 5% significance, except heart and respiratory rates and skin temperature within the season, which were compared by Mann Whitney test at 5%. For rectal temperature, the maximum value found was 39.53 °C in the summer afternoon. In the afternoon, rectal temperature was higher in summer compared to winter. Respiratory and heart rates and coat surface temperature were higher in the summer (34.00 movements min-1; 78.60 beats min-1; 37.97 °C respectively) compared to the winter (27.47 movements minutes -1; 58.72 beats min-1; 34,94ºC, respectively). Haircoat thickness and hair length were larger in winter (0.73; 1.82 cm, respectively) compared to summer (0.49; 1.11 cm, respectively). We concluded that the season of the year and day period interfere with most of the physiological parameters for thermoregulation and haircoat characteristics of crossbred heifers (Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá); however, they keep homeothermy, therefore are adapted to the region, and may be an alternative to be used by farmers of this region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24875/20566,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Productive characteristics of the grass Digitaria umfolozi subjected to defoliation frequencies,"An experiment was carried out to evaluate the dry matter production, total dry matter availability, daily dry matter accumulation rate, light interception, leaf area index, daily accumulation rate, dry matter availability of the morphological components (leaf blades, stems + sheaths and dead material), leaf/stem ratio, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre of Faixa-Brancagrass under seven defoliation frequencies (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days). Longer defoliation frequencies reduced the percentage of leaf blades and increased the percentage of stems + sheaths. The defoliation frequency positively influenced the availability of leaf blades, stems + sheaths, dead material and total dry matter. In the range of 42 days of defoliation, light interception reached 95%. At frequencies of 14 and 21 days of defoliation, the crude protein content of the leaves was above 20%. The highest utilization efficiency of D. umfolozi grass is achieved when the forage is managed with cutting intervals of 40 to 46 days. Higher defoliation frequencies positively contribute to the increase in the number of total white band grass leaves and higher crude protein content of the leaf blades and stems + sheaths.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19602/20603,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Supplementation of sheep with increasing levels of crude protein: performance, animal behavior, and contamination and spread of nematode larvae in Brachiaria brizantha ‘Xaraés’ pasture","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance, animal behavior, and contamination and spread of nematode larvae of sheep supplemented with increasing levels of protein (15, 25, and 35%) on Xaraés grass (Brachiaria brizantha ‘Xaraés’) pastures. Fifteen Santa Inês crossbred sheep, with an average age of approximately five months and average initial weight of 14.63 kg, were used in the experiment. The feeding behavior (grazing and idle times) of animals was found to be influenced by the supplementation provided. The highest level of supplementation provided to the animals reduced their grazing time. The different levels of supplementation influenced the average daily gain and total final body weight gain of the sheep in Xaraés grass pastures. A significant difference was observed in the presence of parasitic larvae in the Xaraés grass pastures depending on different protein levels throughout the regrowth period. The number of larvae in feces was influenced by the protein content of the supplement, and varied throughout the pasture rest period. Animals showed a decrease in the number of larvae as their dietary crude protein (CP) content was increased. Supplementation with high protein, together with the action of vermifuge, increased the performance of sheep and reduced their parasite load and grazing time in Xaraés grass pastures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23987/20565,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Morphogenic, structural, and productive characteristics of Cenchrus ciliaris L. grown using different levels of caprine and ovine biofertilize","The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphogenic, structural, and productive characteristics of Cenchrus ciliaris L. in response to different doses of biofertilizers that originate from the anaerobic biodigestion of goat and sheep fecal matter on Yellow Argisoil. The experiment was performed in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized factorial design using two types of biofertilizers and five dosages (0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10% of soil volume), with four repeats, for the duration of two vegetative cycles. In the first cycle, there was an increase in leaf lifespan and leaf/stem ratio with the use of 10% and 7.5% caprine biofertilizer, respectively. From the second cycle, doses of biofertilizers between 7.5% and 10% led to an improvement in the development of the morphogenic variables - leaf sprouting rate, leaf and pseudostem elongation rate, leaf lifespan, and senescence, as well as the structural characteristics - expanded leaf length and width, number of sprouting, expanded and live leaves, and expanded/expanding leaf ratio, resulting in a 73% increase in biomass. It was concluded that the use of biofertilizers improves the main morphogenic and structural characteristics of Cenchrus ciliaris L., resulting in increased fodder mass yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23777/20564,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Production and nutritional value of the wheat silage managed with different cutting systems,"Winter cereals are mainly used for human and animal nutrition and several studies are now exploring their potential as conserved forage (hay and silage). Among the winter cereal species available for cultivation in the south of Brazil, which is major winter cereals producer in the country, the wheat cv. BRS Umbu has attracted special attention. However, few studies have investigated the potential of this cultivar for silage production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the production and quality of silage from the dual-purpose wheat, BRS Umbu, subjected to different cut managements treatments: T1 - without cut (control), T2 - one cut and T3 - two cuts. Each plot represented an experimental unit in a randomized block design, with 5 replicates per treatment. Two representative samples were collected from each plot to determine morphological segmentation (stem, leaf and ear) and dry matter (DM) content of the whole plant and its morphological components. At the time of opening of the silos, food chemical analysis and pH determination were performed. Forage mass production decreased by 26.88% and 67.82%, respectively, with one and two cuts, compared to control. The DM content of the ensiled plant was 49.9 g kg-1 for the control, 54.7 g kg-1 with one cut and 63.2 g kg-1 with two cuts, at the time of ensiling. Management cuts changed the morphological components of the plants, with a lower proportion of stem (28%) in plants subjected to two cuts. The control treatment showed fewer leaves in ensiled plant (9.6%) and intermediate amount of stalk (52.8%), and was significantly different (p < 0.05) to treatment of a cut. Regarding feed chemistry evaluations, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed for mineral matter (MM), crude protein (CP) and hemicellulose (HEM) between the different cutting regimens. However, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) decreased (p < 0.05) as the number of cuts increased. The control treatment showed higher NDF and ADF content (563.2 and 357.9 g kg-1 DM, respectively) and lower amount of total digestible nutrients (TDN) and net energy of lactation (NEL). However, the estimated milk production (EMP) was superior for this treatment (22,447 l ha-1), demonstrating the high impact of reduced forage mass production with increased number of cuts.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19579/20562,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Bovine respiratory disease associated with Histophilus somni and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in a beef cattle feedlot from Southeastern Brazil,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a complex multifactorial and multi-etiological disease entity that is responsible for the morbidity and mortality particularly in feedlot cattle from North America. Information relative to the occurrence of BRD in Brazil and the associated infectious agents are lacking. This study investigated the participation of infectious agents of BRD in a beef cattle feedlot from Southeastern Brazil. Nasopharyngeal swabs of 11% (10/90) of cattle (n, 450) with clinical manifestations of respiratory distress were analyzed by targeting specific genes of the principal infectious pathogens of BRD. In addition, pulmonary fragments of one the animals that died were collected for histopathological and molecular diagnoses. The nucleic acids of Histophilus somni and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were identified in 20% (2/10) of the nasopharyngeal swabs of the animals with respiratory distress; another contained only BRSV RNA. Moreover, the nucleic acids of both infectious agents were amplified from the pulmonary fragments of the animal that died with histopathological evidence of bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia; the nasopharyngeal swab of this animal also contained the nucleic acids of both pathogens. Additionally, all PCR and/or RT-PCR assays designed to detect the specific genes of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus -1, bovine parainfluenza virus-3, and bovine coronavirus yielded negative results. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the isolates of H. somni circulating in Brazil are similar to those identified elsewhere, while there seem to be diversity between the isolates of BRSV within cattle herds from different geographical locations of Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25499/20670,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Neospora caninum: Seroprevalence in beef cattle in the mountainous region of Santa Catarina, Brazil","The distribution of Neospora caninum, an important agent of reproductive disorders in cattle, has been frequently reported in dairy cattle in Brazil and worldwide. Records of infection are less frequent in beef cattle. To determine the seroprevalence of bovine neosporosis, 507 beef cattle blood samples were collected from January 2013 to September 2015, from 16 municipalities of the Associação dos Municípios da Região Serrana (AMURES). Samples were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies ( ? 1:100) against N. caninum by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Information about sex, age, and origin of the bovines were obtained from the Brazilian Bovine and Bubaline Identification and Certification System (SISBOV), and were tabulated for statistical analysis (Chi-square and Fisher Exact test, P ? 0.05). Of the 507 serum samples analyzed, 70 (13.81%) contained antibodies against N. caninum with titers of 1:100 (16), 1:200 (22), 1:400 (17), 1:800 (nine), 1:1600 (four) and 1:3200 (two). Positive specimens were collected from 13 of the 16 municipalities and across all age groups. Of the positive samples, there were no statistical differences between males and females (32.86% vs. 67.14%, P= 0.1072), age groups (P= 0.4116), or municipalities (P= 0.6838). While not statistically significant (P>0.05), higher seroprevalence was observed among older females. Although seroprevalence was relatively low, results indicate that infection by N. caninum in beef cattle is widespread in the studied region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25365/20519,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Thermoduric psychrotrophic proteolytic microbiota from refrigerated raw milk,"Thermoduric microorganisms may withstand high temperatures during the pasteurization of milk. Therefore, the microbiota in pasteurized milk consist of thermoduric microbes and directly influence the shelf-life of the milk. The aim of this study was to identify thermoduric psychrotrophic proteolytic microbiota in refrigerated raw milk. Twenty samples, previously heat-treated, were streaked and incubated at 7°C for 10 days. The strains isolated were streaked on milk agar to assess proteolytic activity and were initially analyzed morphologically by light microscopy and then by molecular techniques to identify the species. In 40% of the samples analyzed was observed only one bacterial growth and others 10 thermoduric psychrotrophic fungi. All isolates were proteolytic. The sequencing of 16S rRNA gene identified the bacterial strain as Bacillus pumilus and analysis of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of fungal isolates revealed the Cladosporium cladosporioides (60%), Curvularia geniculatus (10%), and the 3 remaining strains were identified as Geotrichum candidum (30%). This is a fist description of B. pumilus in Brazilian raw milk. Considering the spoilage potential of all isolates and of the fungi present in raw milk and their survival in pasteurized milk, it is extremely important to carry out further studies to your resistant to heat, their impact on the shelf-life of pasteurized milk, ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk and dairy products.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25121/20507,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Anti-Neospora caninum antibodies among dairy cattle in a rural settlement, Paraná, Brazil","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of antibodies against Neospora caninum, obtained two years apart, among dairy cattle in a rural settlement in southern Brazil. Blood samples from 734 dairy cattle on 41 farms were collected at two different times: in 2012, 406 animals on 30 farms were used; and in 2014, 329 animals on 31 farms. Serum samples were obtained and were used to detect antibodies against N. caninum, by means of the indirect fluorescence assay (IFA). Animals with titers ? 100 were considered positive. The total serum prevalence of anti-N. caninum antibodies was 19.7% (145/736) among all the dairy cattle, comprising 23.1% (94/406) in 2012 and 15.5% (51/329) in 2014. Serum from 91 animals was tested in both trials: 11(12.1%) showed positivity in 2012 and 10 (11%) in 2014. The variables of age, sex and breed did not show any associations with seropositivity. Thus, we showed that the cattle in this settlement presented high levels of antibodies against N. caninum, and that IFA showed good efficacy for epidemiological studies.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24600/20516,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Haemonchus contortus resistance to monepantel in sheep: fecal egg count reduction tests and randomized controlled trials,"Worm infections are a major cause of economic losses in sheep farming, and their control depends essentially on anthelmintic drugs. After decades without the discovery of new drug types, a new class of anthelmintics, called aminoacetonitrile derivatives, represented by monepantel, was released on the market. In order to evaluate a report of low efficacy of monepantel on a sheep farm in the municipality of Taiúva, state of São Paulo, Brazil, fecal egg count reduction and critical tests were performed on a Haemonchus contortus strain collected from this farm. To this end, ten animals were experimentally infected with 5000 H. contortus third-stage larvae, and these animals were divided into two groups, control and treated, according to the treatment with monepantel. The parameters evaluated were reduction in fecal egg counts on post-treatment days (PTD) 0, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and the therapeutic efficacy at the end of this period. Egg count reduction was observed starting on PTD 2, with a maximum reduction of 32.89% recorded on PTD 14. The critical test revealed 24.65% efficacy, indicating resistance to the active ingredient monepantel. The ineffectiveness of monepantel may be associated with the excessive use of the anthelmintic, which the farmer administered at intervals of less than one month, without technical guidance or a defined criterion. Given that the anthelmintic was used on this farm for less than one year, according to the farmer, it can be inferred that H. contortus develops resistance to monepantel in a few generations if the product is used incorrectly.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23164/20527,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"A serological survey of agents causing leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis in Rattus rattus in the city of Umuarama, northwest Paraná, Brazil","Synanthropic rodents, present in both urban and rural areas, are responsible for the zoonotic transmission of several diseases to humans as well as for significant economic losses. They act as reservoirs for important viral diseases, bacterial diseases such as leptospirosis, and parasitic diseases such as toxoplasmosis and leishmaniasis. The aim of the present study was to assess the seropositivity of synanthropic rodents in Umuarama city, located in the northwestern region of Paraná State, Brazil, to agents causing leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis. The microscopic agglutination technique (MAT) was used to detect anti-Leptospira antibodies, and the indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IIFR) was used to detect anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. Of 178 animals collected, four (2.24%) were seropositive for Leptospira spp. and ten (5.62%) for Toxoplasma gondii. Ninety-five (53.38%) of the collected animals were male and 83 (46.62%) were female, and two (1.23%) originated from urban areas while 176 (98.87%) originated from peri-urban areas. Serological results showed that the synanthropic rodents examined here had low seroreactivity for agents causing both leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis, in both urban and peri-urban regions of Umuarama city. This could be associated with the high Human Development Index for the study area. However, preventative measures must continue to be observed, as rodents are important reservoirs for, and disseminators of, disease causing agents.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23337/20515,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Collagen quantification in rabbit dermal wounds treated with heterologous platelet-rich plasma gel,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been extensively studied as a biomaterial for wound treatment, and the heterologous PRP is usefulin the event that obtaining the patient’s own blood is impossible. This study aimed to evaluate and compare wound healing in rabbits and quantify the collagen in experimentally induced wounds in a control group and in a group treated with heterologous PRP gel. We hypothesize that this gelis capable of promoting proper healing with no adverse reactions, increased collagen content. The clinical aspects of coloring, edema, hyperemia, exudation, crust, granulation, pain sensitivity, and retraction index of the wounds were measuredon days 7, 14, and 17 after the injury. Collagen quantification by Picrosirius staining and evaluation under polarized light was performed on the 17th day. Crust was present in both groups at all evaluated time points, with the absence of other clinical signs. The wound contraction rate and collagen quantity did not differ between groups. In conclusion, the suggested hypothesis was partially confirmed; the heterologous PRP gel was unable to increase the amount of collagen and accelerate the wound healing process, however, wound healing was efficient and similar in both groups and there was no local adverse reaction. Thus, despite the scarcity of studies in the literature, the heterologous PRP gel is an effective alternative treatment for wounds in the absence of other sources of PRP.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24508/22162,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Cardiorespiratory and electrocardiographic effects of methadone or morphine in the perioperative period in anesthetized dogs with continuous rate infusion of propofol and submitted to ovariohysterectomy,"The aims of this study were compare the electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiopulmonary effects of methadone or morphine, both injected intravenously (IV) in dogs anesthetized with continuous infusion of propofol. Sixteen healthy female mongrel dogs were used in this study for elective ovariohysterectomy. The animals were allocated in random order into two groups assigned GME (methadone 0.3 mg kg-1, IV) or GMO (morphine 0.3 mg kg-1, IV). Parameters were evaluated: heart rate (HR), P-wave amplitude (Ps and PmV), interval between Ps and R waves (PR), QRS duration (QRS), R-wave amplitude (R), duration the interval between the Q and T waves (QT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), end tidal of carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and periferic oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2). Postoperative analgesia was assessed by mechanical nociceptive stimulus based on the scale proposed by Firth and Haldane (1999) and rescue analgesia based on the visual analogue scale. HR was lower in GME in relation to GMO. The P, PmV, PR, QRS, R and QT values remained within their normality tracks, showing no clinical importance. Apnea and ETCO2 increased in both groups. There was no difference between groups of the analgesic effects. It can be concluded that methadone and morphine promote similar cardiovascular effects after IV injection during surgery in dogs anesthetized with propofol by continuous rate infusion, however, when methadone used, assisted ventilation is required. In addition, both drugs promote postoperative analgesia until six hours.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21245/20493,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Sensory and chemical properties of peanut grains (Arachis hypogaea L) roasted in microwave or oven,"Peanut grains are an excellent source of proteins and lipids. Before consumption, peanuts are subjected to a roasting process to acquire desirable sensory characteristics, in addition to eliminating microorganisms present. However, this processing step can cause various changes in lipid and protein fraction of grains, which are not totally elucidated in the literature. This study evaluated parameters such as the lipid acidity, peroxide value, primary (K232) and secondary (K270) products of lipid oxidation, fatty acid profile, reducing sugars, browning index, protein solubility, protein content and intention to purchase of peanut kernels with four colors of testa (striped, rose, red and black), subjected to the roasting process in microwave or oven. After processing, there was a reduction in lipid acidity and unsaturated fatty acids and an increase in saturated fatty acids, peroxide value, K232 and K270 in oil. There was a reduction in protein solubility and reducing sugars, with an increase in browning index. The purchase intention was higher for microwave-roasted red and rose peanut grains, which makes this form of processing interesting due to its convenience and speed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25305/20492,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Comparative neurotoxicity of iobitridol with iohexol by intracisternal administration in Wistar rats,"Iobitridol is a tri-iodinated contrast agent, and neurotoxicologic studies of the intracisternal administration are scarce and inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to compare the neurotoxicity of iobitridol with iohexol, by intracisternal administration in Wistar rats, for a pre-clinical evaluation of its use as a myelographic agent. The animals, a total of 75, were divided into three experimental groups, iobitridol, iohexol and cerebral artificial fluid (control group), with 25 animals per group. Then, these were divided into five subgroups of five animals each, and given doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg kg-1, while the control group received the equivalent volumes of contrast media tested. The animals were evaluated after 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min of intracisternal administration of these substances, for signs of depression and excitement, tactile palmar grasp, flexor, extensor, palpebral, papillary and pinna reflexes, surface righting and placing reactions, and with an auditory startle test. The evaluations were assessed daily for seven days with these parameters and their body weight, food, and water intake were also measured. There were no statistically significant differences between groups tested with respect to any of the evaluated parameters. In other words, in this animal model, the iobitridol demonstrated a low neurotoxicologic potential, comparable to that observed with iohexol. Further study with dogs and cats, as an alternative, is suggested.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22640/20494,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mechanical properties of baru fruit (Dipteryx alata Vogel),"This paper aimed to verify the influence of moisture content and drying temperature on the values of maximum compression strength for fixed strains (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; and 7 mm), rupture force, and proportional deformity modulus on the baru fruit (Dipteryx alata Vogel) under compression in a natural resting position. Baru fruits with a moisture content ranging from 0.333 to 0.053 (decimal dry basis - db) were used. The fruits were uniaxially compressed between two parallel plates, in the natural resting position, and the nuts were dried at temperatures of 60, 80, and 100 °C. The reduction in the moisture content during drying was monitored using a gravimetric method (weight loss) to determine the initial moisture content of the product and the final moisture content. Based on our results, the compression force needed to deform the baru fruit decreased with increasing moisture content, regardless of the drying temperature. The proportional deformity modulus increased with the reduction of moisture content for all the studied temperatures. The reduced moisture content increased the force required to rupture the baru fruit, regardless of the drying temperature. The rupture forces of temperatures of 60 to 100 °C may be represented by one model.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25277/20491,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Microbiological evaluation of lettuce produced by conventional and organic systems in farms of Londrina, PR","The aims of this study were to evaluate the contamination of lettuce (Lactuca sativa), produced in Londrina, Paraná (PR), with total coliform, coliform at 45 °C, E. coli, and Salmonella spp.; and to determine the E. coli contamination of irrigation water used at the farms studied. Four farms were evaluated, of which three produced lettuce using a conventional system and one using an organic system. An evaluation of the production practices of the farms was also carried out. A total of 111 samples were analyzed, 71 lettuce samples from the conventional system and 40 samples from the organic system. A total of eight irrigation water samples were collected for analysis. Coliform at 45 °C counts above the limit tolerated by Brazilian legislation were observed in 2.8% (2/71) of conventionally grown lettuce samples, and Salmonella spp. was isolated in 1.4% (1/71) of those samples. In the organic lettuce samples, 12.5% (5/40) had coliform at 45 °C counts above the limit tolerated and Salmonella spp. was not detected. Irrigation water samples from three farms were unsatisfactory, with counts higher than 102MPN of E. coli per 100mL. The results of this study demonstrate that most conventionally grown lettuce samples show good sanitary conditions in production, and that lettuce contamination is not related to contamination found in irrigation water samples. The results also showed that the organic production practices required by Brazilian certification agencies should be applied to ensure that contamination of produced lettuce remains controlled.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24889/20488,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of termite activity on soil under different land management strategies,"Mound-building termites are important agents of soil bioperturbation, but these species have not been extensively studied thus far. The present study aimed to evaluate the soil particle-size and the chemical attributes of termite mounds and the surrounding soil under different land use strategies. A one-hectare plot was defined for an unmanaged degraded pasture, planted pasture, and for a eucalyptus Corymbia citriodora plantation. In each plot, the top, center, and base sections of five Cornitermes cumulans mounds, and the surrounding soil at the depths of 0-5; 5-10; 10-20 cm, were sampled in the Pinheiral, Rio de Janeiro state. In the three areas, the center of the mounds contained higher clay content, organic carbon, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium, total bases, and cation exchangeable capacity, when compared to the top, base, and the surrounding soils. However, the center had lower values of exchangeable acidity and potassium, of the three areas. In the eucalyptus plantation, the values of pH, total bases, calcium, and magnesium were lower, whereas aluminum, exchangeable acidity, sodium, and cation exchange capacity were higher both in the mounds and in the surrounding soil, in relation to the pastures. There were no differences among the three areas in terms of organic carbon, potassium, phosphorous, and total bases, in the mounds and adjacent soil. Thus, the termite activity altered the clay content and most of the soil chemical properties in all of the studied areas, but only for the center of the mounds. However, the effect of these organisms was different in the eucalyptus plantation in relation to the pasture areas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23899/20485,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Canopy growth and productivity of Jatropha genotypes,"Information of jatropha genotypes yield are scarce, but necessary to promote the crop establishment, so it is very important for the commercial planting of this crop. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the canopy growth and productivity of three jatropha genotypes. The experimental design was a randomized block, with 15 treatments, three replications and five plants per plot. The jatropha genotypes were selected because they have some special characteristics: (CNPAE-107 - small size, CNPAE-133 - productive and CNPAE-169 - seeds without toxicity) obtained in the Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Agroenergy, Brasília, DF, Brazil. The data were collected for five cycles of production. We evaluated: grain yield; height and canopy volume. Treatments differ in all characteristics. Jatropha grain yield has been growing along the first four years of evaluation, however, in the fifth year production was lower when compared to the fourth year. The most productive genotype was CNPAE-133 (2123.8 Kg ha-1 year), followed by CNPAE-107 genotypes (2076.5 Kg ha-1 year) and CNPAE-169 (913 Kg ha-1 year), the highest yields were obtained at 3.7 years.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23882/20484,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fish consumers in the pioneer northern Region of the State of Paraná,"The social, economic and cultural situation and the habits and preferences of fish consumers are analyzed. The municipalities focused for current research are Bandeirantes, Cambará, Santo Antônio da Platina, Andirá, Cornélio Procópio and Itambaracá, within the meso-region of the so-called Pioneer Northern Region of the state of Paraná, Brazil. Three hundred and forty-six structured questionnaires with seventeen multiple choice objective questions, featuring qualitative and quantitative variables, were handed out. Results show that 92% of the interviewed people ate fish; 55% earned more than three Brazilian minimum wages; 41% went to secondary school and 66% of the families comprised between three and five members. Mean fish consumption reached 18 kg/inhab/year; 54% of interviewed were over 40 years old; 37% preferred fish fillet; mostly prepared as fried fish. Moreover, the main obstacles for increase in consumption for 53% of the interviewed were high prices and non-availability of the product. The supermarket was the preferred place for purchase. Consumers in the Pioneer Northern Region of the Paraná have a relevant preference for fish, with a high capacity for per capita consumption increase even though supply and prices are strategic issues which require investigation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24877/20655,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Dormancy overcoming, temperatures and substrates on germination of Mimosa tenuiflora Willd seeds","Mimosa tenuiflora Willd., popularly known as jurema-preta, is an arboreal species of great importance for the brazilian Northeast due to its uses as a medicinal plant and in the restoration of degraded soils. No information is available in the Rules for Seed Analysis and the Instructions for Seed Analysis of Forest Species regarding ideal conditions for of this species. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of pre-germination treatments, in addition to verifying the germination performance at different temperatures and in different substrates. In both experiments, four replicates of 25 seeds were used for each treatment. In experiment I, seeds were submitted to the following methods for overcoming dormancy: witness - Intact seeds (T1) immersion in water at 100 °C for 1 (T2), 2 (T3), 3 (T4), 4 (T5), 5 (T6) and 6 min (T7), immersion in concentrated sulfuric acid for 1 (T8), 4 (T9), 7 (T10), 10 (T11) and 13 min (T12), scarification on sandpaper n° 80 (T13) and lopping in the region opposite the micropyle (T14). In experiment II, seed germination was evaluated in four types of substrates: between sand, paper on, paper roll and between vermiculite and at six different temperatures: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 °C and alternating between 20 and 30 °C. Immersion in hot water for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 min, sulfuric acid treatment for 10 and 13 min, sand paper and lopping were the most appropriate treatments to overcome seed dormancy. The seed germination of M. Tenuiflora should be carried out at 25 °C on paper roll substrate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23709/20654,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study focused to evaluate the effects of different land uses, management systems and their respective terms on organic carbon content and physical properties of a Latossolo Amarelo (Oxisol) in the Southwestern Piauí state. The study was performed in the city of Uruçuí, situated in the southwestern Piauí state. We assessed nine farming areas with different backgrounds regarding land-use, management system and run time. The treatments consisted of areas under no-till for 3 and 6 years (NT3 and NT6), under pasture for 2 and 5 years (PA2 and PA6), under eucalyptus plantation for six and twelve years (EU6 and EU12), under conventional tillage for two and 8 years (CT2 and CT8) and under native Cerrado (NC), which represented a reference condition. Conversion of the native Cerrado into no-till and grazing areas increased soil organic carbon content over time.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23681/20482,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Size, chlorophyll retention and protein and oil contents of grains from soybean plants grown in different spatial arrangements","The spatial arrangement of soybean plants, determined by row spacing and seeding rate, affects the intraspecific competition for water, light, and nutrients, as well as plant architecture and grain development, quality, and chemical composition. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of row spacing and seeding rate on the grain size produced, and the influence of these three factors on chlorophyll retention and protein and oil content in grain. Two experiments were conducted in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 growing seasons, using a 4 × 3 factorial randomized block design with three replications. Four different row spacings [20 cm (narrow row), 50 cm (conventional), 20/80 cm (twin rows) and crossed lines (50 cm)] and three seeding rates (150, 300, and 450 thousand viable seeds ha-1) were evaluated. The grains were classified by size using oblong sieves and then the effects of spatial arrangements and size of grain on the percentage of green grains and protein and oil contents were evaluated. Higher plant densities were associated with larger grain size, whereas the effects of spacing between the rows on the grain size varied between growing seasons. The arrangement in cross-rows and high plant density produced a higher percentage of green grains under weather conditions favorable to the development of this attribute. The effects of plant spatial arrangements on the contents of protein and oil in grains were variable, and it was not possible to determine whether the spatial arrangement of plants had an effect on the levels of protein and oil in grains. Larger grains had higher protein content, but oil contents were not affected by grain size.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23582/20480,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Photosynthetic activity of young Ricinus communis L. plants under conditions of flooded soil,"Soil flooding is a stress condition that causes changes in hydric relationships and in the metabolism of crops, thereby affecting their productivity. To evaluate the effects of soil flooding on the chlorophyll a fluorescence transient, as well as gas exchange and Ricinus communis growth, young plants of the ‘AL Guarany 2002’ and ‘IAC Guarani’ cultivars, grown in a greenhouse, were subjected to flood conditions by maintaining a layer of water 2-3 cm above the soil. The stressed plants showed drastic reduction in net CO2 assimilation and growth variables. There was, however, an increase in performance index (PIABS e PITOTAL) at different moments of stress between the two cultivars. In general, R. communis plants possess mechanisms to protect the electron transport chain during a period of stress, without causing damage and reducing functionality. However, this is not enough to maintain photosynthetic activity owing to the decrease in stomatal conductance and intrinsic carboxylation efficiency, which affects biomass accumulation in stressed plants. In summary, this study found that the ‘AL Guarany 2002’ was found to be more sensitive to stress than the ‘IAC Guarani’ was.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23518/20479,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mapping of slopes for the operation of agricultural harvesters in Bandeirantes Municipality (PR),"The slope of terrain represents a risk factor for mechanized harvesting, leading to impediments or restrictions on agricultural operations, or even to machines toppling over in the field. Recently, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) has become widely adopted as one of the most viable techniques for obtaining slope and elevation. Therefore, this study aims to assess methods of acquiring DTMs to calculate the slope, and to determine the areas that are suitable and unsuitable for the operation of harvesters in the municipality of Bandeirantes (PR). Four methods were selected to produce DTMs for the construction of slope zoning maps applicable for harvester operations. The image sources included SRTM, ASTER GDEM, digitizing contour lines and kriging of spatial point data. After generating DTMs by the four different methods, the area suitable for the operation of harvesters was obtained based on the limits of operational slopes for harvesters in the literature. The high-resolution images, such as those obtained by scanning the contour lines and ASTER GDEM gave the best representation of the ground surface. Regardless of the method used to obtain the operational slopes, the municipality has a large area that is suitable for mechanized harvesting.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23612/20481,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic diversity in soybean seed quality under different storage conditions,"This study aimed to assess the effect of genetic diversity on physiological quality of soybean seeds stored in cold chamber and under environmental conditions. Ten cultivars were assessed in a randomized factorial design (2x10). Factor 1 corresponded to two storage conditions and factor 2 to ten soybean cultivars, with four replications. The evaluated variables were total germination (G%), first count of germination (F%), percentage of abnormal seedlings (AS%), germination speed index (GSI), water content (WC), electrical conductivity (EC), dry matter of seedlings (DMS) and length of seedlings (LS). Data underwent ANOVA, followed by Scott Knott test, as well as multivariate analysis of genetic diversity. The results showed a higher physiological quality for seeds under cold storage. Half of the cultivars (FPS Júpiter, FPS Urano, FPS Antares, FPS Netuno and CD 250) presented high germination rates and seed vigor, being thus indicated as high-standard materials for further breeding programs. Besides that, storage environment had influence on the clustering of soybean cultivars. Moreover, cultivars had genetic dissimilarity for almost all assessed traits as G%, GSI, F%, AS%, EC, DMS and LS.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23329/20478,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Improvement of antioxidant activities and yield of spring maize through seed priming and foliar application of plant growth regulators under heat stress conditions,"Heat stress during reproductive and grain filling phases adversely affects the growth of cereals through reduction in grain’s number and size. However, exogenous application of antioxidants, plant growth regulators and osmoprotectants may be helpful to minimize these heat induced yield losses in cereals. This two year study was conducted to evaluate the role of exogenous application of ascorbic acid (AsA), salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) applied through seed priming or foliar spray on biochemical, physiological, morphological and yield related traits, grain yield and quality of late spring sown hybrid maize. The experiment was conducted in the spring season of 2007 and 2008. We observed that application of AsA, SA and H2O2 applied through seed priming or foliar spray improved the physiological, biochemical, morphological and yield related traits, grain yield and grain quality of late spring sown maize in both years. In both years, we observed higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activity in the plants where AsA, SA and H2O2were applied through seed priming or foliar spray than control. Membrane stability index (MSI), relative water contents (RWC), chlorophyll contents, grain yield and grain oil contents were also improved by exogenous application of AsA, SA and H2O2 in both years. Seed priming of AsA, SA and H2O2was equally effective as the foliar application. In conclusion, seed priming with AsA, SA and H2O2 may be opted to lessen the heat induced yield losses in late sown spring hybrid maize. Heat tolerance induced by ASA, SA and H2O2 may be attributed to increase in antioxidant activities and MSI which maintained RWC and chlorophyll contents in maize resulting in better grain yield in heat stress conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22576/20477,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physicochemical quality of early-maturing ‘Navel’ sweet oranges,"The cultivation of new types of oranges can be a good alternative for citrus growers because there is a growing domestic market and good export prospects. Due to these expectations, it is essential to search for new cultivars for use in the fresh fruit industry. Therefore, the aim of this work was to physicochemically characterize the fruits of new cultivars of ‘Navel’ oranges, seeking alternatives with good characteristics, such as earliness, lack of seeds, good color and organoleptic characteristics desired by the consumer market. The fruits of five new cultivars of ‘Navel’ orange were evaluated, namely, ‘Bahia Valente’ (CN 28), ‘Golden Nugget Navel’ (CN 41), ‘‘Robertson Navel’’ (CN 39), ‘Washington Navel’ (CV 27) and ‘Washington Navel I’ (CN 34), during two harvest seasons (2012/2013 and 2013/2014). The following physicochemical variables were quantified: mass, peel color, juice yield, acidity, soluble solids and ratio. The cultivars studied were compared to the commercial cultivar ‘Bahia Cabula’ (CV 25). The new cultivars produced fruit with standards that met consumer expectations, with fruit mass suitable for sale of the fresh fruit, good yield juice and early maturation (March), which enables harvesting ‘Bahia Cabula’ in the off-season period. Thus, it is concluded that there are navel orange cultivars with acceptable physicochemical qualities and early maturation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23313/20476,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Physiological performance of cagaita seeds (Eugenia dysenterica DC.) Subjected to drying,"The present study aimed to determine the imbibition curve and evaluate the effects of ‘reducing the water content of cagaita seeds (Eugenia dysenterica DC.), using the radiographic image analysis technique. To this end, three assays were carried out: seed imbibition curve and root protrusion were determined in assay 1. Seeds in silica gel were oven dried for to 72 h and were then analyzed for water content and vigor in assay 2. Seeds were dried up to certain levels of the water content and were evaluated by radiographic imaging analysis in assay 3. A rapid mass gain was observed in the first 60 imbibition hours and the root protrusion reached 94.4% after 192 imbibition hours. Cagaita seeds did not tolerate drying periods longer than 24 h, which corroborates the recalcitrant behavior of the seeds of these species. The analysis of the radiographic image obtained by an X-ray test allowed the establishment of a direct relation between the increased free space area within the seed and the decrease in the seedling emergence. The drying process altered the internal morphology of the seed and such changes directly influenced the development of the seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22956/20475,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Growth and production of Heliconia under different light conditions,"The use of shading screens of different colors can change the spectral quality of radiation and, as a consequence, the growth and production of crop plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of the growth, yield, and quality of floral stems of Heliconia psittacorum × H. spathocircinata ‘Golden Torch’ grown under different light conditions. The treatments consisted of four conditions: blue photoconversion screens (35%-40%); red photoconversion screens (18%-21%); black shading screens (45%-49%), and full sunlight. The experiment consisted of two parts. In the first, growth was assessed, whereas in the second, aspects related to the production and quality of floral stems were examined. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with split plots in time. Each plot contained six blocks, with 11 replications per block, giving a total of 66 pots per plot. The evaluations were performed at 30-day intervals over a 6-month period. In the analysis of growth, red screens contributed to the growth of the plants, increasing the number of shoots and leaves, and also plant height. The productivity and quality of floral stems was, however, highest in plants grown under blue and black screens. It can be concluded that, under the prevailing experimental conditions, the use of blue screens (35%-40%) and black screens (45%-49%) is suitable for production of the floral stems of ‘Golden Torch’ heliconia.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21877/20665,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Biodegradable polymer nanofiber membrane for the repair of cutaneous wounds in dogs - two case reports,"The study of wound healing and its treatment is extremely important in veterinary medicine due to the high frequency of wounds and the difficulty in treating wounds by second intention. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a nanofiber membrane made of biodegradable polymers as a method of wound treatment in dogs. This study comprised two dogs with bite wounds. Debridement and cleaning was performed followed by the application of the membrane. In one dog, the wound was in the left proximal calcaneal region with clinical signs of infection, necrotic tissue, and muscle and the gastrocnemius tendon were exposed. The wound displayed rapid formation of granulation tissue which became excessive, so it was necessary to debride several times. However, with the suspension of the use of the membrane, formation of this tissue was not observed, and the wound evolved to epithelialization and fast contraction. In the second dog, there was a deep wound on the medial aspect of the proximal right hind limb, with clinical signs of infection, with muscle exposure. Once the membrane was placed, granulation tissue formed, and the membrane was used until the level of this tissue reached the skin. The wound underwent rapid epithelialization and contraction, without developing exuberant granulation tissue. Efficient wound repair was observed and the dogs exhibited greater comfort during application and use of the membrane. More studies should be conducted in dogs focusing on the application of this membrane until the appearance of healthy granulation tissue, as continued use seems to stimulate the formation of exuberant granulation tissue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21612/20071,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Forage intake processes by goats on a massai grass pasture with different sward heights,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the forage-intake process of goats feeding on Massai grass pastures with different heights (40, 50, 60, and 70 cm). The experimental design was completely randomized, with treatments corresponding to four sward heights with two replicates over time and space. Collected data were related to the forage-intake process and the chemical and morphological composition of the pasture. Grazing trials (45 min) were performed with four Anglo-Nubian crossbred goats. Total forage mass intake, bite mass, and intake rate were expressed in relation to animal weight. Pasture density, forage mass, and leaf blade increased as forage height increased. The chemical composition of forage at the evaluated heights was similar, except for reduced crude protein content at 70-cm height. Bite rate, intake rate, and time per bite had a quadratic relationship with increasing sward height. The greatest intake rate was observed at 54.7 cm of height, with 0.136 g DM min-1 kg-1 LW. Bite rate exhibited a linear and positive correlation with increase in intake. At the 50-cm height, goats harvested a mass of 3.65 g DM bite-1 kg-1 LW, when they performed 34.5 bites per minute. Adult goats had a greater forage intake on 50-cm high Massai grass pastures because they could obtain a greater bite mass in a shorter time per bite.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25449/20089,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Thermoregulatory responses of sindhi and guzerat heifers under shade in a tropical environment,"This study characterized the thermal environment and assessed the physiological aspects of acclimatization of Sindhi and Guzerat heifers in a tropical environment (Brazil) under shade. Eight Sindhi and eight Guzerat purebred heifers (Bos indicus) had their physiological traits measured twice a day (9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.). Environmental data during the experimental period were collected at two-hour intervals between 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. The temperature-humidity (THI) and the black globe temperature-humidity (BGHI) indices were calculated, and surface temperature (St), respiratory rate (Rr), and rectal temperature (Rt) were collected, being used to estimate heat loss by cutaneous (Ec) and respiratory (Er) evaporation. In the warmer parts of the day (1:00 and 3:00 p.m.), the THI and BGHI reached values of 80.26 and 81.25, respectively. There was no significant difference in rectal temperatures between the breeds, but higher values were observed in the afternoon. Heat transfer by cutaneous evaporation reached 118.71±12.91 W.m-2 and 103.43±6.82 W.m-2 at 2:00 p.m. for the Sindhi and Guzerat heifers, respectively. Under these conditions (air temperature was between 29 and 30°C), 84% of the total latent heat loss in Sindhi and Guzerat heifers was represented by Ec. It can be concluded that Sindhi and Guzerat heifers can maintain homeothermy with minimal thermoregulatory effort under shade conditions in a tropical environment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25347/20137,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Productive characteristics of meat quails reared in different environments,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ambient temperature and consumption on the performance, carcass yields and cuts, organs, and body temperatures of meat quails. The experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Maranhão, campus of Chapadinha-MA, during September to October 2013. From the 14th day of age, 450 meat quails, not sexed, with an average initial weight of 90.4 ± 12.9 g, were distributed in batteries and accommodated in either acclimatized or non-acclimatized rooms, until 42 days of age. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three treatments, and six replicates of 25 birds each. The treatments were CE (acclimatized environment at 26 °C); NE (natural environment), and CECC (acclimatized environment at 26 °C with controlled feed, to keep the same consumption level as that of the birds in NE). The evaluated variables at 28 and 42 days of age were as follows: (1) the intake of feed, weight gain, feed conversion, body weight, and energy efficiency to weight gain, (2) the carcass weight, carcass yields (%) for breast, thigh, drumstick, and wing, and (3) the relative weights (%) of the digestive tract, heart, liver, gizzard, and intestine. In addition, we evaluated the cloacal and surface temperatures (°C), and subsequently, calculated the average and surface body temperatures. The treatment means were compared using the Student-Newman-Keuls test, with 5% level of significance. Compared with the acclimatized ambient environment, the natural environment more favored the performance of quails up to 28 days, but then affected it negatively from that age onward. Carcass yield, organs, and internal temperature of the quails maintained in the acclimatized and natural environments were not influenced.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25208/20087,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Twenty-eight Nellore heifers with an average initial weight of 240.9 kg were used in this experiment. All heifers received the same dietary management, in an intensive rearing system, with mineral salt and water ad libitum. Heifers were distributed, in a completely randomized design, into two treatments (with and without progesterone ear implant) with seven replications, in 14 stalls. Analysis of variance was performed, and, for non-parametric variables, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. Parameters referring to the meat quantitative and qualitative characteristics, represented by the weight and yield of the carcass, conformation, marbling, color, meat texture, carcass morphometric measurements, longissimus dorsi muscle area, and fat thickness, were not affected by the progesterone hormone. The use of the progesterone ear implant did not change the carcass physical characteristics or the meat quality characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25131/20084,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of concentrate levels in diet and body biotypes on productive variables of Guzera beef cattle,"The goal of this study was evaluate diets (50 or 80% of concentrate) and body biotypes (late or early) on performance, behavior, carcass condition, meat quality, and feed cost estimates in feedlot finishing Guzera beef cattle. Use of concentrates in the diet may improve performance and carcass fat scores in ruminant animals, but Guzera beef cattle may be more efficient in forage conversion, which directly influences the economic viability of the production system. We evaluated 32 non-castrated male Guzera beef cattle at 32±2 months of age. The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and six replicates in a 2 × 2 factorial design (2 diets × 2 body biotypes). Initial and final body weights were 459.4±31.2 kg and 566.7±40.8 kg, respectively. There was no change (P > 0.05) in dry matter intake, feed conversion, or daily weight gain when the concentrate in the diet was increased to 80%. Animals fed a diet with 80% of concentrate spent less time (P < 0.05) ruminating (17.8±6.3 vs. 6.3±2.7% of the assessed time). Body biotype did not alter the variables. The rise from 50 to 80% in the proportion of dietary concentrate increased carcass fat, with positive returns in the production process, even given the reduction in rumination, which can lead to poor welfare of animals consuming 80% of dietary concentrate. Body biotype did not affect the variables studied, but it is worth emphasizing that the age at slaughter of these animals probably influenced this result. Thus, selection of the best diet should be based on feeding cost, and in accordance with the cost estimated in this study, the diet with 80% of concentrate is the most suitable for feedlot finished Guzera beef cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25148/20085,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four periods (63, 84, 105 and 126 days), each with three replications. The time spent daily by animals on grazing, idle, rumination and in the trough was not affected by periods of sealing the pastures, with mean values of 566.6; 422.29; 426.9 and 24.1 minutes, respectively. The number of feeding stations, the time spent in the stations and the number of feeding stations per minute were not different between periods of sealing the pastures, averaging 106.4; 34.6 and 3.0, respectively. The number of bites and the number of bites per minute showed a quadratic effect, with a point of maximum equal to 1,098 bites and 31 bites per minute, observed on days 93 and 88, respectively. Feed efficiency was linearly decreasing influenced by periods of sealing the pastures. Periods of grazing and idle, the number of bites, the number of bites per minute and feed efficiency are influenced by different deferral periods of pastures under the conditions of this study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25014/20082,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Eight cows (degree of blood ½ to ¾ Holstein x Zebu), with previous average production of 3000-4000 kg adjusted to 300 days of lactation and average body weight of 465.16 kg ± 65.45 kg were distributed in two 4 x 4 Latin squares. The behavior was assessed every five minutes for 24 hours on the 21st day of each period. The results were tested by analysis of variance and regression at p < 0.05 probability. The time spent in grazing, rumination, idle and in the trough; total chewing time, number of cuds per day, chewing per day; chewing per cud; the number of periods of grazing, rumination, idle and in the trough; time spent by period of grazing, rumination, idle and in the trough were not different between treatments. The feed efficiency (g DM h-1; g NDFa h-1 and g TDN h-1) and time spent per cud ruminated TSR sec cud-1) were linearly reduced. It is recommended to include up to 10% castor meal treated with Ca (OH)2 in the total diet.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24594/20080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Growing and finishing crossbred feedlot ewe lambs fed with increasing levels of concentrate in the diet,"To maximize economic gain in sheep production systems it is critical to adjust feedlot diets to maximize performance while minimizing feed, and especially concentrate, waste. Little information is available on ideal diets for crossbred ewe lambs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of feedlot crossbred ewe lambs, and the digestibility of diets, with increasing levels of concentrate during the growing and finishing phases. Twenty-four crossbred Texel × Pantaneira Texel ewe lambs were confined and fed Tifton hay with increasing levels of concentrate in the diet (20, 40, 60 and 80%) for individual evaluation of dry matter intake (DMI), digestibility of diets, average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FE). Animals were slaughtered at 47 kg. In the growing phase, the inclusion of concentrate in the diets (1176 g.kg-1) did not change DMI (p > 0.05). Concentrate levels had a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) on the dry matter digestibility coefficient (DMDC) and on total digestible nutrients (TDN) during the growing phase. In the finishing phase, there was a negative linear effect of concentrate levels on DMI (p < 0.05), but TDN intake was similar among the experimental diets (p > 0.05). DMDC and TDN values displayed a quadratic behavior (p < 0.05), plateauing at 60% concentrate. ADG and FE increased as concentrate was added to the diet in the growing phase (p < 0.05). During the finishing phase, lamb performance was similar (p > 0.05) for different diets. Thus, the use of 60% concentrate in the confined crossbred ewe lamb diet during growing and 20% concentrate during finishing is recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24586/20095,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carcass characteristics of purebred and crossbred Nellore females fed solely pasture,"This research aimed to compare carcasses of purebred and crossbred Nellore females reared uniquely on pasture (Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu). Breeds assessed consisted of purebred Nellore (16) and Nellore x Santa Gertrudis crossbred (16), being 32 ± 1.5 months old. All animals were slaughtered as they reached 450 kg. Crossbred females showed higher slaughter, hot and cold carcass weights and longer lengths (P < 0.05). Conversely, purebred animals attained greater carcass yields (P < 0.05). Nonetheless, crossbred females had higher primal cut weights and plate/ flank percentage (P < 0.05). Also, non-carcass components as kidneys, liver, kidney-pelvic-heart fat showed higher weights for crossbred females (P < 0.05). Thus, regarding beef cattle reared and finished exclusively on grazing areas, crossbred females (Nellore x Santa Gertrudis) may be the most profitable ones for cattle raisers, since they produce heavier slaughtering carcasses. Notwithstanding, they might be interesting for meat industry, for yielding more in prime cuts than purebreds, even if raised at the same conditions and slaughtered at same age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23772/20075,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of technical indexes on cost-effectiveness in dairy farms participating in the “Balde Cheio” program at different stages of production,"This study assesses the effects of technical and managerial indexes on the cost-effectiveness of 20 demonstration units (DUs) that participated in the “Full Bucket” (“Balde Cheio”) program, at different stages of production, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, from January to December 2011. Here, cost-effectiveness was assessed by considering gross margin, net margin, result (financial profit or loss), cost-effectiveness, and profitability as indicators of financial efficiency. Data were analyzed using PASW 18.0. A multiple linear regression model was used with the stepwise method to identify the managerial, technical, and other indexes that most affected profitability and cost-effectiveness. The production systems were categorized into three production levels: small (nine DUs), medium (nine DUs), or large (two DUs). The managerial and technical indexes differed according to the stages of production under study. The daily milk production for the three categories were below 151 kg, 151 to 400 kg, and above 400 kg, respectively. The best profitability and cost-effectiveness at the large production level resulted from selling livestock. This level showed greater animal/day productivity (kg of milk), the best cows/farm manpower ratio, and the best number of herd animals/farm manpower ratio, whereas the medium level showed a lower fixed cost/total cost relation. The small production level showed the best percentages of lactating cows, cows in the herd, and lactating cows in the herd, as well as the best productivity/ha/year and lactating cows/ha. However, the latter results were not sufficient to generate a profit, owing to the small scale of production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24515/20077,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Ensiling of elephant grass with soybean hulls or rice bran,"The goal was to evaluate the chemical composition and fermentation pattern of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Roxo) silage with different levels of soybean hulls or rice bran. Two trials were conducted, comprising of a completely randomized design, with four replicates each. Treatments consisted on the addition of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of soybean hulls or rice bran to unwilted green elephant grass forage. Large PVC silos were used adopting a density of 600 kg of green mass m-3. The silos were opened 40 days after ensiling. The results revealed that the inclusion of 10% soybean hulls increased elephant grass forage dry matter (DM) content to 31%, but did not alter the water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content or buffering capacity. The resultant silages exhibited good fermentation patterns in terms of pH (less than 3.97) and NH3-N (4.07% total N) levels. The inclusion of rice bran increased both DM and WSC content in the forage, improving the fermentation pattern of silages (P < 0.05). This too was verified by a pH lower than 3.92 and a maximum NH3-N of 4.23% of the total N. The inclusion of 10% rice bran to the elephant grass improved the nutritional value of the forage to be ensiled and, hence, of the produced silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20464/20074,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Prevention and control of bovine cysticercosis: a Delphi study,"Bovine cysticercosis is a zoonotic parasitic infection caused by the larval stage (Cysticercus bovis) of Taenia saginata. This study aimed to identify prevention and control measures for bovine cysticercosis indicated by experts in the fields of public and animal health. The study was conducted through three rounds of the Delphi method and had the participation of 44 experts from 13 Brazilian states in 30 educational institutions, research institutions, and sanitary inspection services. The first round comprised an open question, the answers to which formed the basis for structuring the second and third questionnaire. To reach a consensus in the second and third rounds, experts were asked to express their agreement or disagreement of each proposition on the questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed at the end of each round. Twenty-three specialists (52.27%) participated in all three rounds. The first round resulted in 28 proposals categorized into six areas: health education, methods of diagnosis and treatment, sanitation measures, epidemiological studies, legislation and sanitary supervision, and intersectorality. In the second round, the experts reached a consensus on 16 propositions (57.14%). This percentage increased by 3.54% during the third round. At the end of the third round, the experts had reached a consensus on 17 of the 28 initial propositions (60.71%). The highest percentage of agreement (29.4%) was observed in the category of health education. This study allowed us to identify 17 recommendations pertaining to the prevention and control of bovine cysticercosis. These measures are not mutually exclusive, and require an integrated approach to the establishment of intervention actions at various points in the life cycle of the parasite.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23839/20066,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of pregnancy rates of Bos indicus cows subjected to different synchronization ovulation protocols using injectable progesterone or an intravaginal device,"This study evaluated the pregnancy rate in Nelore cows (Bos indicus) that were subjected to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) using different protocols consisting of injectable progesterone (P4) or an intravaginal device (impregnated with P4). Multiparous cows 72-84 months in age, 30-45 days postpartum, were selected on the basis of the absence of a corpus luteum (CL) and follicles < 8 mm after transrectal palpation and ultrasound examinations. On a random day of the estrus cycle (D0), the selected animals (n = 135) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (n = 45 each). Group I (injectable P4/FTAI 36 hours) received 250 mg of injectable P4 and 2 mg EB on D0; on D7, they received 500 µg of cloprostenol; on D8, 300 IU of eCG and 1 mg of EB were administered; and finally, FTAI was performed 36 hours after the application of EB. Group II (injectable P4/FTAI 48 hours) received the same protocol as Group I, except that the FTAI was performed 48 hours after ovulation induction. The animals of Group III (Control/CIDR) received a conventional protocol for FTAI using an intravaginal device (D0: P4 and 2 mg EB; D8: device removal, 500 µg cloprostenol, 300 IU eCG, 1 mg EB; and FTAI performed 48 hours after removal of the device). The results showed that cows synchronized with the conventional protocol for FTAI (Control/CIDR) had a higher pregnancy rate (60 %, 27/45) than those synchronized with an injectable P4/FTAI 36 hours (33.33 %; 15/45, P = 0.010). However, the group receiving injectable P4 group/FTAI 48 hours had a similar pregnancy rate (48.9 %; 22/45; P = 0.290) when compared to both the group receiving the conventional protocol and that receiving injectable P4/FTAI 36 hours (P = 0.134). Although the injectable P4 may affect pregnancy rate with the FTAI performed in 36 hours, we found similar pregnancy rates from cows inseminated 48 hours after induction ovulation, considering injectable or intravaginal P4. Therefore, we suggest that injectable P4 represents an alternative source of progesterone for synchronization of cattle for FTAI.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23973/20067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Assessment of the healing of standardized wounds in rabbits treated serially with autologous platelet-rich plasma gel,"Recent studies have been carried out to evaluate the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the cicatrization of wounds; however, the protocols for treatment have been based on a single application of PRP.To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma in gel form on the cicatrization of cutaneous wounds in vivo experimental model, wounds were induced in the dorsal areas of six New Zealand white rabbits with the aid of an 8-mm punch. The right side was used as a control (A) and treated with 0.9% NaCl, whereas the left side (B) was treated serially with the autologous platelet-rich plasma gel. Lesions were assessed over a 17-day period. At days 0, 10 and 17, the animals were evaluated and morphological and morphometric analyses of the wounds were performed. At day 17, a biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation. Macroscopically, wounds treated with PRP showed better cicatrization and higher contraction percentages than the control wounds. Regarding the percentage of wound contraction, it was found that the average treated wound with autologous platelet-rich plasma gelwas 95% while withthecontrolwas88%. We concluded that autologous platelet-rich plasma gel is effective and accelerates cicatrization when used serially in short intervals, thus confirming its therapeutic potential in cutaneous lesions and potential as an alternative wound treatment option.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23823/20065,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Epidemiological analysis of infection by the bovine viral diarrhea virus on family farms in Brazil,"The aim of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of infection by the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) on family farms, as well as to study the risk factors associated with the infection. In total, 319 blood serum samples were collected from cattle, of reproductive age (>24 months) in 24 herds from 11 cities of the brejo microregion in Pernambuco. The samples were subjected to the seroneutralization test to detect anti-BVDV antibodies. In order to identify the risk factors associated with the BVDV, a questionnaire epidemiologic was applied and followed by statistical analysis of logistic regression, with the serological test considered as the dependent variable (reagent or non-reagent). A prevalence of 51.1% (163/319; C.I. 45.5% - 56.7%) was found in the present study. Of the 24 herds sampled, 100.0% contained at least one reagent animal. The prevalence in the counties ranged from 23.1% to 70.0%. The following risk factors were identified in the present study: not providing colostrum (OR 3.85; p=0.018); disease unknown (OR 2.54; p=0.001) and consortium breeding (OR 1.76; p=0.013). Based on these results, it was clear that BVDV infection is widespread in herds on family farms in the microregion studied herein. Health education policies must be implemented for producers and professionals who provide technical assistance. In addition, based on the risk factors identified in the present study, hygiene-sanitary measures should be implemented in order to reduce the prevalence of the BVDV.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23792/20064,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Ultrasonographic findings of the mammary gland, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys in transgenic goats for hG-CSF during induced lactation","In transgenic murine models, the study of certain organs or tissues can be performed after euthanasia of some specimens. However, this practice may not be economically feasible when applied to livestock such as transgenic goats. It is necessary to use minimally invasive methods to perform in vivo studies of organs that may be affected by disorders related to the activity of the transgene, particularly during milk production, when the recombinant protein is secreted. The aim of this study was to describe ultrasonographic findings of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and mammary glands in transgenic goats for evaluating the effect of human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (hG-CSF) expression in milk during induced lactation. Six female Canindé goats-three transgenic (T) and three non-transgenic (NT)-were subjected to hormone therapy to induce lactation; ultrasonographic examinations of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and mammary gland were performed during both the hormonal therapy and the lactation period at different intervals depending on the organ being examined. On Day 16 (Day 1 = hormonal therapy initiation), all goats were lactating and presented healthy mammary glands, characterized by echogenic parenchyma showing a granular echotexture. Transgenic and non-transgenic goats were compared on the basis of measurements and ultrasound images obtained from each organ. No differences between T and NT animals were observed in the examined area for the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys. Liver and renal echogenicity and appearance of gallbladder and portal and hepatic veins were similar in all females. Ultrasonographic findings of the mammary gland, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys in transgenic goats did not show any difference from those in non-transgenic goats.Thus, these results suggest that the presence and expression of the transgene had no effect on the ultrasonographic findings of mammary gland and abdominal organs in the transgenic goats. Moreover, the findings shows that ultrasonography is a useful screening tool for clinical examination of transgenic goats; this allows the investigation of possible disorders and avoids the unnecessary use of invasive techniques.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23744/20063,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,"Seroepidemiology of Leishmania infantum in dogs in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Leishmaniosis are zoonoses that present several clinical manifestations in humans and have dogs as their main reservoir in the urban environment. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the parasitosis and has been increasing in Brazil, despite the actions of public health agencies. Until 2002, the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) was considered free of human and canine leishmaniasis. The first human case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in RS was recorded in 2003. In 2009, the first autochthonous cases of human VL and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were confirmed in São Borja, RS, and the occurrence of the insect vector was recorded for the first time in the state. In 2010, the first confirmed case of CVL was reported and seropositive dogs were identified in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. Given the importance of this zoonosis and the difficulties of a reliable diagnosis in dogs, this study aimed to identify epidemiological aspects of CVL in dogs in an area of Porto Alegre where cases of the disease have been reported. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from dogs in this area, which were then tested by the methods of RT-DPP® and ELISA for diagnosis of Leishmania infantum. An epidemiological questionnaire was completed by dog owners, containing aspects related to care of the animals, characteristics of their environment, and their living conditions. We observed that 83% (250/300) of the studied dogs were of mixed breed, 58% (175/300) were female, 78% (238/300) slept outdoors, and 61% (183/300) shared their living quarters with other species. Clinically, we observed that 90% (270/300) of the animals were infested by ectoparasites, 70% (210/300) had dermatopathies, 24% (72/300) presented weight loss and anorexia, and 22% (65/300) had ocular disorders. The results of the two serological tests were 100% concordant for the three seropositive samples (1%), and the remaining 297 (99%) were negative for both tests. We conclude that despite the low prevalence of L. infantum seropositive dogs, conditions in the region are favorable for CVL transmission, creating a risk of VL for the human population in the city of Porto Alegre.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21808/20098,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effects of epidural anesthesia with tramadol, ropivacaine or tramadol-ropivacaine combination, in bitches undergoing ovariohysterectomy under anesthesia with isoflurane","Epidural anesthesia is a locoregional anesthetic technique that provides analgesia and muscle relaxation in the-retroumbilical region. The combination of opioids and local anesthetics increased the intensity and duration of analgesia by causing immediate motor and sensory nerve blockade, and improved recovery after surgery. The objective was to comparatively evaluate the trans- and postoperative cardiorespiratory and analgesic effects of epidurally administered tramadol, ropivacaine and tramadol-ropivacaine combination in dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy. The effect of isoflurane concentration was also evaluated. This study was performed on 24 female mongrel dogs, pre-medicated with chlorpromazine (0.5 mg kg-1, IV) and, anesthetized with propofol and isoflurane. The dogs were randomly divided into three groups. The first group receveid epidural tramadol (2 mg kg-1, GT group), the second group received ropivacaine (1.5 mg kg-1, GR group), and the third group received a tramadol-ropivacaine combination at the above-mentioned doses (GTR group). At pre-defined time points, classified into pre-, trans-, and postoperative periods, cardiorespiratory variables and analgesia were analyzed for a period of up to 420 min following epidural anesthesia. The check analgesia was check of approximately 105, 217 and 382 minutes, in GR, in GT and GTR respectively, and no cardiovascular and respiratory depression. The drugs used in this study are considered safe and effective for ovariohysterectomy due to the cardiorespiratory stability and trans-operative analgesia provided by them. However, the combination of ropivacaine and tramadol ensured a greater reduction in the inhaled anesthetic dose and better analgesia during in the postoperative period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20911/20059,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological and microbiological aspects of residential outbreaks of foodborne illness in the Parana State, Brazil","Foodborne illness results in high costs to public health and the food chain production worldwide. The majority of the population is unaware of food safety requirements and consequently, domestic kitchens are sources of contamination and spread of disease. Eating habits and the profile of food handlers in these sites guide the planning of surveillance and public education. This study describes the epidemiological and microbiological aspects of household outbreaks of foodborne illness in the State of Parana, using the Notifiable Diseases Information System database. There were 357 outbreaks between 2008 and 2012 in the State of Parana, and households were the main place of occurrence (43.70%), followed by restaurants and bakeries (21.00%), and kindergartens and schools (11.20 %). Household outbreak records derived from the municipalities for regional health coverage, based in Curitiba, Cascavel, Pato Branco, Foz do Iguaçu and Londrina. These indicated an increased number of reported cases between 2011 and 2012. The increase in reporting reflects a greater awareness among professionals because of training. The results highlight the consumption of contaminated food (36.15%), by strains of coagulase positive Staphylococcus (36.23%). They also reflect an intensification and wholeness of public policies on the education of the population regarding hygiene principles in the acquisition, handling, preparation, storage, and consumption of food in the household.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23667/20058,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Influence of maturity stage on fruit longevity of cherry tomatoes stored at ambient and controlled temperature,"Fruit maturity stage has direct influence on the post-harvest life and consumer quality. Therefore, the understanding of the maturation process and its quality characteristics for storage are key factors for commercialization. In face of the foregoing, this study aimed to determine shelf life and changes in physical and chemical indexes of cherry tomatoes (Perinha Água Branca (PAB) and Mascot), assessing fruit harvested at four maturity stages and stored at ambient and controlled temperatures. For this, it was used fruit at turning, pink, red and ripe maturity stages, submitted to ambient (25 ± 2 °C) and controlled (12 °C and 90% RH) temperature, and assessed over time the indexes of fresh mass loss, titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids and ascorbic acid. The experimental design was completely randomized design in a factorial scheme of 2×4×7 for ambient temperature and 2×4×8 for controlled temperature. At ambient temperature, a longevity of up to 20 days was observed for PAB and Mascot fruit harvested at turning and pink maturity stages. When harvested at red and ripe stages, the longevity was of 15 days for PAB fruit and of 15 and 11 days, respectively, for Mascot fruit. At controlled temperature, PAB fruit showed longevity of 24 days when harvested at turning and pink stages and of 20 and 7 days, respectively, when harvested at red and ripe stages. A longevity of up to 27 days was observed for Mascot fruit harvested at turning stage and of 24 days for the other stages.

1,1978,Factors affecting clay dispersion in oxisols treated with vinasse,"Vinasse is a potassium-rich waste generated in large amounts by the ethanol production that, applied in the soil, can promote changes in water dispersible clay and in its physical quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clay dispersion of Oxisols after vinasse application and correlate it with some chemical attributes. Samples were collected in two Oxisols (155 and 471 g of clay kg-1), put in pots, received dosages of vinasse (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 m3 ha-1) and remained incubated during 120 days. Phosphorous, organic carbon, pH H2O, pH KCl, pH CaCl2, Al3+, H+Al3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Delta pH and the proportion between monovalent and bivalent cations have been evaluated and correlated with the clay flocculation degree. Vinasse changed almost all chemical variables in both soils and increased the flocculation in the sandy soil, but did not change the clayey one. Delta pH, Mg2+ and K+ significantly correlated with the flocculation degree in the sandy soil. It is possible to conclude that the dispersive effect of K+ added by vinasse are irrelevant, considering the flocculant effect caused by the increment in Mg2+ and Delta pH after vinasse application.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26487/20049,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Characterization and sensory preference of fermented dairy beverages prepared with different concentrations of whey and araticum pulp,"The objective of this study was to develop a fermented dairy beverage flavored with araticum pulp, assess its physicochemical characteristics, microbiological quality, and sensory preference by the consumer. Araticum pulp was prepared using two different methods: with or without bleaching (50 ºC/5 minutes). Formulations of fermented dairy beverages consisting of whey (50%), standardized pasteurized milk (50%), and seven different concentrations of bleached araticum pulp (5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, and 20.0% w/v) were prepared. In addition, seven formulations of fermented dairy beverage, without adding araticum pulp, and consisting of varying proportions of whey (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100%) were developed. In all formulations, thickeners/stabilizers were added. All araticum pulp samples (with and without bleach) and fermented dairy beverages (with and without araticum pulp) were analyzed for the relevant physicochemical properties: pH, titratable acidity, acidity of pulp, acidity of fermented beverage, moisture, ash, fat, protein, crude fiber, ascorbic acid, carbohydrates, total solids, and caloric values. Microbiological counts of coliforms at 35 °C and 45 °C in the pulp and beverage, and molds and yeasts and Salmonella sp. in the pulp were obtained. Additionally, sensory analysis regarding preferences of the different fermented dairy beverage formulations was also performed. The araticum pulp samples without bleach, showed higher values of pH, moisture, protein, total fiber, and ascorbic acid, as compared to bleached pulp samples, while bleached araticum pulp showed higher values for other physicochemical parameters. Microbiological results showed that all pulps and fruit-dairy beverages were suitable for consumption. It was found that there was no significant consumer preference between different fermented beverage formulations, according to the different percentages of pulp.

1,1978,Determination of the adaptability and stability of soybean cultivars in different locations and at different sowing times in Paraná state using the AMMI and Eberhart and Russel methods,"This study aimed to evaluate the adaptability and phenotypic stability of 10 soybean genotypes in 12 environments in Paraná state by using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis (AMMI) and Eberhart and Russell models. The assays were conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates, in the 2010/2011 season in four locations in Paraná state (Assaí, São Pedro do Ivaí, Cornélio Procópio, and Marilândia do Sul), and with three sowing dates (15/-20/10/10; 29/10-03/11/10; 15/-20/11/10). The cultivars tested with Roundup Ready® technology included SYN 1049, SYN 1152, SYN 1059, SYN 3358, SYN 1163, SYN 1157, V-MAX, FT Campo Mourão, BMX Potência, and SYN 9070. The yield character was analyzed. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and the adaptability and stability were then analyzed. The results of the AMMI and Eberhart and Russell models were somewhat consistent for the stability parameter only. The AMMI analysis was able to capture 66% of the variance associated with residue no additives, of which 43.18% was retained in the first principal component of interaction and 23.58%, in the second component. This is sufficient to explain the genotype × environment interaction. The SYN 1059, SYN 1163, and VMAX genotypes are distinguished by their considerably higher yield and productive adaptation. In the AMMI analysis, the cultivar SYN 1163 showed commercial promise among the other cultivars for high grain yield performance, adaptation, and response predictability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24479/20047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,The use of various strains of Rhizobium tropici for inoculation of snap bean cultivars with a determinate growth pattern,"The snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an economically important vegetable in Brazil. Bean plants can establish symbiotic associations with bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen. These associations show specificity of host plants to certain bacteria. Nitrogen fertilization constitutes a crop production cost, and the use of Rhizobium inoculation to supply nitrogen to crops may decrease the production costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of inoculation of three different snap bean cultivars with three Rhizobium tropici strains on agronomical performance of the plant. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with a 3 ? 5 factorial scheme and four replicates per treatment. The factors tested were three snap bean cultivars (UEL 1, Alessa, and UEL 2), and five types of inoculation (uninoculated control, inoculation with SEMIA 4077, SEMIA 4080, SEMIA 4088, or with a mix of the three strains). The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. Plant height, stem diameter, pod length, the number of pods per plant, and average weight and yield of commercial-grade pods, were determined. An analysis of variance was conducted using the F test, followed by Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Inoculation had a positive effect on all the parameters quantified. The beneficial effect was more pronounced in plants inoculated with the mix of Rhizobium strains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23781/20102,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,The plant stimulant humic acid extracted from organic waste recycled by composting combined with liming and fertilization,"The disposal of organic waste can be an environmental problem; on the other hand, this waste can be the raw material for the production of biostimulants, among other recycling processes. The objective of this study was to recycle waste bovine manure and poultry litter through composting and isolate its humic acids in order to test their use, in the presence and absence of liming and fertilization, on corn plants as indicators. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. The experimental unit was a vase of 1 dm3 filled with soil that received treatments generated by the combination of the factors under study: humic acids via seed, liming, and fertilization. After thirty days of the experiment, growth characteristics were measured to estimate the initial performance of the indicator corn plants in response to the treatments. The results showed that the combination of chemical fertilization with humic acids extracted from organic compounds increased the plants development. In conclusion, the use of biostimulants based on humic substances is positive and complementary to fertilizers used in agriculture, forming a superior combination. Such use is also recommended because it allows for the recycling of organic waste via composting, as well as the preparation of biostimulants for added technical, and potentially economic, value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23602/20045,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Silicon does not alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress in soybean plants,"Beneficial effects of silicon (Si) in the plants growth under conditions of drought stress have been associated with to uptake and accumulation ability of element by different species. However, the effects of Si on soybean under water stress are still incipient and inconclusive. This study investigated the effect of Si application as a way to confer greater soybean tolerance to drought stress. The experiment was carried out in 20-L pots under greenhouse conditions. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in a 2 × 4 factorial: two water regimes (no stress or water stress) and four Si rates (0, 50, 100 and 200 mg kg–1). Soybean plants were grown until beginning flowering (R1) growth stage with soil moisture content near at the field capacity, and then it started the differentiation of treatments under drought by the suspension of water supply. Changes in relative water content (RWC) in leaf, electrolyte leakage from cells, peroxidase activity, plant nutrition and growth were measured after 7 days of drought stress and 3 days recovery. The RWC in soybean leaves decreased with Si rates in the soil. Silicon supply in soil with average content of this element, reduced dry matter production of soybean under well-irrigated conditions and caused no effect on dry matter under drought stress. The nitrogen uptake by soybean plants is reduced with the Si application under drought stress. The results indicated that the Si application stimulated the defense mechanisms of soybean plants, but was not sufficient to mitigate the negative effects of drought stress on the RWC and dry matter production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23530/20044,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Phosphorus fractions and correlation with soil attributes in a chronosequence of agricultural under no-tillage,"In no-tillage (NT) soils, changes in the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) have been observed over time. These changes can interfere with the dynamics of P in surface soil layers. Thus, the objectives of this study were: to evaluate the organic and inorganic fractions of P and their degree of lability (labile, moderately labile, and moderately recalcitrant) in an Oxisol under NT for 6 years (NT6), 14 years (NT14), and 22 years (NT22) and cultivated with a succession of soybean and corn/wheat. The fractions were evaluated for 16 years of NT, with the last four years under integrated corn second crop and Brachiaria (NT16+B). We also analyzed an area of native forest, as well as analyzing the correlations between the results of the P fractions of these areas with other attributes such as total carbon content, vegetable waste deposited on the ground, phosphorus and humic fractions remaining in SOM. From each of the areas, samples were collected at 0.00-0.05 m and 0.05-0.10 m. A completely randomized design with 5 replicates was used. Management of phosphorus fertilization and SOM following adoption of the SPD of time (6 to 22 years) increased the levels of all fractions of inorganic P (0.0 to 0.10 m), as well as the fractions of labile (0.05-0.10 m), moderately labile (0.0-0.10 m), and moderately recalcitrant (0.05-0.10 m) organic phosphorus. The correlation matrix shows interactions between the evaluated soil attributes, especially between inorganic phosphorus fractions and fulvic and humic acids and between the moderately recalcitrant organic phosphorus and humin fraction.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23395/20054,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Growth, yield, and postharvest quality in eggplant produced under different foliar fertilizer (Spirulina platensis) treatments","This study evaluated the growth, yield, and postharvest quality of eggplant grown under different foliar fertilizer treatments with Spirufert® (Spirulina platensis). The treatments consisted of four fertilizer concentrations applied at four phenological stages: M1 (10, 15, 25, and 35 g L-1), M2 (15, 20, 30, and 40 g L-1), M3 (20, 25, 35, and 45 g L-1), and M4 (control plants, water spraying only). For Postharvest experiments were conducted in a 4 x 5 factorial design corresponding to the four treatments in the field experiment and five storage times. Spirufert® applied at lower concentrations (M1) resulted in greater fruit yield without affecting the foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na. Higher fertilizer concentrations (M3) increased vegetative growth but reduced eggplant yield. Fruit color parameters and soluble solids contents were not affected by fertilizer application, but pulp firmness was more stable in M1 fruits stored for up to six days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23335/20043,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Effect of the interaction between fungicide application time and rainfall simulation interval on Asian Soybean Rust control effectiveness,"Environmental factors affect the performance of fungicides in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). They also influence the residual activity of the products applied to the leaves. The objective of this study was to assess the control effectiveness of the interaction between fungicide application and rainfall simulation on Asian Soybean Rust (ASR). Two experiments were conducted, one in the greenhouse, in a completely randomized design, and the other in the field, in a randomized block design. Both the experiments had the same factorial arrangement of 6x5, with four replications. Factor A: Five fungicide applications time at 0400 h, 0900 h, 1400 h, 1800 h, 2300 h and, a control with no application; Factor B: four intervals of time between the application of fungicide and rainfall simulation at 0, 30, 60 and 120 min for the experiment in the greenhouse and at 2, 30, 60, 120 min for the experiment in the field. A control was included for both the experiments with no rainfall. The number of days to the appearance of the first pustules was determined, along with severity of ASR, relative chlorophyll index and productivity. It was found that the ASR control effectiveness of fungicide applications in soybean plants in sunlight was less efficient with rainfall simulation. The rainfall simulation had greater negative effect on disease control effectiveness in applications conducted at night under dew conditions. The application conducted at 0900 h showed the greatest disease control effectiveness in both greenhouse and in the field conditions. The 1400 h application showed decreased fungicide control residual and ASR control effectiveness, possibly due to a combination of the low relative humidity and high temperature. Rainfall simulation carried out at 120 min after application still had the ability to affect the ASR control effectiveness.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23315/20042,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of drying on the physical properties of adzuki bean,"The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of drying on the physical properties of adzuki bean (Vigna angularis Willd.). Adzuki beans with moisture content of 47.9% were dried in a oven with forced air ventilation at temperatures of 40, 60 and 80 °C and relative humidity of 18.5, 8.6, and 3.8%, respectively, until the moisture content reached 12.9%. We used 15 adzuki beans individualised in aluminium capsules. The orthogonal axes of the beans (length, width, and thickness) were measured at intervals of five percentage points during the reduction of moisture content. The parameters determined were: sphericity; circularity; volume of beans; volumetric contraction index; volume contraction percentage; surface area; projected area; and surface-volume ratio. The drying conditions altered the physical properties of adzuki bean. As a result of moisture content reduction, there was increased sphericity and surface-volume ratio, and decreased volume, unitary volumetric contraction, surface area, and projected area. Circularity was not influenced by the drying temperatures within the range of moisture content analysed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23277/20490,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physiological quality of the seeds of common bean cultivars grown in different phosphorus levels and growing seasons,"The use of appropriate management practices, such as sowing and fertilizing, associated with the use of promising genotypes are strategies for obtaining bean seeds of high quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological quality of cultivars of common bean seeds produced in two growing seasons under different phosphorus levels. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial design of 2 × 2 × 6, with four replications. We evaluated two common bean cultivars (‘IAC Carioca Precoce’ and ‘IAC Carioca Tybatã’), two planting seasons of common beans (rainy season and dry season), and six rates of phosphorus fertilization (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 kg ha-1 of P2O5) applied to the planting rows, using triple super phosphate as the source of P. Seed quality was evaluated by testing the water content, germination, first account of the germination test, accelerated aging test and the water content after the test, electrical conductivity, and seedling emergence in the field. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means of cultivars and growing seasons were compared using Tukey’s test at 5% probability. Regression analysis was performed for phosphorus levels. Seeds of ‘IAC Carioca Precoce’ produced during the rainy season showed higher germination. In the dry season, the highest seedling emergence in the field was recorded for ‘IAC Carioca Tybatã’. Common bean cultivation provided seeds with higher germination and vigor in the dry season than in the rainy season. The accelerated aging test showed that when phosphorus was applied in the planting rows, the vigor of common bean seed was enhanced, with a better response to higher doses when cultivated in the dry season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23001/20039,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Producing randomness between plots in pepper and snap bean experiments,"It is important to know the production variability among experimental plots in a protected environment because this information reduces error and increases the reliability of the results. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the spatial independence of fruit yield between plots of peppers and snap beans. Data on production uniformity were gathered from trials performed at the Department of Plant Science, Federal University of Santa Maria. Different plots sizes were created according to the number of plants in the crop row. To verify the randomness of the data distribution, we applied a sequence test between the plots within one line for individual and combined harvests. The use of ten plants per plot in experiments with peppers led to no randomness within the lines during the production of fruit fresh biomass. In experiments with snap beans conducted in a greenhouse, a plastic tunnel and by unprotected cultivation using plots with six or more basic units, 12 or more plants per plot produced random fresh biomass data for fruits within the crop row.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23157/20037,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Morphophysiological plasticity of plagiotropic branches in response to change in the coffee plant spacing within rows,"Changes in spacing within rows may alter the morphology of the coffee plant by affecting the physiological constituents of its productivity. Even though some common plant responses to crop spacing variation are known, there is yet no scientific evidence that elucidates the effects of decreased spacing on the sourcesink relation in plagiotropic branches and, its association with both productivity and eco-physiological aspects of coffee leaves, mainly for new coffee cultivars in the Brazilian savannah. The aim of this work was to characterize the morphophysiological responses of Coffea arabica L. cultivars subjected to different spacing between plants within rows. Four Arabica coffee cultivars (Catuaí Vermelho IAC 144, Catuaí Amarelo IAC 62, Catuaí Amarelo IAC 32, and Tupi RN IAC 1669-13) were transplanted in January 2010. A row spacing of 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, and 0.80 m was adopted between plants, maintaining a 3.80-m constant between rows. A randomized block design with four replicates was applied. During the experimental period, several morphophysiological characteristics of plagiotropic fruiting branches were evaluated in the months of April and December in 2013 and, in April 2014. The evaluation was conducted based on two canopy positions; canopy toward the rows, representing low exposure to light or toward the inter-row spacing, representing high light exposure. Leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigments levels were minimally or not at all affected by changing either the coffee cultivars or plant spacing. During the first evaluation, the leaf-to-fruitratio linearly increased, regardless of the cultivar. Light-exposed branches showed higher content of carotenoids and chlorophyll a in leaves and lower leaf-to-fruit-ratio as compared to those within the plant canopy. A major reduction in the number of fruits per branch was observed which was closely related to a parallel decrease in the number of fruits per node but not in the number of fruiting nodes per branch. Although this response was largely cultivar-dependent, it also changed according to the branch position in the hedgerow. Our results suggest that all tested cultivars exhibit high morphophysiological plasticity and have the potential to grow under different plant spacing within rows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22230/20036,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Influence of electroacupuncture on the points BP6 and E36 regarding gastric motility in Wistar rats,"The study aimed to evaluate by radiographic examination the action of electroacupuncture on gastric motility in experimental animals. We used 24 Wistar rats, three months old, that received five metallic spheres, via orogastric tube (OT), with 2mL of barium contrast, followed by treatments: electroacupuncture points E36 and BP6 (T1); electroacupuncture in stitches (T2); sterile distilled water OT (T3); metoclopramide OT (T4). After treatment, serial radiographs, hourly, were made to follow the gastric emptying time of the spheres in rats. By analyzing the time of exit of the first sphere, animals in the group T1 had an average of 3h30min; at T2 the average was higher 6 hours; in T3 was 5h18min, and T4 showed an average of 4h36min. The action of electroacupuncture was comparable to the action of metoclopramide, which is know to increase peristalsis, whereas the response of the Shan group (T2) was close to the negative control group. Considering the results it was concluded that electroacupuncture at points predetermined significantly increases gastric peristalsis, reducing gastric emptying time in rats, may be an option for the treatment of motility disorders.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23030/20851,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,The importance of Gram positive bacteria as the cause of canine pyometra,"E. coli is the main bacteria isolated from infected uterus and bacterial endotoxin can lead to fatal endotoxic shock. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) precedes the endotoxic shock. Thus, early recognition of SIRS is important for patient treatment and prognostic. In Brazil, Gram positive bacteria are responsible for approximately 20% of all pyometra cases, and there is limited information about pathophysiology of shock and tissue injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of Gram positive bacteria to cause SIRS in bitches with pyometra. A prospective follow-up of 67 bitches with pyometra was performed, which were classified as SIRS + and SIRS- on admission. All bitches were surgically treated (ovariohysterectomy), uterine contents were collected in a sterile manner and the material was submitted to microbiological evaluation. Were identified in 55.2% of bitches E. coli (G1), 23.9% other Gram negative bacteria (G2) and 20.9% Gram positive bacteria (G3). The leukocyte profile, serum biochemistry and prevalence of SIRS were similar between the groups.

The accuracy with which the maps of spatial distribution of yield and the soil attributes are produced in the interpolation process influences their application and utilization. This paper aimed to compare three interpolation methods (inverse of the distance, inverse of the square distance, and ordinary kriging) in the construction of thematic maps of soybean yield and soil chemical attributes. A set of data referred to 55 sampling units for the construction maps of soybean yield and of eight soil chemical attributes, by different interpolation methods. The comparison was made based on the error matrix, by calculating the Kappa and Tau indices, beyond the relative deviation coefficient (RDC). It was noticed that the inverse of the square distance was the interpolator that less influenced the data behavior, and the best interpolation method dependent of the variability of the studied attribute. The kriging and the inverse of the square distance were considered the methods that presented the best results in the interpolation of data.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24585/20850,E-ISSN 1679-0359

However, extracts may have different effects on B. thuringiensis, compromising their mode of action. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of aqueous plant extracts on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) and their interactions on Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Erebinae). Cherry plant extracts (Eugenia uniflora), pepper (Capsicum baccatum), trumpet (Brugmansia suaveolens) and grape japan (Hovenia dulcis), were used at 5% concentrations. For compatibility studies, the extracts were mixed with Thuricide® (Btk) and the parameters evaluated were Colony Formation Units (CFU mL-1) for spores and, the A. gemmatalis mortality for crystals. The cherry extracts, pepper, and japan grape completely inhibited the CFU ml-1 of Btk and the cherry extract alone negatively affected the toxicity of Btk crystals, with significantly lower mortality of A. gemmatalis (20.40%) than that observed in the control with only Btk (79.44%).

The weight data of 40 Repartida goats reared in the Brazil Caatinga were included in this study. Weight data was collected every 30 days from birth until 270 days of age. The parameters of the models (A, mature body weight; B, constant of integration; k, maturation rate; m, inflection point) were estimated using the NLIN procedure of SAS. The logistic model showed a slightly higher average fit in comparison to the other models. The absolute growth rate suggests that the maximum growth rate was reached early. The effect of the contemporary groups was significant (P < 0.05), but only for the estimated k parameter. The estimated correlation between the A and k parameters was significant and negative, indicating a lower probability of a high body weight in adulthood. Goats of the Repartida ecotype are characterized by their high birth weight and low weight at maturity, which combined with the nutritional deficit, suggests that these animals have adapted to the adverse conditions of the Brazilian Caatinga region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26297/20837,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of supplementation plans for suckling beef calves managed on tropical pasture,"This study assessed the effects of different amounts of supplement on the productive performance, nutrional caracteristics and behaviour of suckling beef calves, as well as on the productive performance of their dams on tropical pastures. Forty-four male Nellore beef calves with an average age of 120 days and an initial average body weight (BW) of 145±3.7 kg and their respective dams, with an average BW of 449±6.9 kg, were used. The amounts of supplement evaluated were as follows: 0 = calves received only mineral mixture ad libitum; 3, 6, and 9 = calves received 3, 6, or 9 g kg-1 BW of supplement, respectively, containing 250 g CP kg-1 (as-fed). The experimental design was completely randomized. A positive linear effect (P < 0.01) was observed in the intakes of dry matter and organic matter, and a cubic effect (P < 0.07) was observed for the intake of neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein. There was quadratic effect (P < 0.06) for total digestibility of neutral detergent fiber. A cubic effect (P < 0.01) was observed for the calves’ performance. However, the calves’ supplementation did not affect the milk yield and performance (P ? 0.21) of their dams. The supplementation decreased grazing time (P < 0.01) but did not influence suckling time (P ? 0.59). It is recommended supplying of supplement containing 250 g CP kg-1 (as-fed) in amount 6 g kg-1 BW to suckling beef calves managed in tropical pasture. Supplementation of suckling beef calves increases the intake of dry matter, decreases grazing time and forage intake. However, it does not affect the suckling time and productive performance of their dams.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26175/20836,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Energy and tannin extract supplementation for dairy cows on annual winter pastures,"Energy supplementation can increase the consumption of metabolizable energy and substrate for microbial growth, while condensed tannins aid in increasing the duodenal flow of foodborne metabolizable proteins. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of energy supplementation and the inclusion of tannin extract (TE) from Acacia mearnsii (Weibull Black, Tanac S. A., Montenegro, Brazil) on the production performance of dairy cows grazing on winter pastures. Nine multiparous Holstein cows in mid lactation were distributed in a 3 × 3 Latin square experimental design over three periods of 28 days (21 adaptation and 7 sampling). The treatments were: without supplementation (WS), supplementation with 4 kg of corn grain (CG), and corn grain + 80 g of tannin extract (TE). The dry matter (DM) intake from pastures was similar among treatments, but the consumption of DM of the supplement was higher in the CG treatment than that in the TE treatment. The total DM intake was higher for the supplemented animals (17.3 kg?day-1) than that for the unsupplemented animals (14.9 kg?day-1) and in the TE treatment (17.7 kg?day-1) than in the CG treatment (16.7 kg day-1). Milk production increased from the unsupplemented to the supplemented animals (20.9 to 23.5 kg, respectively), while the content of urea N in the milk decreased (12.6 to 10.5 mg?100 mL-1, respectively). There were no differences in milk production or content of milk urea N between the CG and TE treatments. Energy supplementation is a tool for improving the nutritional profile and the performance of dairy cows in mid lactation grazing on annual winter pastures, while tannin extract aids in improving the energy balance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26067/20835,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Glycerin from biodiesel in the feeding of red-egg layers,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vegetable glycerin on performance and egg quality of red-egg layers in the second production cycle. A total of 252 Hy-Line Brown layers weighing 1.919 ± 0.095 kg, at 90 weeks, were used in a completely randomized design with six treatments and seven birds per replication. The experiment lasted 84 days. Treatments consisted of a control diet (no glycerin) and five diets with increasing levels of vegetable glycerin (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10%). The following variables were evaluated: feed intake (g/bird/day); egg production (%); egg weight (g); egg mass (g/bird/day); conversion per egg mass (kg kg) and per dozen eggs (kg/dz); percentages of albumen, yolk, and shell; eggshell thickness (mm); and egg specific gravity. (Y = 67.69 + 54.23X, R2 = 0.78) and egg mass (Y = 44.84 + 42.87X, R2 = 0.66) improved linearly with the glycerin levels. A quadratic effect was observed (Y = 114.11 + 336.96 X – 3,169.6 X2, R2 = 0.52) on feed intake. In conclusion, glycerin can be used to partially replace corn in diets for layers in the second production cycle at inclusion levels of up to 10%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26056/20880,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mechanical and chemical dehydration for pre-drying of black oat silage,"This study aimed to evaluate mechanical and chemical methods of forage dehydration in the production of black oat pre-dried silage (Avena strigosa Schreb) under different dehydration times. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block experimental design with five replications and arranged in a 2 x 6 factorial scheme. We assessed two methods of dehydration, mechanical and chemical, over six dewatering times, being made at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after cutting or application of glyphosate. Harvest took place at 88 days after emergence, at pre-flowering. We evaluated dry biomass production at harvest, dry matter losses during dehydration in the field, losses during ensiling, gauging effluent output, and pre-dried silage chemical composition. There was an interaction between dehydration method and harvest time for most of the production characteristics. Chemical dehydration showed an enhanced dry matter recovery at the field level, however, unsuitable for pre-dried silage. The longer the dehydration period, the lower the losses for both analyzed methods; nevertheless, the chemical method reached unsatisfactory DM contents to produce good quality silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26006/20832,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of production factors on feed intake and feed conversion ratio of grow-finishing pigs,"The aim of this study was to identify and quantify, through mathematical models, the production factors of grow-finishing (GF) phases that influence the daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in pigs. Sixty-five GF farms were evaluated between 2010 and 2013, linked to a cooperative system located in the western Parana State, Brazil, representing 463 batches, with a mean of 642.79 ± 363.29 animals per batch, equalling approximately 300,000 animals. Forty production factors were considered that related to management, sanitation, installations and equipment, nutrition, genetics and environment on the farms. The DFI was influenced by the barn's position relative to the sun (P = 0.048), initial body weight (P < 0.0001) and final body weight (P < 0.0001). It was observed that the FCR was influenced by the barn’s position relative to the sun (P = 0.0001), the use of humidifiers/misting (P = 0.03), the presence of composters (P = 0.006), trees on the sides of barns (P < 0.045), the initial body weight of the pigs (P < 0.0001) and duration of the grow-finishing phase (P < 0.0001). The variables selected in the models explained approximately 44 and 20% of the total variance in the DFI and FCR, respectively, demonstrating that this resource is a good tool for interpreting the factors related to the parameters evaluated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26026/20879,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Banana peel in the diet for F1 Holstein x Zebu cows,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of includingsun-dried banana peel in diets for F1 Holstein x Zebu cows on intake, digestibility and milk production. Diets were composed of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60% replacement of sorghum silage with banana peel provided to 10 cows in two simultaneous 5 x 5 Latin squares, with the experiment divided into five periods of 16 days. The dry matter intake showed a quadratic effect with maximum level at 38.30% substitution as well as intake of crude protein expressed in kg-1 day and percentage of body weight, with maximum at the levels of 50.09 and 45.69% inclusion of the peel, respectively. The intake of neutral detergent fiber and the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein showed a decreasing linear effect. Variation in weight and body condition score, milk production and feed conversion were not affected. The replacement of 60% sorghum silage with banana peel represents a viable alternative as it causes no change in cows with average production of 16.49 kg milk with 3.5% fat day-1, reducing feeding costs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26002/20831,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Brown rice, selenium yeast and ?-tocopherol acetate in chicken’s diet: effects on meat quality","The effects of diet supplementation with ?-tocopherol acetate (VE) and selenium yeast (SeL) on the water holding capacity (WHC), cooking weight loss (CL), drip loss (DL), pH, colour and selenium concentration of the breast of chickens fed diets based on corn or brown rice were studied. From 21 days of age, a total of 200 birds were housed in 38 floor pens (experimental unit) in a randomised 23 factorial arrangement. The levels of supplementation were VE (0 and 200 mg/kg), organic selenium (0 and 0.3 ppm) and two diets (100% corn and 100% brown rice) in a total of eight treatments: T1) corn + 0 SeL + 0 VE (control); T2) corn + 200 mg/kg VE + 0 SeL; T3) corn + 0 VE + 0.3 ppm SeL; T4) corn + 200 mg/kg VE + 0.3 ppm SeL; T5) brown rice + 0 VE +0 SeL; T6) brown rice + 200 mg/kg VE + 0 SeL; T7) brown rice + 0 VE + 0.3 ppm SeL; T8) brown rice + 200 mg/kg VE + 0.3 ppm SeL. The concentration of selenium in the breast increased with VE supplementation in the diet (P < 0.001). However, a positive interaction between VE and SeL on selenium concentration in the meat was found (P = 0.06). A better WHC with the inclusion of SeL and VE was found only in the rice-based diets. The replacement of corn by brown rice decreased (P < 0.05) the yellowness of the meat. CL and DL were not significantly affected by the treatments. Broilers fed with SeL supplemented diets showed a higher pH in the breast than diets without supplementation. In conclusion, the interaction between VE and SeL increased selenium in meat but improved WHC only in rice-based diets. The replacement of corn by brown rice decreased the yellowness of chicken breast meat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25959/20830,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Aerial parts of cassava as partial replacement for feed concentrates in the diet of lambs raised in semi-confinement,"This study aimed to evaluate the performance and economic viability of including the aerial parts of cassava (PAM) in the feed of semi-confined lambs for partial reduction of food concentrates. Fifty-six sheep, including males and females of the Pantaneira genetic group weighing 18.84 ± 2.02 kg on an average were used. The experiment was conducted in a factorial randomized complete block design with four treatments, each with seven females and seven males. Each group of 14 animals received one of four treatments: control, 10% of food concentrate in diet replaced with PAM, 20% replaced with PAM, and 30% replaced with PAM. The average total gain in weight (GWT) of the male lambs was 26.89% higher than the gains observed in females. Based on the cost analysis, we observed a linear effect (P < 0.01), i.e., a decrease in the feed cost for male and female groups with increase in PAM content. For the study period, the expenditure for the control male group was the highest at $ 17.60 per animal. Expenditure for the PAM 30 male group was the lowest at $ 12.74 per animal. These figures reflect the actual operating costs (COE), i.e., the power is 75.78% and 74.77%, for male and female groups respectively. The total cost, decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with PAM 30 treatment costing the least at $ 47.90, which was $ 7.02 lower than the control. When assessing the net margin per kilogram among the female groups, we observed a quadratic effect (P < 0.01) with a maximum gain of 23.98% when adding PAM and $ 0.50 kg-1. Our results show that the raising of lambs in semi-confinement was economically viable, and the addition of the aerial part of processed cassava in the feed presented a higher economic return. Further, the addition of aerial parts of cassava did not affect the performance of the lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25920/20878,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fermentation characteristics and nutritional quality of elephant grass silage added the buriti fruit peel,"The objective of this research was to evaluated the inclusion of buriti fruit peel as additive on the fermentation profile, losses, chemical composition and degradability of elephant grass silage. We used a completely randomized design with five levels of buriti fruit peel (0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 g kg-1). The silos were opened after 28 days of storage. In situ degradability monitoring was conducted using a split-plot design in which four animals represented the blocks and silage supplemented with five levels of buriti fruit peel represented the treatments. The use of the additive in elephant silage increased dry matter (DM) (P < 0.001), ether extract (EE) (P < 0.001), ash (P < 0.001), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (P < 0.001) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (P= 0.0000). The pH (P= 0.0000), N-NH3 (P = 0.024) and there was a decrease in gas losses (P < 0.001), effluent losses and dry matter recovery (P = 0.218) not were influenced by the addition of buriti fruit peel. The inclusion of buriti fruit peel linearly reduced the ruminal degradability DM of soluble fraction (a) (P < 0.001) and potentially degradable insoluble fraction (b) (P < 0.001). The DM content increase with the addition of the buriti fruit peel to the elephant grass silage promotes improvements in the fermentation process, reduces losses of nutrients and ruminal disappearance of dry matter and does not significantly change the chemical composition with the inclusion of 166.7 g kg-1 of the buriti fruit peel.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25817/20828,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance and serum chemistry profile of lambs fed on rations with increasing levels of urea,"Feed intake and efficiency, animal performance, and protein and energy metabolism were studied in lambs that were fed on increasing levels of urea (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of dry matter [DM]). A completely randomized design was used, with four treatments (urea levels) and six replicates. The lambs were fed ad libitum for 56 days until they reached an average body weight of 35 kg. The rations were composed of 34% Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.) and 66% concentrate. Crude protein (CP) constituted 17% of the diet on a dry matter basis, and total digestible nutrients (TDN) accounted for 65%, on average. The dry matter intake (DMI) and crude protein intake (CPI) were not influenced by the urea levels in the diet, presenting average values of 1.175 and 0.206 kg animal-1 day-1, respectively. The average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and gross feed efficiency (GFE) were also not influenced by urea levels (0.225 kg day-1, 5.33 kg DM kg gain-1 and 0.195 kg gain kg DM-1, respectively). Except for urea and glucose concentrations, blood parameters did not change with increasing urea in the diets. The mean values for total protein, albumin, globulin and creatinine in the serum were 7.11 g dL-1, 3.36 g dL-1, 3.75 g dL-1 and 0.91 mg dL-1, respectively. Serum urea decreased linearly and serum glucose increased linearly with urea levels in the diet. The addition of 1.5% of urea to the diets did not change feed intake and efficiency or animal performance, and did not cause metabolic disorders in feedlot lambs in the finishing phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25742/20827,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Somatic cell count and milk yield on physicochemical components of milk from free-stall housed cows,"Measurement and evaluation of the factors that may influence milk composition has been shown to determine the actual gains in milk quality and quantity. The study was conducted to evaluate the influence of daily milk yield on the physicochemical composition of milk and analyze the correlations between milk yield and somatic cell count (SCC) on the fat, protein, lactose, total solids and nitrogen urea contents in Holstein cows’ milk. A total of 3,544 data collected from 467 cows were evaluated. In the analysis, the animals were divided into groups – I (5-15 kg milk day-1), II (15-30 kg milk day-1) and III (above 30 kg milk day -1) – based on their daily production. Animals of Group I had higher SCC (P < 0.05) and fat and protein percentage when compared with Group III. However, the lactose content was lower (P < 0.05) than Group II and III. No correlation (P > 0.05) between SCC and fat, protein and total solids contents was observed. A lower milk yield is significantly associated with a higher SCC, which, besides hindering the quality of milk, compromises the cow's udder health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25599/20826,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Supplementation strategies for grazing beef cattle during the rainy-dry transition period,"An experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of supplementation strategies on intake, digestibility, and performance of Nellore cattle on pasture (Urochloa decumbens) during the rainy-dry transition period. The evaluated strategies were mineral supplementation (MS), self-feed supplementation (SF), and infrequent concentrate supplementation. Supplementation frequencies were three times per week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays - 3tw) and daily (7tw). Animals receiving concentrate supplementation had higher pasture DM and TDN intakes than those fed MS. There was no difference (P > 0.10) between concentrate supplementation strategies. Average pasture DM intake was 7.89, 8.09, and 8.10 kg day?1 for SF, 3tw, and 7tw, respectively. No effects were found (P > 0.10) between SF and infrequent supplementation, or for the supplementation frequencies tested. The lowest average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.10) was found for animals fed MS, and there was no difference between concentrate supplementation strategies for this variable. Average daily gains for MS, SC, 3tw, and 7tw were 661.4, 812.7, 811.5 and 819.2 g/animal, respectively. During the rainy-dry transition period, grazing beef cattle receiving concentrate supplementation have higher pasture and TDN intakes and better performance than animals fed mineral supplement only. Self-feed supplementation or supplementation provided three days per week do not compromise pasture and TDN intakes, nutrient digestibility, or performance of grazing beef cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25589/20825,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Supplementation levels for non-lactating cows grazing during the rainy season,"This study aimed to evaluate levels of concentrate supplementation (1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 kg day?1) for grazing dairy cows kept on Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzania pasture during the rainy season on nutrient intake and digestibility and rumen parameters. Four rumen cannulated non-lactating Holstein × Zebu crossbred cows were used in this study by a 4X4 Latin square design, which presented an average initial body weight of 521.69±31.98 kg. Each period lasted 17 days, being the first 10 days were used for animal adaptation and the remaining seven days for data collection. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of supplementation levels on total dry matter intake, although forage dry matter intake has been linearly decreased (P < 0.05). Treatments have no effect (P > 0.05) on the digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, or ether extract. There was a linear increase (P < 0.05) on daily rumination time and total rumination times according to supplementation levels. There was no significant effect of supplementation levels (P > 0.05) or time after supplementation on rumen pH. Rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration responded quadratically (P < 0.05) to times after supplementation, with a maximum estimated concentration of 17.61 mg dL?1 at 3.87 h after supplementation. Increasing supplementation levels for grazing dairy cows reduces forage intake but has no negative effects on total dry matter intake or rumen-fluid pH.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25529/20824,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Methane production by in vitro ruminal fermentation of feed ingredients,"This study investigates the methane and carbon dioxide gas production, dry matter degradation, and final pH values obtained during the in vitro incubation of corn grain, soybean hulls, citrus pulp, corn silage, and crude glycerin. Experiments were performed using a randomized block design with four incubation periods. Each period featured four replicates per ingredient and four blanks, totaling 16 repetitions per ingredient. The lowest total amount of produced gas (37.96 mL gincubated DM-1) and the lowest final pH value (4.95) were obtained for crude glycerin (P < 0.05), which, however, exhibited the highest (P < 0.05) DM degradation. Citrus pulp produced the largest amount (P < 0.05) of CH4 per gram of incubated DM (13.56 mL g-1). However, when methane production was expressed per gram of degraded feed, the ingredients with lower degradation values, such as soybean hulls and corn silage, produced more CH4 per gram of degraded DM. Citrus pulp and corn grain produced more (P < 0.05) CO2 per gram of incubated DM. However, per gram of degraded food, citrus pulp produced the largest amount of CO2 (P < 0.05). Crude glycerin and corn grain produced less methane (per gram of degraded feed) than citrus pulp, soybean hulls, and corn silage. Differentiation of ingredients based on their methane production ability is important to express methane production per unit degraded food mass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25367/20823,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance of dairy calves raised under two breeding systems,"Increasing concern about some animal production systems has placed considerable value on humanitarian breeding systems, aimed at ensuring animal welfare and comfort. Raising calves is one of the most important stages in a milk production system. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of Holstein dairy calves raised by two farming systems: conventional individual (CI) and collective with automatic calf feeder (CACF). Fourteen, 15-day-old Holstein dairy calves having an average initial body weight of 40 kg, were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with seven animals per treatment. The variables evaluated were the milk and feed intake, body weight, hip height, thoracic circumference and daily weight gain. The average milk intake was lower in the CACF (3.5 L animal-1 day-1) than CI (5.1 L animal-1 day-1) system. However, the feed intake was higher in the CACF (1.205 kg animal-1 day-1) compared to CI (0.910 kg animal-1 day-1) system. Body weight, thoracic circumference, hip height and daily weight gain were similar between the two systems. The CACF raised calves had a higher concentrate intake and lower milk intake than the calves raised under the CI system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25118/20877,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Productive performance, body chemical composition, and deposition of 42-day-old quail for meat subjected to quantitative dietary restriction","This study aimed to assess the effect of quantitative dietary restriction during refeeding on the performance, body chemical composition, and deposition, weight gain of organs and carcass parts of quails reared for meat (Coturnix coturnix coturnix). A total of 144 quails, between 11 to 42 days old, were distributed in a completely randomized design, 4x2 factorial scheme, at four levels of feed restriction (ad libitum, 30%, 50% and 70% restrictions on the daily intake ad libitum) for both genders. Therefore, there was eight treatments with three replicates and six birds each. At the tenth day of age, the animals were housed in cages, where remained for four days under adaptation. Dietary restriction was applied between the days 15 and 35 while refeeding was carried out from day 36 to 42. Compensatory weight gain (CWG), i.e. weight gain of organs and carcass parts, and feed efficiency (FE) were improved for quails under feed restriction. Fat (F), crude protein (CP), protein deposition rate (PDR) and fat in females (FDf) and carcass retained energy in females (CREf) increased linearly as restriction levels decreased. Maximum estimates of feed intake for males (MFIm), compensatory weight gain for males (CWGm) and females (CWGf), feed efficiency for males (FEm), protein deposition for males (PDm) and carcass retained energy in males (CREm) were obtained with restriction levels of 43.56%, 30.56%, 63.93%, 62.63%, 80.25%, 1.94% and 09.34% if compared to ad libitum, respectively. As a result, we concluded that according to quantitative feed restriction level, significant increases in feed efficiency and body weight gain, as well as decreases in carcass fat throughout quail refeeding period. As for gender, given the existing sexual dimorphism, females lost greater body weight than males under dietary restriction, besides showing higher protein and fat gains in the carcass and an enhanced feed efficiency during refeeding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25075/20876,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) in feed for broiler chicks using tannin as a sequestrant of toxic metals,"This study aimed to evaluate the use of wattle tannin as an adsorbent of toxic metals in broilers fed on diets with different levels of replacement of limestone with golden mussel meal. First, we conducted a trial to evaluate the performance of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 days old when fed on wattle tannin. For this we used 720 male broiler chicks that were one day old, in a completely randomized design with six treatments and six replications. The treatments were composed of basal diets with increasing levels of wattle tannin (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 g tonne-1), where the tannin replaced the inert material of the feed. All of the diets were isonutritive and isocaloric. The results showed that 250 g tonne-1 of tannin was detrimental to weight gain, final weight and feed conversion, and the use of 1000 g tonne-1 of wattle tannin, in addition to these effects, caused a drop in consumption of the ration. There was no effect of treatment on morphometric measurements of villi, crypt or the villus:crypt ratio. Next, we conducted a second test to evaluate the performance of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 days of age when fed with increasing levels of replacement (0, 25, 50, 75, 100%) of limestone with golden mussel and even supplementation or not wattle tannin. Five repetitions were used and the birds were housed in a completely randomized design. In diets with the inclusion of tannin, 250 g tonne-1 of wattle tannin was used, which replaced the inert material in the feed. In this test, 1200 male broiler chicks that were one day old were used. The results showed that the golden mussel contains large quantities of calcium, with low concentrations of toxic metals and microbiological contamination within the allowed range. Performance data show that mussel can be used to replace up to 100% of limestone in feed without affecting the variables, but the use of 250 g tonne-1 of wattle tannin affects the performance of chicks. Bone quality was not changed by the treatments. Phosphorus and calcium in the bones remained stable during treatment and only the gray variation showed interaction effects from the use of mussel and wattle tannin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24518/20875,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of nutritional plans for meat quail,"In this study, we evaluated three nutritional plans for quail from 1 to 42 days of age on performance, carcass quality, and economic viability. A total of 210 European quail were distributed into three treatments in a randomized complete design with five replicates and 14 birds in each plot. The following three treatments were tested: nutritional plan 1 - one diet, provided from 1 to 42 days of age; nutritional plan 2 - two diets, provided from 1 to 21 and 22 to 42 days of age; and nutritional plan 3 - three diets, provided from 1 to 14, 15 to 35, and 36 to 42 days of age. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared by the Student Newman Keuls (SNK) test at the 5% probability level. At 42 days of age, one bird from each sex, of each experimental unit, was slaughtered to evaluate the yields of carcass, breast, legs, and abdominal fat. Nutritional plans per rearing stage with two or three diets provided similar production performances and better feed conversion than the plan including only one diet. Studied carcass characteristics did not differ between treatments. The nutritional plan with three diets provided the best economic viability. The best nutritional plan for meat quail was that containing three types of diet, because it provided a lower cost with feed per kilogram of quail produced without compromising performance or carcass characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24472/20818,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance and egg quality parameters of laying hens submitted to different rearing densities,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different rearing densities during brooding (0 to 2 weeks) and growth (3 to 15 weeks) on performance and egg quality of laying hens (Hy-line W-36) during production phase (18 to 42 weeks). In the brooding phase, a total of 3250 day-old chicks were allocated in wire cages, distributed in a completely randomized design composed of 5 treatments (63.57; 66.38; 69.44; 72.80 and 76.50 cm²/bird) with 10 replications each. At the beginning of the growth phase, floor space in each treatment was increased. Therefore, a total of 750 birds were selected from the original treatments, which represented 237.57, 265.52, 300.92, 347.22, and 410.35 cm²/bird. At the end of the growing phase, 390 pullets were transferred to production facilities and distributed, according to their original treatment, in conventional cages with 430.76 cm²/bird (13 birds/cage). For this phase, only 6 replications per treatment were adopted. Experimental data were subjected to analysis of variance and, in the case of significant differences, means were analyzed using polynomial regression test. Body weight, weight gain and uniformity were compared during the brooding and growth phases. First-egg weight, age at first egg, age at 50% daily production, weights of egg, albumen, yolk and shell, egg mass, yolk diameter, yolk height, yolk index, albumen height, percentages of shell, albumen and yolk, shell thickness, Haugh unit, and egg specific gravity were analyzed during the production stage. In conclusion, raising pullets on 63.57 cm2/bird (71 birds/cage) does not affect chicks’ performance during the brooding phase. However, for the growth phase, the recommendation is to provide 410.35 cm2/bird, which corresponded to 11 birds/cage in this research. For the production period, the recommendation is to utilize pullets raised on 265.52 cm2/bird, which corresponded to 17 birds/cage on this research.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24770/20819,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Immune response of sheep naturally infected with Haemonchus spp. on pastures with two different nutritional conditions,"Parasitic nematodes in the gastrointestinal tract of small ruminants are considered one of the main causes of economical and productive losses. Haemonchus contortus is characterized as the major parasite affecting sheep worldwide. This study was designed to evaluate immunological responses in sheep naturally infected with Haemonchus spp. in two different feed grounds: native and cultivated pasture. Fecal and blood samples were collected weekly from fifteen Corriedale sheep, ages 8 to 12 months, to determine the counting of eggs per gram of feces (EPG), and the concentration of haematocrit, eosinophils, and cytokines during an 84-day experiment. Bromatological analysis of the two pasture treatments (types) showed levels of crude protein and non-fibrous carbohydrates of 9.7% and 12.3% in the native pasture and 14.3% and 23.7% for the cultivated pasture, respectively. No significant difference in haematocrit concentration was found during the experiment between different pastures (p < 0.05). However, significant differences were found in EPG, eosinophils, interleukins, and immunoglobulins levels after 21 days in the cultivated (nutritionally-enhanced) pasture. These data suggest that immune response was characterized in sheep by significantly higher peripheral eosinophilia and an increase in serum concentrations of IgE, IgA, IgG, TNF-?, IFN-?, and IL-6. Likewise, the improvement in forage condition resulted in a reduction of EPG and an increase of elements that improve a sheep’s immune system response against Haemonchus spp. infection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25869/20817,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Biochemical parameters of wild felids (Panthera leo and Panthera tigris altaica) kept in captivity,"Most populations of wild felines are now considered endangered or near extinction due to the indiscriminate hunting and the reduction of their natural habitat, caused by man. Due to the limited number of animals within a population, these species are especially vulnerable to the impacts of diseases and endogamy. In addition, wild felines are also susceptible to metabolic and behavioral changes related to a change in their natural conditions, habitat, and feeding, when the animal enters into captivity. There are few descriptions in the literature of the serum biochemistries of lions and tigers. This study presents the biochemical parameters of 23 captive lions (Panthera leo) and 10 captive Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) from the Zoological Park of the Sao Paulo Foundation. Serum urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, total, direct and indirect bilirubin were measured. In addition, serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, glucose, CK, lactate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined, as well as calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, sodium, and potassium. Biochemical parameters did not differ significantly among males and females lions, but higher albumin values were observed in male Panthera tigris altaica in comparison to females. The values obtained in this study may be used as reference for captive individuals of Panthera leo and Panthera tigris altaica.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24477/20815,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Antimicrobial multiple resistance index, minimum inhibitory concentrations, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris strains isolated from domestic animals with various clinical manifestations of infection","Proteus spp. are opportunistic multidrug resistant enterobacteria associated with diverse clinical diseases in domestic animals. However, Proteus infections in domestic animals are often misdiagnosed or considered contaminants in microbiological cultures rather than a primary agent of disease. Descriptions of Proteus infections in domestic animals are typically restricted to case reports, retrospective studies, or surveillance of other microorganisms. The present study investigated multiple antibiotic resistance indices, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and ESBL production in 73 strains of Proteus mirabilis (n = 69) and Proteus vulgaris (n = 4) isolated from domestic animals with various clinical manifestations. In dogs, the pathogen was most commonly associated with cystitis (48.21), enteritis (21.42%), otitis (14.29%), and conjunctivitis (3.57%). In bovines, the microorganism was predominant in cases of enteritis (22.22%), abscess (11.11%), otitis (11.11%), omphalitis (11.11%), and peritonitis (11.11%), and in organ fragments (11.11%). In equines (50.0%) and cats (100.0%), diarrhea was the main clinical sign. In vitro standard disk diffusion assay showed that the most effective antimicrobials against the isolates were imipenem (98.63), norfloxacin (95.89), amikacin (95.89), levofloxacin (90.41), ceftriaxone (87.64), and florfenicol (87.67). In contrast, the isolates commonly showed resistance to novobiocin (95.89), azithromycin (57.53), and trimethropim/sulfamethoxazole (39.73). Among the 73 isolates, the efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin according to MICs was 87.67%, 86.30%, 84.93%, and 82.19%, respectively. The MIC50 values of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were, respectively, 1.0, 0.004, 0.03, and 1.0 µg/mL. Thirty-three strains (45.21%) showed a antimicrobial multiple resistance index of ? 0.3. Multidrug resistance profiles of isolates were observed most frequently in dogs (n = 25; 75.76%), particularly in those with cystitis (n = 13; 52.0%), followed by bovines (n = 4; 12.12%), equines (n = 2; 6.06%), and cats (n = 2; 6.06%). Two (2.7%) strains, obtained from canine skin and feces, were diagnosed phenotypically as ESBL-producers. Here, we observed the diversity of Proteus infections in domestic animals. The presence of multidrug-resistant isolates and ESBL-producers reinforces the need for appropriate antimicrobial use and in vitro antimicrobial tests to support therapy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23923/20874,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Parasitological analysis of green leaf lettuce cultivated in different production systems,"This study analysed parasite contamination in green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa), grown in different cultivation systems (conventional, organic, and hydroponic), from a family farmer cooperative in the municipality of Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil. Samples were collected at weekly intervals during five months, totalling 180 vegetable samples (60 samples of leaf lettuce from each cultivation system). Lettuce leaves were washed with 0.5% Extran MA 02, and the resulting fluid subjected to sedimentation and centrifugal flotation for recovery of parasite structures. Overall, 71 samples (39.4%) were contaminated with at least one parasite structure, 34 (47.9%) from lettuce grown in the hydroponic system, 20 (28.2%) from the organic system, and 17 (23.9%) from the conventional system. Entamoeba spp. cysts were the most common parasite structures found in the leafy vegetables, with the highest cyst counts found in the hydroponic system (p = 0.003). It is concluded that, regardless of the cultivation system (conventional, organic, or hydroponic), there is a possibility of green leaf lettuce contamination by intestinal parasites. Measures that improve sanitary conditions during production, as well as proper hygiene during the preparation of raw leafy vegetables, may be important to reduce contamination and consequent transmission of parasite diseases from raw leafy vegetable consumption.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25607/20816,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Needle muscle biopsy: technique validation and histological and histochemical methods for evaluating canine skeletal muscles,"This study evaluated the needle muscle biopsy technique using a 6G Bergström percutaneous needle combined with histological and histochemical methods to analyze the skeletal muscle of dogs. There are few studies about canine skeletal muscles and a lack of reports in the literature about tissue collection and analysis for canine species. Evaluation of 32 German Shepherd samples collected from the gluteus medius, at a depth of 3 cm, was performed. The choice of gluteus medius and the 3-cm depth provided good quantity fragments with sufficient sizes (3–5 mm), which permitted optimal visualization of muscle fibers. Myosin ATPase, at pH 9.4, 4.6, and 4.3, and SDH reactions revealed that all muscle samples analyzed had fibers in the classic mosaic arrangement, enabling counting and typification. The mean percentages of fibers were 29.95% for type I and 70.05% for type II. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the percutaneous needle biopsy technique for canine skeletal muscles is a safe and easy procedure that obtains fragments of proper sizes, thereby enabling the study of muscle fibers. Standardization of the muscle of choice and the depth of muscle sample collection significantly contributed to this success. This is an important method to evaluate muscle fiber types of dogs and diagnose important diseases affecting the skeletal muscles.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22271/20813,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Anti-equine arteritis virus activity of ethanolic extract and compounds from Origanum vulgare,"The equine arteritis virus (EAV) is responsible by an important respiratory and reproductive disease in equine populations and there is no specific antiviral treatment available. The objective of this study was to investigate the activity of an ethanolic crude extract of Origanum vulgare (EEO) and of isolated compound caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, luteolin, carnosol, carnosic acid, kaempferol and apigenin against EAV. The assays were performed using non-cytotoxic concentrations. The antiviral activity was monitored initially by cytopathic effect inhibition (CPE) assay in RK13 cells in the presence or absence of EEO. Pre-incubated cells with EEO were also examined to show prophylactic effect. Direct viral inactivation by EEO and isolated compounds was evaluated by incubation at 37°C or 20°C. After the incubation period, the infectivity was immediately determined by virus titrations on cell cultures and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/100 µL. There was significant virucidal activity of EEO and of the compounds caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, carnosic acid and kaempferol. When EEO was added after infection, EEO inhibited the virus growth in infected cells, as evidenced by significant reduction of the viral titre. The results provide evidence that the EEO exhibit an inhibitory effect anti-EAV. Among the main compounds evaluated, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, carnosic acid, kaempferol and mainly quercetin, contributed to the activity of EEO. EEO may represent a good prototype for the development of a new antiviral agent, presenting promising for combating arteriviruses infections.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21181/20812,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Lactose reduced ice cream enriched with whey powder,"Ice cream is a food product that pleases the palate of consumers worldwide. Whey powder (WP) has various technological and functional properties. However, WP increases the lactose content of the final products in which it is incorporated and causes grittiness and intolerance in lactose-sensitive individuals. This study aimed to produce ice cream with milk powder (MP) replaced by WP (MP/WP), decrease the lactose content by enzymatic hydrolysis and verify the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the final product. Initially, the variables ?-galactosidase concentration and reaction time were studied for the response of the percentage of lactose hydrolysis in a milk ice cream base, using a full 22 factorial design(FFD).With the reaction conditions defined (0.5 g L-1 of ?-galactosidase at 37 C for 4 h)the sucrose concentration and MP/WP replacement variables were then studied in the ice cream formulation for the percentage of lactose hydrolysis and overrun responses using a 22 FFD. The lactose hydrolysis, which ranged between 86.59-97.97%, was not affected by the MP/WP replacement in the ice cream, whilst the overrun was increased by the MP/WP replacement. The physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the ice cream were either not influenced or positively influenced by lactose hydrolysis and MP/WP replacement.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25474/20811,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Quality and safety of artisan cheese produced in the serrana region of Santa Catarina,"The serrano artisan cheese produced from raw milk of dairy cattle is a typical product of high-altitude farms in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. However, marketing of the cheeses occurs illegally because they lack the minimum maturation period required for cheese produced from raw milk. The production of artisan cheeses is required to follow strict hygiene standards. This study aimed to test the quality and safety of cheeses that were produced in 31 farms of the Serrana region in Santa Catarina after 14 and 28 days of maturation. Coliform count was measured at 35 °C, and presence of other microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Listeria spp., and Salmonella spp. were also tested. Fat and protein percentages, acidity, salt content, and humidity were also evaluated. Data were subjected to statistical analyses using the SAS® software. After 14 and 28 days of maturation, 74.19% (23/31) and 64.52% (20/31) of samples, respectively, showed higher numbers of coliforms at 35 °C than those permissible by law. Higher than permissible numbers of E. coli were observed in 45.16% (14/31) and 48.39% (15/31) of the samples analyzed after 14 and 28 days of maturation, respectively. Coagulase-positive staphylococci values above 103 CFU/g were observed in 54.84% (17/31) and 51.61% (16/31) of cheese samples after 14 and 28 days of maturation, respectively. Contamination with Salmonella spp. was not detected. However, Listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b was isolated in 3.23% (1/31) and 6.45% (2/31) of samples after 14 and 28 days of maturation, respectively. The results of humidity tests classified the cheese samples into three categories: low, medium, and high humidity. Semi fat cheeses were predominant in both maturation periods, although the samples were classified in thin, semi fat, and fat cheeses. The main variations in the compositions of analyzed samples occurred for salt and acidity levels. The maturation process has not proven to be effective in reducing microbiological contamination to compliance levels. Considering the heterogeneity of the analyzed cheese samples, the frequency of non-conformities with respect to microorganisms and pathogens present in the samples, this study indicates the necessity to improve the Serrano artisan cheese production system through adoption of good manufacturing practice measures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25231/20810,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Biological and microbiological attributes in Oxisol managed with cover crops,"The inclusion of winter cover crops and fertilization with nitrogen to the soil can have an effect on their biological and microbiological attributes. The aim of this study was to evaluate biological and microbiological attributes in soil under different winter cover crops and nitrogen doses. The experiment was conducted at the Frederico Westphalen-RS campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) in a Rhodic Hapludox soil. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial arrangement (2 x 10): 10 winter cover crops systems (Fallow [control], black oats, white oats, ryegrass, forage turnip, vetch, white lupine; black oat + forage turnip; black oat + vetch and black oat + vetch + fodder turnip), and two nitrogen rates in the form of urea applied in successive crops of beans common and maize, with four replications. We assessed the biological attributes (Margalef’s richness, Simpson’s dominance, Shannon’s diversity and abundance of organisms) and microbiological (carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient of the soil). The fallow with wild species and white lupine showed greater Simpson’s dominance and abundance of organisms due to the increase in the number of individuals of the order Collembola. Vetch improved the biological attributes of the soil with increase in Collembola abundance and diversity of organisms of soil fauna. The application of nitrogen favored the microbial biomass carbon and reduced the metabolic quotient.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24882/20870,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Gas exchange of citrus rootstocks in response to intensity and duration of saline stress,"Soil and water salinity cause physiological disorders in sensitive plants, such as altered gas exchange in citrus genotypes. However, it is possible to analyse these effects and to identify genotypes tolerant to salt stress. An experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the tolerance of citrus genotypes considering the irrigation with saline water during rootstock formation. The study took place under greenhouse conditions in Pombal county, Paraiba, Brazil. A randomised block design was used, with treatments arranged in a factorial scheme (5 x 8). The two factors were: [i] five salinity levels of irrigation water (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2 and 4.0 dS m-1) and [ii] eight genotypes of citrus rootstocks: 1. ‘Rangpur Santa Cruz’ lime (LCRSTC); 2. common ‘Sunki’ mandarin (TSKC) x ‘Swingle’ citrumelo (CTSW) - 028; 3. TSKC x CTSW - 033; 4. TSKC x CTSW - 041; 5. ‘Volkamer’ lemon (LVK) x ‘Rangpur’ lime (LCR) - 038; 6. ‘Sunki of Florida’ mandarin (TSKFL); 7. TSKC and 8. ‘Florida’ rough lemon (LRF). Gas exchange was evaluated at 15, 30 and 60 days after the beginning of the saline water application. High water salinity reduces gas exchange in citrus genotypes, which was more evident at 15 days from the beginning of stress. The genotypes ‘Santa Cruz Rangpur’ lime, TSKC x CTSW - 041, LVK x LCR - 038 and ‘Florida’ rough lemon exhibit a satisfactory physiological behaviour during the first 30 days of exposure to the stress, showing moderate tolerance to salt stress. The genotypes TSKC x CTSW - 033 and common ‘Sunki’ mandarin are the most sensitive to salinity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25237/20873,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Graft incompatibility in Prunus spp. preceded by SPAD index reduction,"This study aimed to measure the leaf chlorophyll index (SPAD 502 Plus) in three peach cultivars grafted on different clonal rootstocks, totaling 68 scion/rootstock combinations, between five and nine months after planting in the field to determine possible graft incompatibility symptoms in Prunus spp. Three field trials with peach scion cultivars ‘BRS-Kampai’, ‘Jade’, and ‘Maciel’ grafted on 18, 25, and 25 clonal rootstocks, respectively, were established in July and August 2014. Own-rooted scion trees (without rootstock) were used as controls in each trial and all rootstocks were propagated from herbaceous cuttings. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and each plot consisting of a single plant. Three SPAD measurements were taken between January and April 2015. SPAD index values for rootstocks ‘Mirabolano 29C’ (P. cerasifera) and ‘Marianna 2624’ (P. cerasifera x P. munsoniana) were significantly lower in the three scion cultivars, culminating with tree death from graft incompatibility. Rootstocks ‘Mirabolano 29C’ and ‘Marianna 2624’ showed translocated graft incompatibility with scion cultivars BRS-Kampai, Jade, and Maciel and tree death was preceded by a reduction in SPAD index values five months after field planting. No reduction in SPAD index values was observed in the other scion/rootstock combinations nine months after planting, but these combinations should be monitored for a longer period to confirm their graft compatibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24589/20803,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Root growth of soybean cultivars under different water availability conditions,"Vigorous growth of soybean root system is a desired trait in breeding programs. However, few studies have evaluated this feature under field conditions. The aim of this research was to evaluate root growth of eight soybean cultivars under different water availability conditions. The experiment was carried out in Londrina, Paraná state, Brazil, during two growing seasons - with and without water deficit during the vegetative period. Soybean roots were sampled at flowering and assessed for dry matter yield, area and length at 0-0.25; 0.25-0.50; 0.50-0.75 and 0.75-1.00 m depth ranges. On average, root length and area of the cultivars Embrapa 48 and BRS 284 under water deficit were 66% and 40% larger than the others at 0.25-0.50 and 0.50-0.75 m layers, respectively. Under suitable water supply, BRS 282 showed the highest root length and area. Apart from the cultivars Embrapa 48, BRS 284, and BRS 255RR, soybean root growth was mostly lower under water deficit throughout the vegetative stage, which might been due to a higher soil resistance to root penetration, resulting from low soil water content. Drought increased the proportion of soybean roots at subsoil layers, mainly for Embrapa 48 and BRS 284. The cultivars Embrapa 48 and BRS 284 are promising to be used in breeding programs targeting superior root growth in subsoil layers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25212/20809,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Recent changes in agrarian systems of the Microregion of Toledo and Northern Pioneer Territory in Paraná State, Brazil","During the period of 1950 through 2000, a green-revolution-based model mostly for commodities boosted global agricultural production. From the 70’s, this design became consolidated in Brazil and other countries because of policies and strategies by states and private groups. However, some doubts has been raised on its environmental and socioeconomic issues, in special for family farming. This study aimed to contribute by identifying changes and resistance in agricultural structures, systems and demographic aspects of this model and its adoption by farmers. It was carried out in the state of Paraná - Brazil, within the microregion of Toledo and in the northern pioneer area, which represent the history and diversity of this state about socioeconomic and human aspects, as well as technical development. It was based on statistics of agricultural censuses (1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1996 and 2006), population censuses (1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010) and municipal agricultural production data (1980-2012). Data from both areas were compared to each other and analyzed in face of state changes. There has been a decrease in farming properties and rural population, with an outstanding decline in the number of young people and women. Moreover, results showed a large reduction of properties with 20 to 50 ha, and an increase in those of up to 2 ha. Such decline is due to technological standard changes throughout the period, as well as recent grants offered to rural areas, as housing and leisure spaces. Both regions showed expansion of soybean plantations, but integrating distinctively to agriculture and, finally, family farming continuity, despite the intense changes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25147/20808,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Instability of the expression of morphological and phenological descriptors to environmental variation in white oat,"Morphological and phenological characters are used in the selection, breeding, and description of plant varieties with varying genotypes. The stability of these descriptors in the face of environmental changes can determine their usefulness in situations where plant varieties must be reliably identified. The objective of this study was to verify the expression of morphological and phenological descriptors and use them to distinguish between white oat cultivars (Avena sativa L.) in two growing periods. For this, five cultivars, protected and belonging to four breeders, referred to as G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5, were sown in the typical growing season in southern Brazil (autumn-winter) and outside that period (winter-spring), and grown for forty days. The experiment was established in the field, in a randomized block design replicated three times. The cultivars were evaluated for 42 descriptors (15 quantitative and 27 qualitative). Quantitative data were analyzed by analysis of variance, the comparison of averages, and multivariate analysis by generating average euclidean distances. Qualitative data were analyzed by mode determination, followed by obtaining the similarity index. The relationship between cultivars was illustrated by dendrograms. The stability index for each descriptor was calculated. A genotype x environment interaction was observed for 28 descriptors. The stability of descriptor appearance and persistence over the growing season was higher in qualitative (44%) than in quantitative (7%) descriptors. The most stable qualitative descriptors were lemma color, hairiness of the upper node, flag leaf position, hairiness of the base of the grain, basal grain length, and rachilla length. The most stable quantitative descriptor was flag leaf length. Shifting the white oat growing season from autumn-winter to winter-spring reduced the cycle and modified the expression of most descriptors by changing the phenotypic distinctness between cultivars.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25123/20872,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Agronomic characterization and responses to coffeeleaf rust in coffee progenies resistant to the gall nematode Meloidogyne exigua,"The aim of this study was to determine agronomic characteristics and responses to the coffee leaf rust fungus (Hemileia vastatrix Berk. et Br.) in coffee progenies resistant to the gall nematode Meloidogyne exigua. The experiment was conducted in December 2000 at Ouro Verde Farm (FazendaOuro Verde), located in the municipality of Campos Altos – Minas Gerais (MG). Ten F3:4 progenies were evaluated. They were derived from crosses between CIFC 2570 Timor Hybrid selections and Catuaí cultivars known to be resistant to M. exigua. The Catuaí Vermelho IAC 99 cultivar served as a control. A randomized block design with three replicates was used. In total, there were thirty-three plots consisting of eight plants each. The following characteristics were assessed between the harvests of 2011/2012 and 2014/2015: (a) yield expressed as processed coffee bags ha-1; (b) rust incidence and severity; (c) vegetative vigor; (d) percentage of coffee fruits at the “cherry” stage; (e) percentage of floaters; (f) crown diameter; (g) percentage of coffee beans of size sieve 17 and higher; and (h) sensory analysis of the coffee beverage. The results indicated the following: (a) the H514-7-14-2, H514-7-4-5, H493-1-2-2, H514-7-16-3, H514-7-8-11, H518-2-10-1, and H514-5-2-4 progenies were the most productive; (b) all progenies showed promising resistance to coffee leaf rust; (c) all genotypes had the potential for specialty coffee production; (d) the H493-1-2-2 progeny showed resistance both to rust and the nematode, and has good potential for specialty coffee production; and (e) the yields of the H514-7-8-11, H518-2-10-1, H514-5-2-4, H514-7-16-3, H514-7-14-2, H514-7-4-5, and H493-1-2-2 progenies were significantly higher than that of the Catuaí IAC 99 control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25052/20871,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Chemical soil attributes after wheat cropping under nitrogen fertilization and inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense,"Azospirillum brasilense plays an important role in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in grasses. However, further studies are needed to define how much mineral N can be applied while simultaneously maintaining BNF contribution and maximizing crop yield and to determine the impact of these practices on soil fertility. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of inoculation with A. brasilense, in conjunction with varying N doses and sources in a Cerrado soil, on soil chemical attributes after two years of irrigated wheat production. The experiment was initiated in Selvíria - MS under no-tillage production in an Oxisol in 2014 and 2015. The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications, and treatments were arranged in a 2 x 5 x 2 factorial arrangement as follows: two N sources (urea and Super N - urea with inhibitor of the enzyme urease NBPT (N - (n-butyl thiophosphoric triamide))), five N rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha-1), and with or without seed inoculation with A. brasilense. The increase in N rates did not influence the chemical soil attributes. Super N acidified the soil more compared to urea. A. brasilense inoculation reduced the effect of soil acidification in intensive irrigated wheat cultivation; however, the base extraction was higher, resulting in a lower soil CEC after cultivation with inoculation. Therefore, the cultivation of wheat inoculated with A. brasilense was not harmful to soil fertility because it did not reduce the base saturation and organic matter content (P, K, Ca, Mg, and S).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25051/20805,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physiology of ‘Paluma’ guava under irrigation with saline water and nitrogen fertilization,"The use of saline water in irrigation causes osmotic and toxic effects and nutritional imbalance in plants, leading to morphophysiological modifications in the leaves and compromising the production of photosynthetic pigments, which negatively reflects in the growth and development of the crops. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of irrigation water salinity on the content of photosynthetic pigments and leaf morphophysiology of guava seedlings cv. ‘Paluma’ under nitrogen (N) fertilization. A randomized block design was used, testing five levels of irrigation water electrical conductivity - ECw (0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7, and 3.5 dS m-1) and four N doses (541.1, 773.0, 1,004.9, and 1,236.8 mg of N dm-3 of soil) in a 5 x 4 factorial scheme with three replicates and five plants per plot. The contents of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves of the guava seedlings cv. ‘Paluma’ were inhibited by the increase in irrigation water salinity at 190 days after emergence, and the salt stress was lessened with the N dose of 1,004.9 mg dm-3 up to an ECw level of 1.2 dS m-1. Leaf morphophysiology of guava seedlings was not compromised by irrigation water salinity up to 1.5 dS m-1, and the highest values were obtained in plants fertilized with 541.1 mg of N dm-3.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24545/20869,E-ISSN 1679-0359

However, the impact of seeding rate on the physical and physiological qualities of soybean seeds needs to be better elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of soybean plant density on the seed size as well as the effects of the interaction between the plant density and seed size on the seed mass, green seed occurence, and physiological seed quality. The experiments were carried out in the growing seasons of the years 2013/14 and 2014/15 in a Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico, under a randomized complete block design, using the NK 7059 RR cultivar with six replications. Four plant densities (150, 300, 440, and 560 thousand viable seeds ha–1) were evaluated. After the classification of seeds into four sizes, using a set of sieves, a 4 ×4 factorial scheme was used for the statistical analysis of the four plant densities and four seed sizes. The seed samples were evaluated for the seed mass, green seed percentage, germination, and vigor. Under thermal and water stress during seed development, an increase in the seeding rate led to a reduction in the green seed occurrence and an increase in the seed size and mass. However, in the absence of thermal and water stress, the seed size and mass were not altered by the seeding rate and, there was no occurrence of green seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24494/20800,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Phosphorus bioavailability in soybean grown after pasture under different fertility regimes,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the residual effect of phosphorus (P) fertilizer applied to an Urochloa decumbens cv. Basilisk pasture on the P bioavailability to the following soybean crop. Low-productivity pasture, planted on an Oxisol in an experimental field at Embrapa Cerrados, was divided into three strips, each of 1.5 ha and fertilized by broadcasting annual applications of 0, 20 and 40 kg ha-1 of P2O5 for four years. After the pasture was desiccate with herbicide, soybeans were sown and fertilized with 0, 50 and 100 kg ha-1 of P2O5 applied within each strip, making a total of nine (3x3) P treatments. Residual available P content (Mehlich-1 and resin) from the pasture fertilization was lower than from soybean fertilization. However, the bioavailable residual P from the pasture, determined by P accumulated in plants, production of dry matter and grain yield, had similar availability to inorganic P applied to the soybean. Early P fertilization applied to pasture is technically feasible and can be used to maintain the pasture: it is recommended to replace corrective fertilization for following soybean crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23868/20868,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Granulometric and oxidizable carbon fractions of soil organic matter in crop-livestock integration systems,"The identification of the labile and recalcitrant forms of soil organic matter (SOM) allows to rapidly define, or even predict if the management used favors increments or losses of carbon in the soil. Thus, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of different grazing intensities and soybean crops on the oxidizable and granulometric fractions of the SOM in a crop-livestock integration combined with no-tillage system (CLI-NTS), established in 2009 in the Goiás Federal University. The treatments consisted of three different pasture heights (0.25 m P25; 0.35 m P35; 0.45 m P45), and areas without grazing (AWG), and a native vegetation area of the Cerrado biome (NCA), adjacent to the experimental area, was evaluated as references and compared with the cultivated areas. Soil samples (Oxisol - USDA; typic distroferric Red Latosol - SiBCS) were collected in the layers 0.00-0.05; 0.05-0.10 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m of each area, and arranged in a completely randomized experimental design with six replications. The soil total carbon was quantified (TC) by dry combustion. The SOM granulometry and oxidizable SOM were fractionated into particulate carbon (OCp), carbon bond with minerals (OCm) and four oxidizable fractions with increasing degrees of recalcitrance (F1 < F2 < F3 < F4). These soil attributes were evaluated at two different times, representing the post-pasture cycle (PP) and post-soybean crop (PC) periods. The lower contents of total soil carbon (TC) were found in the F1 and F3 fractions of the area without grazing, suggesting that the crop-livestock integration increases the organic matter content in the soil surface layer regardless of the pasture height. The areas without grazing and with different pasture heights in CLI had similar contents of OCp and OCm due to the experiment short time of implementation (3 years). The fractionation of the oxidizable SOM was more sensitive in differentiating the treatments, showing that the higher intensity of grazing used (P25) provided a better balance of carbon accumulation between the SOM labile and recalcitrant fractions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24512/20801,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Residual compost from the production of Bactris gasipaes Kunth and Pleurotus ostreatus as soil conditioners for Lactuca sativa ‘Veronica’,"This study evaluated the residual compost from the production of Bactris gasipaes Kunth (pupunha heart of palm) (RP) and the mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus (RM). The residuals were used as soil conditioners for Lactuca sativa ‘Veronica’ crops. After adding RP and RM to the soil, all treatments exhibited similar behaviors and soils in each treatment were classified as eutrophic. Soil treatments involving increased application of residual compost resulted in the production of lettuce with greater widths because of an increase in the angle between the stem and leaf, resulting from a lack of nitrogen available to the plant. Soil treatments with 5% of RP and RM resulted in a 1.7 and 1.2 times (44% and 22%, respectively) decrease in dry weight of lettuce, as compared to the soil without residual compost addition. The addition of RP and RM as soil substrate reduced the growth of lettuce compared to the soil without residual compost. In general, the possibility of replacing chemical fertilizers (NPK) with RP or RM without previous composting was found to be inefficient. The resultant dry weight parameters were below the commercial level, and a complete period of composting RP and RM was deemed necessary for incorporating nitrogen into the soil. Lignocellulosic mushrooms such as Pleurotus spp. present highly fibrous residual compost with low nitrogen content, thus requiring a full period of composting before subsequent use in soil enrichment for various crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23974/20799,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Improvement of growth and productivity of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) through foliar applications of naphthalene acetic acid,"Plant growth regulators like naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) positively affect the growth and yield of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to check the foliar application of NAA on growth and yield components of cotton variety Bt.121 under field condition at research area of agriculture farm near Cholistan Institute of Desert Studies (CIDS), The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The experiment was comprised of foliar application of NAA (1%) viz. T0 (control), T1 (One spray of NAA), T2 (Two sprays of NAA), T3 (Three sprays of NAA), T4 (Four sprays of NAA). The first foliar spray was applied at 45 days after sowing (DAS) and later on it was continued with 15 days interval with skilled labour by hand pump sprayer. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design and each treatment was replicated three times. Data recorded on growth, chlorophyll contents, yield and yield components showed a significant increase with the application of NAA. Furthermore, earliness index, mean maturity date and production rate index were also influenced with foliar application of NAA. On the basis of growth and yield parameters it can be concluded that four spray of NAA (1%) can be applied commercially under field conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23409/20797,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Relationship between soil organic matter and nematodes in sugarcane fields,"Sugarcane plays an important socio-economic role in northeastern Brazil. However, the low yield in this region is associated with several factors (e.g. frequent occurrence of plant-parasitic nematodes). In order to observe the influence of soil organic matter on the nematodes, this study aimed to characterize the spatial nematode distribution in a sugarcane field. The study was carried out in Goiana - Pernambuco State (Brazil), fifty days after sugarcane cutting (10 days after vinasse application). The sampling scheme consisted of a regular 60 × 50-m grid, 10 m spaced, through 0 to 0.2 m depth. Spatial distribution was evaluated by semivariograms fit and performed by ordinary kriging interpolation for mapping. Exponential and spherical models promoted the best fit to semivariograms, resulting in ranges from 16 to 19 m. There was a strong negative correlation between soil organic matter and plant-parasitic nematode population density. Free-living nematodes had a similar distribution pattern as soil organic matter content. These results indicated that soil organic matter had important effects on spatial distribution of both plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23393/20796,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Strobilurin and boscalid in the quality of net melon fruits,"Until recently, fungicides were used exclusively for disease control; however observations of physiological effects brought a new concept to the use of these products. Strobilurins have positive physiological effects on crop yield, due to the increase of liquid photosynthesis and better hormonal balance. However, boscalid complements the action of these fungicides, applied alternately or together. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of strobilurins (azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin), boscalid and the mixture of these on the physical-chemical quality of net melon fruits (Cucumis melo var. Reticulatus). The experiment was conducted in the municipality of São Manuel (SP), using the hybrid of Cantaloupe M2-308 net melon, the experimental design was in randomized blocks with five replicates. The treatments used were: T1 - control; T2 - azoxystrobin 60g ha-1 of active principle (a.p.); T3 - boscalid 75g ha-1 of the a.p.; T4 - pyraclostrobin 50g ha-1 of the a.p.; T5 - boscalid (37,5g ha-1) of the a.p. + pyraclostrobin (25g ha-1) of the a.p. The first application of the treatments was carried out at fourteen days after the transplanting of the seedlings and the others at seven day intervals, totaling eight applications throughout the cycle. Two fruits of each plot were collected, which were identified for analysis in the laboratory. The following characteristics were evaluated: fresh fruit mass; mesocarp thickness, pulp texture, peel trajectory, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids and the ratio. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and the averages compared by the Tukey test at 5% probability using the SISVAR program. The fruits of the plants treated with boscalid 75g ha-1 were the ones that showed higher concentration of soluble solids and low titratable acidity, resulting in a better ratio. Despite the lower value, the fruits of the plants treated with pyraclostrobin 50g ha-1 showed a high ratio value, besides presenting higher value for pulp texture. The mixture of boscalid (37.5g ha-1) + pyraclostrobin (25g ha-1) also showed high values of soluble solids which resulted in a good “ratio” value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21485/20795,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of grazing beef cows receiving supplements with different protein contents,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with different crude protein contents on the productive performance of grazing beef cows during post-calving. Thirty-six beef cows, with age and average body weight of 5 years and 490±17.9 kg, respectively, were used. The experimental design was completely randomized. The treatments were: control = cows received only mineral mixture ad libitum; supplemented = cows received 1 kg d-1 of supplement containing 80, 200, or 320 g crude protein (CP) kg-1. There was no effect (P ? 0.16) of supplementation on voluntary intake. A linear effect (P < 0.02) of the CP content in the supplements was observed among supplemented cows, only for the CP intake. Supplementation did not affect (P ? 0.20) the total digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein, and CP. Among supplemented cows, a positive linear effect (P < 0.01) of the CP content in the supplement was observed for the CP digestibility. Intestinal flow of microbial nitrogen compounds and efficiency of synthesis microbial were not affected (P ? 0.18) by treatments. Performance, milk yield and composition were not also affected (P ? 0.11) by treatments. Supplementation did not affect (P ? 0.52) non-esterified fatty acids, urea nitrogen and progesterone serum concentrations. It is concluded that supplementation of grazing beef cows during post-calving does not affect nutritional and productive performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24728/19790,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Physical composition of carcass, commercial cuts and meat characteristics of crossbred Holstein-Zebu young bulls fed crude glycerin levels in the diets","Assessment of carcass and meat characteristics of Holstein-Zebu crossbred young bulls finished in feedlot with crude glycerin levels (0, 60, 120, and 240 g kg-1 dry matter) in replace of ground pearl millet grain and babassu mesocarp bran mixture-based diets. Twenty four bulls 30-month-old and initial average body weight of 390 ± 31.5 kg were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments and six replicates. The absolute weight (kg) of commercial cuts did not fit any of the tested regression models. However, the weight of the short ribs and the pistol cut were higher for animals fed with crude glycerin in relation to those fed without inclusion of this food in the diet. The proportion of the commercial cuts, however, was not changed. The increase of the crude glycerin levels linearly increased the proportion of carcass fat and reduced the muscle proportion, without changing the proportion of bone and the edible portion of the carcasses. The ratio muscle/fat reduced linearly with the advance of crude glycerin level of diets. The color of the meat, evaluated subjectively, increased linearly with the advance of crude glycerin levels of the diets, from dark red to slightly dark red. The texture, marbling, shear force, thawing loss and cooking loss were not changed by dietary levels of crude glycerin. The inclusion of up to 240 g kg-1 of crude glycerin in the diets increases the proportion of fat without changing the marketable portion of carcasses. The benefits to the meat quality refer to the improvement of color, without changing the other characteristics of economic interest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24478/19818,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Dietetic combination of mannan-oligosaccharides and fructooligosaccharides modifies nitrogen metabolism in dogs,"The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of a mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) and a frutoligosaccharide (FOS) mixture in a 1:1 ratio added to a commercial diet for dogs before the extrusion process on the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of the diets and on the metabolizable energy (ME), nitrogen metabolism (postprandial blood urea curve, organic nitrogen balance, fecal concentration of ammonia and excretion of urinary urea) and fecal fermentation parameters (fecal pH and concentrations of short chain fatty acids). Eighteen adult Beagle dogs were used and randomly distributed into two treatments, being a control diet plus one diet in which the mixture of prebiotics was added before the extrusion of the ration. There was no difference in digestibility, metabolizable energy, fecal ammonia content and short-chain fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric) between the control diet and the one with the addition of prebiotics. However, the dogs supplemented with prebiotics before extrusion, had a lower fecal pH (p < 0,05) compared to those in the control diet and a reduction in the post prandial blood urea concentration (p < 0,01) was also observed in the animals receiving prebiotics, observed by the areas below the curve of urea and its increment. The possible mechanism involved in the effect of prebiotics on the reduction in the concentrations of blood urea is the reduction in the formation and intestinal absorption of ammonia, favored by the reduction of intestinal pH. These findings can be considered in the use of prebiotics in clinical nutrition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23983/19788,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance and carcass traits of different commercial pig lines,"The study objective was to evaluate the performance and the quantitative and qualitative carcass traits of three different commercial pig lines. Seventy-two animals were included, 24 animals of each lineage, 36 females and 36 immunocastrated males, with an initial and final average weight of 26 ± 6.5 kg and 139.49 ± 4.05 kg, respectively. These animals were identified and distributed in randomised blocks in a 2 x 3 factorial analysis (two sexes and three lineages) with three replicates per treatment and four animals per experimental unit. The daily gain (kg), feed conversion (kg kg-1), daily feed intake (kg), carcass weight (kg), backfat thickness (mm), loin depth (mm), lean meat percentage (%) lean beef kilograms (kg), marbling, water loss by leaking (%), water loss by defrosting (%), water loss by cooking (%), shear force (kgf cm2 -1) and objective colour were measured. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and means (Tukey’s test) of 5%. There was no interaction between factors, and evaluating the factors separately did not yield significant differences between the lineages for any of the evaluated parameters. For the gender factor, a difference was obtained only for loin depth during the growth phase, lean meat percentage and defrosting water loss. Overall, the evaluated commercial lines were similar and gender influenced some performance parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23966/19786,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments and six replicates with 20 birds per experimental unit. Concentrations of creatinine, albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, triacylglycerols (TAG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), were evaluated at the ages of 14, 28 and 42 days, with 30 birds evaluated per age. At 14 days, there was no difference serum creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL, triacylglycerols, total proteins or VLDL-C concentrations as compared with control. Albumin concentration was the highest at the MWM inclusion levels of 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0%. At 28 days, triacylglycerols, VLDL-C and LDL-C were the lowestat 7.5% inclusion whereas at 42 days, these same variables were the lowest with addition of 10.0% meal. At 14, 28 and 42 days of age, the VLDL-C, LDL-C and total TAG contents were found to decrease at mango waste meal inclusion levels of 5.0 and 7.5% in the diets, which maybe considered an indicator of improvements in the metabolic conditions of broilers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23979/19821,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Introduction of sugar cane bagasse pellets in diets devoid of long fiber for feedlots finished steers,"The use of diets without roughage in beef feedlot has become common in recent years due to practicality, feasibility and availability of inputs. However, the introduction of roughage that does not harm the operation of the feeding management can bring health benefits to animals and economic gain. This study aimed to evaluate the productive and economic performance of steers finished in feedlot, fed three levels of sugar cane bagasse pellets (SBP) in diets without long-fiber. The treatments consisted of 0%, 7% and 14% of SBP in a mixture of concentrate, comprising 80% whole corn grain plus 20% of a protein core. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. The diet with 0% of SBP promoted lower dry matter intake and weight gain. Feed conversion was similar between treatments, with an average of 6.21 kg-1. The lower dry matter digestibility was found in the diet with 14% of SBP. The introduction of SBP did not change the rumination, averaging 1.9 hours day-1. Animals fed 7% of SBP showed higher fat thickness. Due to the numerical differences between treatments for feed conversion in housing and daily cost of food, the profit margin was maximal in the diet with 0% of SBP, with values of R$ 338.1; R$ 311.6 and R$ 305,1 per animal, respectively 0%, 7% and 14% of SBP. The introduction of SBP promoted improvements in production performance, but did not improve the economic results of steers finished in feedlot.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23914/19822,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The aim was to evaluate the influence of increasing levels of annatto byproduct on the components of sheep body weight. Thirty-two male sheep, not castrated, with initial weight of 23.17 ± 1.45 kg, without a defined breed, were used in randomized blocks in all four treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 g kg?1 of annatto byproduct in the diet dry matter). The increase to 300 g kg?1 of annatto byproduct had a negative linear effect (P < 0.05) for hot carcass weight (kg) and cold carcass weight (kg). Increasing levels of annatto byproduct resulted in a linear reduction (P < 0.05) for palette weight (kg), leg weight (kg), carcass compactness index (kg cm?1), liver weight (kg) and skin weight (kg). The inclusion of annatto byproduct up to 200 g kg?1 of dry matter in sheep diets did not affect the components of sheep body weight.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23553/19784,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A completely randomized design in a factorial 2x2x2, were used, with two levels of protein-energy supplementation, two sex and two genetic groups. Fifty-six animals were used (28 Nellore and 28 crossbred ½ Nellore x ½ Aberdeen Angus), equally divided between males and females, maintained on grazing Brachiariabrizanthacv. Marandu and evaluated in three experimental periods: period 1 = protein-energy supplementation in the dry season; period 2 = protein-energy supplementation during the rainy season; period 3 = only mineral supplementation. In the dry season, they were supplemented with levels of 0.5 and 1% of body weight (BW) and in the rainy season with 0 and 1% BW. Dry matter intake (kg day-1, % BW, g kgBW0.75-1) was estimated. In vivo ultrasound measurements of carcass were: loin eye area (LEA), fat thickness (FT) and rump fat thickness (RFT). There was influence of genetic group and protein-energy supplementation levels on average daily gain (ADG) of animals in period 1 and 2 (P < 0.05). Sex affected the ADG only in period 2, and the males had 754 gday-1 and females, 582 g day-1. There was no interaction of genetic group x sex x supplementation level. At the end of the experimental period (end of period 3), it was found that male animals and crossbred animals ½ Nellore x ½ Aberdeen Angus had higher ADG (716 and 748 g day-1, respectively). The values of dry matter intake (DMI) were influenced by genetic group and sex, in all periods, verifying highest intake in crossbred animals ½ Nellore x ½ Aberdeen Angus, with better feed conversion for crossbred animals. Regarding ultrasound measurements taken on the carcass, the influence of sex on FT and RFT, it was observed, and the males showed higher values, 3.24 and 4.62 mm, respectively. LEA was influenced by protein-energy supplementation levels in the second period, herein animals receiving 1% of BW, showed higher values (56.04 cm2) than those receiving 0.5% of BW supplement (48.38 cm2).

1,1978,Forage production in a natural grassland with limestone and phosphorus dosages,"The objective of this study was to assess forage production in a natural grassland by applying different doses of limestone and phosphorus, and the influence of these applications on soil profile. The treatments consisted of the application of limestone doses of 0.0, 7.2, and 14.4 t ha-1 and phosphorus doses of 0,35, 70, and 140 kg of P2O5 ha-1 on the soil surface. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with split-plots and three replications. The limestone doses were distributed in the main plot and applied only at the beginning of the experiment, whereas the phosphorus doses were distributed in the subplots with subsequent annual maintenance applications. Was used a ruler (cm) for monitoring the growth of pastures and, when grasses reached an average height of 20 cm, forage samples were collected in each subplot and botanical and morphological components were separated and dried until a constant weight was achieved. In the third and fourth assessment years, soil samples were collected in the 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20-cm layers to evaluate the influence of treatments on the chemical properties of the soil. The variables analyzed were related to the production of several components, including fodder, native grasses, leguminous plants, unwanted plants, and dead material, in addition to soil properties such as pH, exchangeable aluminum concentration, and base saturation. There was no interaction between the limestone and phosphorus treatments. The effect of limestone doses on forage production was assessed in the third year, and, in the following year, the intermediate dose of limestone (7.2 t ha-1) produced the highest yield (2,316.1 kg of dry matter [DM] of forage ha-1). The increase in phosphorus doses increased forage production in the second year, and reached yields of up to 2,232 Kg DM ha-1 in the fourth year. In summary, the production of natural pastures was enhanced by the application of 25% of the recommended dose of limestone (7.2 t ha-1), and by the application of 50% of the recommended dose of phosphorus (70 kg P2O5 ha-1). The increase in limestone doses directly affected the chemical properties of the soil by decreasing acidity and exchangeable aluminum, and increasing base saturation, even in deeper layers (0-20 cm). The increase in phosphorus doses did not increase the mobility of this nutrient in the deeper layers of the soil (10-20 cm), and the effects were restricted to a depth of up to 10 cm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23432/19782,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro kinetic parameters of marandu palisadegrass associated with nonfiber carbohydrates,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different levels (0, 10, 20 and 30%) of starch or glucose associated with marandu palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) on its kinetic parameters and fiber digestion by the in vitro gas production technique. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design, with four treatments and six replications for each energy source. The marandu palisadegrass associated with nonfiber carbohydrate levels was incubated in 120 ml bottles, with McDougall buffer and rumen fluid from two rumen-cannulated sheep. Readings were taken of gas pressure within the bottle, and two vials were removed at 24, 48 and 96 hours (h) to assess residual neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The one-pool logistic model was used to estimate the kinetic parameters for pure forage and forage associated with starch, however it was necessary to use the two-pools model when glucose was added. Each 1% of added starch promoted a linear increase in total gas production of 0.2254 ml and a decrease in lag time of 0.2451 h, but did not affect the digestion rate. Glucose levels had a quadratic effect on digestion rate and lag time, with a minimum estimated value for digestion rate of 0.01689 h-1 at a glucose level of 10.07% and a minimum lag time of zero. Starch levels caused a linear reduction in NDF digestion of 0.296% only at 24 h, while glucose levels linearly reduced the NDF digestion in all evaluated times (0.3269, 0.4171 and 0.2340% at 24, 48 and 96 h, respectively). Glucose levels promoted different effects on the in vitro gas production kinetic parameters of marandu palisadegrass compared to starch supplementation, highlighting the prolonged negative effects on NDF digestion.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22994/19780,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Root system and resistance to penetration of Mombaça grass fertilized with nitrogen and irrigated,"High stocking rates in intensive pasture-based animal production systems may compromise the development of the forage roots due to increased resistance in the surface layer. This study tested the hypothesis that an increase in stocking rate resulting from different levels of nitrogen fertilization in irrigated Mombaça grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Mombaça) pasture under intermittent grazing could increase resistance to penetration and consequently the growth of the root system. A split-plot design with randomized blocks and subplots was used, including three replications and the following four treatments: 0, 200, 400 and 800 kg N ha?1 year. Evaluations performed in spring, summer and fall seasons were assigned as subplots. The highest values for area, diameter, length and percentage of root biomass (91.4%) were concentrated at the 0-10 cm soil depth, which is explained by the lower penetration resistance in this layer. Increased stocking rate resulting from increased levels of nitrogen in the Mombaça grass sward does not directly affect the penetration resistance of the soil or root characteristics. However, in the rainy season, higher nitrogen levels lead to increased resistance, as they provide higher cumulative stocking rates in this period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21502/19779,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with four replicates. The following response-variables were calculated: phyllochron (PHYL), leaf appearance rate (LAR), leaf elongation rate (LER), stem elongation rate (SER), leaf senescence rate (LSR), life span of the leaf (LSL), stem length (SL), leaf blade length (LBL), number of dead leaves per tiller (NDLT), and number of living leaves per tiller (NLLT). Farther from the feces, a larger phyllochron period was observed in all seasons. The LSL was greater in winter, especially farther from feces. Closer to feces, higher values were observed for LAR, LER and LBL compared with the sites farther from feces. The SL, SER, and NLLT were lower in the winter compared with the other seasons. In the summer, a greater NDLT value was observed than in the other seasons. The deposition of feces by cattle and the seasons of the year both affect the morphogenesis of B. brizantha cv. Marandu, generating the observed spatial and temporal variability in pasture grass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20397/19778,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Splenic lesions observed in 71 splenectomized dogs: a retrospective study,"The spleen of dogs is frequently affected by disorders that vary from local and systemic origin. The difficulty in associating clinical and gross findings contributes for the choice of total splenectomy as the main treatment, leading to an impairment of the immune and hematopoietic functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathological findings in the spleen of splenectomized dogs during 2008 to 2014 at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital. From the 71 cases analyzed, 97% (69/71) of the dogs were submitted to total splenectomy and 3% (2/71) to partial splenectomy. In 45 (63.4%) of these cases, the histopathological diagnosis was non-neoplastic alterations; only 36.6% (26/71) had a splenic neoplasia. The main non-neoplastic lesions observed were nodular hyperplasia 24.4% (11/45), infarction 22.3% (10/45), and hematoma 20% (9/45). The most frequent tumors were hemangiosarcoma 50% (13/26), histiocytic sarcoma 23% (6/26), and lymphoma 11.5% (3/26). The clinical methods used to diagnose splenic lesions were ultrasonography 88% (63/71), radiography 2.8% (2/71) and exploratory laparotomy 4.2% (3/71). In 4.2% (3/71) the spleen changes were observed during the therapeutic ovariohysterectomy. The results of the present study showed a prevalence of benign disorders in the spleen of splenectomized dogs associated with a high incidence of total splenectomy performed, indicating a difficulty in recognizing the different lesions that can affect the spleen by the veterinarian medical.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23539/19816,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effect of follicular diameter, time of first cleavage and H3K4 methylation on embryo production rates of Bos indicus cattle","This study aimed investigate the relationship between epigenetics, follicular diameter and cleavage speed, by evaluating the developmental potential and occurence of H3K4 monomethylation of early-, intermediate- and late-cleaving Bos indicus embryos from in vitro fertilized oocytes originating from follicles up to 2 mm in diameter or between 4 and 8 mm in diameter. Oocytes (n = 699) from small follicles (? 2 mm) and 639 oocytes from large follicles (4-8 mm) were punched from 1,982 Bos indicus’ slaughterhouse ovaries. After maturation and in vitro fertilization (IVF), the cultured embryos were separated into early (? 28 h post-IVF), intermediate (> 28 h and ? 34 h post-IVF) and late (> 34 h and ? 54 h post-IVF) cleavage groups. Blastocysts were subjected to an immunofluorescence assessment for H3K4me investigation. The blastocyst rate for large follicles (36.3%) was higher than that for small follicles (22.9%, P < 0.05). In addition, blastocyst rates for early and intermediate cleavage groups (45.3% and 33.8%, respectively) were higher than that for late cleavage group (13.5%, P < 0.05). The blastocysts from all groups displayed H3K4me staining by immunofluorescence, particularly intense in what seemed to be trophectoderm cells and weak or absent in cells seemingly from the inner cell mass. For the first time for indicus embryos, data from this study demonstrate that higher blastocyst embryo rates are obtained from embryos that cleave within 34 h after fertilization and from those produced from follicles of 4-8 mm in diameter, indicating a greater ability of these embryos to develop to the stage of embryonic preimplantation. This is the first article demonstrating the occurrence of H3K4me in cattle embryos; its presence in all the evaluated blastocysts suggests that this histone modification plays a key role in maintaining embryo viability at preimplantation stage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23616/19819,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,RAPD-based genotyping of Malassezia pachydermatis from Domestic and wild animals,"Malassezia pachydermatis (M. pachydermatis) is a fungus of importance in human and veterinary medicine. Although a part of the normal microbiota, it can sometimes be present in its pathogenic form, particularly causing otitis and dermatitis in animals. Among human beings, it mainly affects immune compromised patients and newborns, causing simple pustulosis, seborrheic dermatitis, tinea versicolor or fungemia. This study aimed to analyze the genomic polymorphism in M. pachydermatis samples isolated from Canis familiaris (domestic dog), Felis catus (domestic cat), and Myrmecophaga tridactyla (giant anteater). Two hundred and fourteen samples were collected and cultured in Sabouraud agar with chloranphenicol (100mg L-1) and incubated at 37 °C for a period of 7 to 10 days. One hundred and sixty six samples that appeared morphologically comparable to yeast cultures were processed for DNA extraction and PCR was performed for a specific region in the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) of M. pachydermatis. Among these, seven (4.21%) were negative and 159 (95.79%) were positive. Of the 159 positive samples, 102 (64.15%) were from animals with clinical signs and 57 (35.85%) without clinical signs. Fifty-seven samples were selected at random for RAPD-PCR based genotyping and distributed into four genetic groups. Types I and II were more frequent in animals with clinical signs while type III was frequent in healthy animals. Type IV occurred evenly across animals with or without clinical signs. These results indicate differences in pathogenicity of the fungus based on the genotype.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23471/19769,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Risk factors for diarrhea in a cohort of dairy heifer calves reared in individual outdoor hutches in Piraí, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","This study aimed to evaluate the association between diarrhea and risk factors potentially related to diarrhea incidence, such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Eimeria and nematode infection, animal age, failure to transfer passive immunity, type of fertilization (artificial insemination - AI, in vitro production of embryos - IVP and natural breeding), mother (heifer/cow) and birth weight of heifer calves reared in individual outdoor hutches on a dairy farm. The database used in the present study refers to a weekly survey of a cohort of 118 heifer calves from birth to 100 days of age. A logistic generalized additive model (GAM) was fit to evaluate the functional relationship between the risk of diarrhea occurrence and birth weight. For analysis purposes, the database was divided into calves up to 30 days old and calves 31 to 100 days old. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models via generalized estimating equations. All variables were included in the models and were removed oneby-one according to Wald statistics to obtain the final model. The relative risks (RR) and their respective 90% confidence intervals were estimated. The final model for calves up to 30 days old showed that IVP [RR=0.33 (90% CI 0.14; 0.75)] is a protective factor and that Cryptosporidium spp. infection [RR=1.95 (90% CI 1.22; 3.12)] is a risk factor. Although not statistically significant [RR=1.46 (90% CI 0.98; 2.18)], failure to transfer passive immunity increases the risk of diarrhea. The final model for calves 31 - 100 days old showed that IVP [RR=0.50 (90% IC 0.28; 0.89)] and birth weight ? 40 kg [RR=0.65 (90% CI 0.47; 0.89)] are protective factors. In this age group, Cryptosporidium spp. infection has no statistical significance [RR=1.25 (90% CI 0.95; 1.64)]. These results indicate that some of the diarrhea episodes observed in animals up to 30 days old could be explained by Cryptosporidium infection; therefore, better monitoring of these animals is recommended. Greater care in colostrum administration is suggested because animals with hypoglobulinemia are more sensitive to diarrhea occurrence. Although attention should be given to all animals with a low birth weight, special care should be given to those 31 to 100 days old.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23439/19820,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Leptospirosis and brucellosis seroepidemiology in sheep and dogs from non-mechanized rural properties in the northwestern region in the state of Paraná,"Sheep breeding has been important in agribusiness, transforming the Brazilian productive scenario. However, it is still deficient due to the damages caused by infectious diseases. Leptospirosis is a severe disease with global distribution, caused by bacteria from the Leptospira genre affecting both humans and animals. The general infection is unapparent, or its clinical signs, when present, are similar to other infections. Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria from the Brucella genre responsible for reproductive disorders in animals, especially ruminants. The purpose of this paper was to seroepidemiological study of Leptospira spp. and Brucella ovis in sheep and dogs from nonmechanized rural properties from the northwestern region in the state of Paraná, Brazil. In order to detect anti-Leptospira antibodies, microscopic agglutination (MAT) was performed. For anti-Brucella antibodies, the agar gel immunodiffusion assay (AGID) was performed. From the total 542 samples from sheep sera analyzed, 11.25% were considered reagent to Leptospira spp. and 18.26% to Brucella ovis. From the 36 dog samples, 25% were reagent to MAT and AGID. From the 32 properties analyzed, 75% were considered positive for leptospirosis and 56.25% for brucellosis. Antibodies against the most probable serovars were Hardjo (34.42%) and Butembo (44.44%) in sheep and dogs, respectively, and the variable exchange of animals among properties was associated to leptospiric infection (p=0.028) in sheep. Leptospirosis and brucellosis are present in the sheep herd and dogs in the rural properties studied, and such result is a warning of the zoonotic importance and the need to establish sanitary programs directed to these animal species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23323/19815,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects and costs of a strategic selective treatment for controlling ecto - and hemoparasitosis in Holstein Friesian calves,"This work assessed the effectiveness and net operational costs of a strategic selective treatment for controlling ectoparasites (Rhipicephalus microplus, as well as Dermatobia hominis and Cochliomyia hominivorax larvae) and hemoparasites (Anaplasma marginale and Babesia spp.) in Holstein Friesian calves. Thirty calves were equally distributed in two groups: ST) strategic selective treatment and CT) conventional treatment. From birth, calves were monitored biweekly until 12 months of age. The CT group was subjected to parasite control according to directions provided by the veterinarian at the Experimental Farm of the Federal University of Lavras (FE/UFLA), whereas parasite control of the ST group followed criteria we had previously established. The ST group experienced fewer changes in physical traits on average and lower globular volume (GV) than the CT group (p < 0.05). Approximately 23% of ST calves exhibited external omphalitis, compared with 48% CT calves (p < 0.001). Additionally, ST calves were less affected than CT calves (p < 0.05) by R. microplus females and D. hominis larvae. Seropositivity rates from the indirect immunofluorescence reaction for A. marginale and B. bovis were similar for both groups (ST: 85.6% and 87.8%, respectively; CT: 83.2% and 83.2%). Additionally, subclinical (asymptomatic infection) anaplasmosis predominated in both groups during the dry period of the year. The daily average weight gains (DWG) were identical among ST (580 g) and CT (570 g), but the effective operational cost (EOC) was 3.7 times greater in ST (R$ 406.58/animal) compared with CT (R$ 110.90/animal). Laboratory exams to monitor the animals represented the largest share of the cost (82.7%) in ST, whereas drug expenses represented the highest costs (49.8%) in CT. Despite having a greater EOC, ST was more efficient at reducing parasite burdens than CT. Calves in the former group presented fewer R. microplus or D. hominis, and experienced a lower percentage of hemolytic anemia (VG < 24%). However, ST no affected the dynamic of A. marginale- and B. bovis-related infections, indicating that the FE/UFLA may be characterized as enzootically stable for these species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23158/19766,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Molecular detection of Bluetongue Virus (BTV) and Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) in uterine biopsies of dairy cows with or without reproductive problems,"Reproductive performance of dairy cows has a direct impact on herd productivity. Infectious agents, such as Bluetongue Virus (BTV) and Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV), are associated with reproductive failure. However, it remains unknown if these viruses are present in the uterus and cause gestational loss. This study used molecular methods to assess if BTV and BLV can be detected in the uterus of serologically positive dairy cows with a record of abortions, stillbirths and repeat breeding (n=23) and without a record of reproductive problems (n =23). The cows came from three dairy herds of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. BTV was not detected in any of the uterine biopsies. Proviral DNA of BLV was detected in 54.5 % of the seropositive cows, but positivity for BLV in the uterus was not associated with the existence of reproductive problems. In conclusion, this study shows that BLV, but not BTV, is present in the uterus of seropositive cows, regardless of reproductive performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23067/19765,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Long-axis fractional shortening and mitral annulus motion in dogs,"Ventricular systolic dynamics involves the contraction of transverse and longitudinal myocardial fibers. Unfortunately, only the activity of the transverse myocardial fibers is foreseen by the standard systolic echocardiographic parameters. Although strain and strain rate have been used to assess the radial, circumferential and longitudinal planes of cardiac contraction, such analysis requires advanced equipment which is not always available in veterinary medicine. On the contrary, some unusual parameters may be recorded via standard methodology, allowing for the specific evaluation of left ventricular longitudinal contractility. In this study, the longitudinal contractile activity was evaluated using the long-axis fractional shortening and the mitral annulus motion, which were compared with several standard echocardiographic parameters in 14 beagles, including seven with asymptomatic mitral valve disease. The long-axis fractional shortening was positively correlated with both the mitral annulus motion and the end-diastolic left-ventricular diameter. Also, a significant correlation was found to exist between the mitral annulus motion and the left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter, which is likely supportive of its preload dependency. Even though no difference was documented in either mitral annulus motion or long-axis fractional shortening between healthy dogs and dogs with mitral valve disease, the latter only included animals with minimal cardiac remodeling, with no overt compromise of systolic function. Since it is possible to obtain these two parameters with any echocardiographic equipment, their inclusion in the routine exam would probably add information regarding the activity of the longitudinal myocardial fibers, whose functional deterioration supposedly occurs prior to the impairment of transverse fibers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22752/19764,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Assessment of different cut-off values of the ELISA-Typhimurium for the discrimination of swine herds with Salmonella isolation,"Salmonella control programs require the classification of positive herds according with the prevalence of infected pigs. This must be based on diagnostic methods that are reliable, accurate and cost effective. Since serological methods fulfill most of these prerequisites, many countries have adopted indirect ELISA tests to discriminate herds, based on their seroprevalence. In view of that, an in-house indirect ELISA test (ELISA-Typhimurium) previously developed proved to be able to detect sera antibodies against the most prevalent serovars of Salmonella found in Brazilian pig farms. This study aimed to assess different cut-off values of the ELISA-Typhimurium in terms of their correlation with Salmonella isolation results at the herd level. Blood and mesenteric lymph node or rectal swabs were taken from 56 slaughter and 14 grower batches from different farms. Serum was tested using the ELISA-Typhimurium at different cut-off points (OD: 6.87%-40%). A total of 55 slaughter batches had at least one Salmonella-positive sample, and the within-herd prevalence was 64.9% (SE±24.8). All 14-grower batches were negative on Salmonella isolation. The logistic regression demonstrated that at 20% OD the ELISA-Typhimurium test is the best model to predict Salmonella isolation frequency at the herd level. At this cut-off point, the test may be a helpful tool for discriminating Salmonella infected herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22624/19812,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Risk factors associated with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) infection in the semiarid of the state of Paraíba, in the northeast region of Brazil","Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has become an important viral infectious agent in cows and is considered endemic in many regions. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological status of BVDV in bovine herds in the semiarid state of Paraíba, in northeastern Brazil, by determining the frequency of anti-BVDV antibodies and risk factors associated with the infection. We tested 359 cows from 20 farms. Three had a history of clinically suspected bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) or mucosal disease (MD), whereas the other 17 locations were randomly selected. Detection of anti-BVDV antibodies was performed by indirect ELISA using a commercial kit (IDEXX BVDV p80 Ab Test). Risk factor analysis was performed in two steps, univariate and multivariate analysis. Seven samples were considered suspicious and were excluded from the analysis of seropositive animals. Of 352 animals, 141 (40.1 %; CI 95 % = 34. 9% – 45.2 %) were seropositive. Of the 20 farms analyzed, 19 (95%) had seropositive animals and the frequency of seropositivity per farm varied between 4.5 % and 85.7 %. The risk factors identified were as follows: area ? 120 hectares (OR = 3.06; CI 9 5% = 1.43 – 6.53), high animal density (OR = 3.48; CI 95 % = 1.24-9.79), weaning age ? 60 days (OR = 10.99; CI 95 % = 1.31-91.9), exchange of animals (OR = 4.95; CI 95 % = 2.08-11.8), calf mortality > 5% (OR = 2.33; CI 95 % = 1.07-5.11), and use of natural breeding and artificial insemination (OR = 3.06; CI 95 % = 1.22 – 7.67). It was suggested that to avoid the transmission of BVDV infection in bovine herds in the Sertão of Paraíba, it is important to prevent identified associated risk factors and to perform further studies, identifying persistently infected animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22493/19762,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. in domestic dogs from Toledo, Paraná, Brazil","Leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by Leishmania protozoa affecting various vertebrate hosts, including humans and dogs. Dogs represent the most important domestic reservoir of leishmaniasis. For this reason, the aim of this study was to detect the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. in dogs being treated at the veterinary hospital of our institution. Samples were obtained from 175 animals by jugular or cephalic venipuncture, and serum was subsequently separated. Anti-Leishmania spp. IgG antibodies were detected in these specimens using indirect immunofluorescence. This revealed that of the 175 serum samples, those of four (2.28%) animals reacted positively and the antibodies title was 40. These data are consistent with the transmission of Leishmania spp. in the region, suggesting that dogs represent a reservoir of American cutaneous leishmaniasis. This is the first description of circulating antibodies against Leishmania spp. in the West region of Paraná State.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22030/19761,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Morphological, morphometric and histochemical aspects of the labial salivary glands of dogs","The knowledge regarding labial salivary glands is becoming progressively more important, as their application in autologous transplantion, to promote ocular surface lubrication, are an ever-increasing procedure in veterinary medicine. In this study the labial salivary gland was collected, as a single piece, along with the oral mucosa from 10 adult dog cadavers. The sample was removed from the left lower lip marked by the second premolar tooth and extended until the distal edge of the second molar. Morphological, morphometric and histochemical evalutations were performed in the rostral, medial and caudal regions of the sample. The study revealed exocrine, compound, tubuloacinar, mixed and predominantly mucous glands with the presence of serous demilunes associated with a few mucous secreting units, and a duct system formed by intralobular intercalated and striated ducts, interlobular ducts, and a main excretory duct. In the rostral region, there was a lower amount of parenchyma compared to other areas, and the diameter of the acini unvaried in all regions. All three regions of the sample were PAS and Alcian blue positive, demonstrating the presence of neutral, carboxylated, and sulphated mucins.

1,1978,Efficiency of boiling and four other methods for genomic DNA extraction of deteriorating spore-forming bacteria from milk,"The spore-forming microbiota is mainly responsible for the deterioration of pasteurized milk with long shelf life in the United States. The identification of these microorganisms, using molecular tools, is of particular importance for the maintenance of the quality of milk. However, these molecular techniques are not only costly but also labor-intensive and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of boiling in conjunction with four other methods for the genomic DNA extraction of sporulated bacteria with proteolytic and lipolytic potential isolated from raw milk in the states of Paraná and Maranhão, Brazil. Protocols based on cellular lysis by enzymatic digestion, phenolic extraction, microwave-heating, as well as the use of guanidine isothiocyanate were used. This study proposes a method involving simple boiling for the extraction of genomic DNA from these microorganisms. Variations in the quality and yield of the extracted DNA among these methods were observed. However, both the cell lysis protocol by enzymatic digestion (commercial kit) and the simple boiling method proposed in this study yielded sufficient DNA for successfully carrying out the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the rpoB and 16S rRNA genes for all 11 strains of microorganisms tested. Other protocols failed to yield sufficient quantity and quality of DNA from all microorganisms tested, since only a few strains have showed positive results by PCR, thereby hindering the search for new microorganisms. Thus, the simple boiling method for DNA extraction from sporulated bacteria in spoiled milk showed the same efficacy as that of the commercial kit. Moreover, the method is inexpensive, easy to perform, and much less time-consuming.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24630/19810,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of natural and artificial drying of leaf biomassof Psidium guajava on the content and chemical composition of essential oil,"Psidium guajava L. is native to Central and South America. It is widely distributed and well adapted to Brazil, a producer of essential oils rich in terpenes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of natural and artificial drying on the content and chemical composition of the essential oil of guava leaves (Psidium guajava L.) grown in Rio Verde (GO). The two treatments consisted of drying fresh leaves either naturally in the shade or artificially at 40°C. Chemical composition was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by gas coupled with mass spectrometer chromatography (GC/MS) and gas chromatography using a flame ionizer (GC-FID), respectively. The method of drying changed the content and chemical composition of the essential oil of guava leaves. Drying in the shade reduced the content and altered the constituents of the essential oil, whereas drying in an oven at 40°C, despite having reduced the amounts of the constituents, exhibited the highest essential oil content and increased the concentration of certain major constituents as compared to that in the natural shade drying method. The major components found in the essential oil of leaves regardless of the drying processes were trans-caryophyllene, ?-humulene, aromadendrene, ?-selinene, and selin-11-en-4?-ol. According to reports in the literature, these compounds possess fungicidal, insecticidal, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activity, among others beneficial actions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23028/19758,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Soil chemical alterations of a Dystroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol) treated with an alkaline effluent from a pharmaceutical industry,"Effluents from different industrial supply conglomerates are often discarded in the environment without proper treatment. The concern for an economically viable industrial production line, which is both environmentally sound and socially acceptable, is increasing. Some of these effluents are alkaline in nature and may be used as an alternative to chemical conditioners for acidic soils in agricultural systems. This research aimed to evaluate changes in the chemical attributes of a Dystroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol) after application of an effluent from a pharmaceutical industry. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using PVC tubes of 1-m length and a 0.2-m diameter filled with soil and different doses of the effluent. After 3 days, 100 mm of water was applied to each treatment. The PVC tubes were incubated for 30 days; thereafter, the tubes disassembled, and soil chemical analyses were made at different soil depths: 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and 0.8-1.0 m. The effluent applications significantly altered the soil elements in the 0-0.2 m layer, increasing the concentrations of K+, P, Mn2+, Na+, Cu2+, H+, Ca2+, Al3+ and the soil pH. In the subsurface layers, the concentration of the elements Zn2+, Cu2+, K+, and Na+ also changed significantly. In general, the application of pharmaceutical industry residue improved soil chemical attributes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23078/19755,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Glycerol as a cryoprotectant agent to the entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis spp. and Steinernema spp.,"The difficulty of storage and conservation of entomopathogenic nematodes (ENPs) is one of the major obstacles for the expansion of its use in the control of biological pest and in the maintenance of collections of these organisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate cryopreservation as a storage and conservation method for ENPs, using glycerol as cryoprotectant. Infective juveniles (IJs) of the species Heterorhabditis amazonensis (RSC 05), H. bacteriophora (HP88), Steinernema feltiae (Sn) and S. carpocapse (IBCB-n02) were subjected to the following treatments: (A) immersion in glycerol at different concentrations (10, 13 and 15%); (B) different exposure times of the isolates to glycerol (24 and 48 hours); and (C) two freezing times in liquid nitrogen (LN) at –196 ºC (24 and 168 hours). Each treatment was replicated four times, and the design was completely randomized in a factorial 3x2x2 (glycerol concentrations x glycerol exposure time x freezing time in LN). IJs survival was evaluated after each exposure time to glycerol and freezing time in LN. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were compared by the Tukey test. S. feltiae and S. carpocapse survived when exposed to glycerol at 10, 13 and 15% for 24 and 48 hours. After storage in LN for 24 and 168 hours, only S. feltiae survived when exposed to glycerol for 48 hours at concentrations of 10, 13 and 15%, with 40.5; 58.2; and 57.7% survival, respectively. S. feltiae was able to infect Galleria mellonella larvae after freezing. However, for the freezing time of 168 hours, 90% reduction in infectivity was observed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23000/19753,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Chemical properties of an Oxisol after gypsum application,"Gypsum utilization is a critical practice in agriculture because of the high solubility and consequent relative neutralization of subsurface toxic aluminum. However, it has been observed that in most cases, gypsum is being randomly utilized without scientifically established parameters or even the need to use it as a soil amendment at all. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition and electrical conductivity of an Oxisol’s saturation extract under different gypsum doses (0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Mg ha-1). This experiment was conducted in a greenhouse environment. Soil columns (V = 1.57 dm3) were filled with sifted (2 mm) soil collected from the upper layer (0-20 cm). The experimental design adopted was completely randomized with five repetitions. The treatments consisted of a 5 × 2 factorial through five gypsum doses (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Mg ha-1 of gypsum consisting of 224.1 g kg-1 S, 314.8 g kg-1 CaO, and 7 g kg-1 P2O5) and two depth evaluations (0-10 and 10-20 cm). After the treatments, soil from both 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers was removed from the columns, sifted once (2 mm), and subjected to vacuum extraction to assess the saturation extract. The data acquired was processed and submitted to variance analysis (when due) and adjusted to regression equations when statistically relevant. Significant increases were observed for Ca, Mg, K, P, and S, although Al, Si, and pH presented no statistically significant difference. The electrical conductivity value of this soil in particular is directly related to the gypsum dose.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23022/19754,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Genetic divergence among accessions of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) sampled in the Tapajós region, State of Pará, using agronomic characters and microsatellite markers","The aim of this work was to estimate the genetic divergence among accessions of cassava sampled in the Tapajós region in the State of Pará, Brazil, and conserved at the Regional Germplasm Bank of Eastern Amazon, using agronomic descriptors and molecular markers. Twenty-two accessions of cassava were evaluated in the field for two successive years, based on six agronomic descriptors in twelve-months-old plants without a specific experimental design. Accessions were also evaluated with eleven microsatellite loci in an automatic DNA analyser. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Based on principal components analysis, the character weight of the aerial portion of the plant contributed most to the phenotypical variation. The six traits were used in the analysis of genetic dissimilarity between accessions, and the correlation between matrices generated by morphological and molecular data was estimated. The matrices of genetic dissimilarity were used in the construction of dendrograms using the UPGMA method. We observed a high variation of agronomical descriptors and molecular markers evaluated, which were capable to separate the accessions into distinct groups. A weak positive correlation was detected among the two matrices of genetic distances, which indicates the possibility to explore the genetic diversity using crossings and accessions Amarelinha 36 and Olho roxo 13 are divergent and potentially promising for the generation of heterotic hybrids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22958/19751,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Adsorption of cadmium and copper in representative soils of Eastern Amazonia, Brazil","Studies of heavy metals adsorption in soil play a key role in predicting environmental susceptibility to contamination by toxic elements. The objective of this study was to evaluate cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) adsorption in surface and subsurface soil. Samples of six soils: Xanthic Hapludox (XH1 and XH2), Typic Hapludox (TH), Typic Rhodudalf (TR), Typic Fluvaquent (TF), and Amazonian dark earths (ADE) from Eastern Amazonian, Brazil. The soils were selected for chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization and to determine the adsorption by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. All soils characterized as kaolinitic, and among them, XH1 and XH2 showed the lowest fertility. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms revealed a higher Cu (H curve) than Cd (L curve) adsorption. Parameters of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms indicate that soils TR, TF and ADE has the greatest capacity and affinity for metal adsorption. Correlation between the curve adsorption parameters and the soil attributes indicates that the pH, CEC, OM and MnO variables had the best influence on metal retention. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms satisfactorily described Cu and Cd soil adsorption, where TR, TF and ADE has a lower vulnerability to metal input to the environment. Besides the pH, CEC and OM the MnO had a significant effect on Cu and Cd adsorption in Amazon soils.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22967/19752,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Shading of stock plants and the use of auxin in red pitaya cuttings,"Although there has been a significant expansion of red pitaya cultivation in Brazil and other countries around the world, its cultivation requires scientific expertise to identify the plant production systems best suited to Brazilian soils and climate. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of exogenous auxin and shading of the parental stock plants on the subsequent quality of red pitaya cuttings. The use of a commercial rooting auxin (with and without) and five shading levels on stock plants (full sun, 35, 50, 65 and 80% shading) were tested via four randomized blocks in a factorial 2x5 scheme with two plants per plot. After 90 days, the following vegetative characteristics were evaluated: length of the longest root (LR), root dry mass (RDM), root width (RW), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and shoot dry weight (SDW), total dry weight (TDW), number of axillary shoots (NAS), sum of the length of the axillary shoots (SLAS), and shoot:root ratio (SRR). We concluded that for the production of high quality plants, collecting cuttings from stock plants grown in full sun or 80% shade is recommended, eliminating the need to use commercial rooting auxin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22865/19750,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Wheat production performance in response to nitrogen sidedressing and molybdenum leaf application,"The application of nitrogen (N) at the appropriate time can be effective for crop productivity, changing the grain yield by increasing yield components. Thus, new alternatives that enable a better application of N fertilizer are sought. The aim of this study was to evaluate the components of yield and productivity of wheat cultivated with different doses of N sidedressing and molybdenum (Mo) via leaf application, using two cultivars, CD 150 and Quartzo. The experiment was conducted in the crop years of 2013 and 2014. The experiment used a randomized, factorial 4 x 4 block design, with four replicates. Four doses of N sidedressing in the form of urea were applied (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg ha-1) during tillering. In the same period, leaf molybdic fertilizer was applied, using four dosages of Mo in the form of potassium molybdate (0, 20, 40, and 60 g ha-1). Grain number per ear (GNPE), 1,000-grain mass (TGM), hectoliter weight (HW), and grain productivity (PROD) were evaluated. N fertilizer sidedressing did not promote the yield components of either of the wheat cultivars, although the GNPE of the Quartzo cultivar increased with increasing N doses in both crop years. The increase in N fertilizer increased the PROD of both wheat cultivars. The foliar application of Mo did not promote the yield components or wheat PROD of either cultivar. The HW was influenced by N and Mo rates, and was reduced in the absence of either of these fertilizer elements, indicating that the two nutrients were dependent on each other.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22824/19749,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Pressure compensation by a floppy disk in a sprinkler with rotation by centrifugal action,"Water wastage is a great concern worldwide. Water is effectively utilized by using equipment and systems that have more uniform water distribution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the FR Super 10 sprinkler with a pressure compensator under different pressures, spacing, and installation heights. The tests were performed in the laboratory, and pressure was controlled with two gauges calibrated with a mercury column. The distribution uniformity was measured using the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC) and distribution uniformity coefficient (CUD). Four spray nozzles were utilized for the Super 10 sprinkler, at two heights (0.6 and 1.2 m), six pressures (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 m H2O), and six spacings (9 × 9, 9 × 10, 10 × 10, 9 × 12, 10 × 12, and 12 × 12 m). The blue, yellow, and red nozzles presented self-compensating features and the green nozzle was not fully self-compensating. The manufacturing coefficients of variations were lower in the nozzles with smaller apertures (blue and yellow) compared to those with larger apertures. Increasing the sprinkler height provided better water distribution uniformity and a better radial distribution profile, lowering the application rate near the sprinkler. Since this sprinkler compensates for pressure changes, pressure did not influence the sprinkler range.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22625/19748,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Preliminary design of a coffee harvester,"Design of an agricultural machine is a highly complex process due to interactions between the operator, machine, and environment. Mountain coffee plantations constitute an economic sector that requires huge investments for the development of agricultural machinery to improve the harvesting and post-harvesting processes and to overcome the scarcity of work forces in the fields. The aim of this study was to develop a preliminary design for a virtual prototype of a coffee fruit harvester. In this study, a project methodology was applied and adapted for the development of the following steps: project planning, informational design, conceptual design, and preliminary design. The construction of a morphological matrix made it possible to obtain a list of different mechanisms with specific functions. The union between these mechanisms resulted in variants, which were weighed to attribute scores for each selected criterion. From each designated proposal, two variants with the best scores were selected and this permitted the preparation of the preliminary design of both variants. The archetype was divided in two parts, namely the hydraulically articulated arms and the harvesting system that consisted of the vibration mechanism and the detachment mechanism. The proposed innovation involves the use of parallel rods, which were fixed in a plane and rectangular metal sheet. In this step, dimensions including a maximum length of 4.7 m, a minimum length of 3.3 m, and a total height of 2.15 m were identified based on the functioning of the harvester in relation to the coupling point of the tractor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22611/19808,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Growth regulators and substrates for Oncidium baueri Lindl. micropropagation,"An adequate concentration of growth regulators as well as the replacement of agar by an alternative medium may be promising from practical and financial points of view to produce orchid plants by micropropagation. The objective of this work was to evaluate different concentrations of growth regulator and alternative substrates for agar replacement in culture medium for in vitro multiplication and rooting of Oncidium baueri. In the explant multiplication phase, two experimental factors were evaluated- various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg L-1) and substrates (agar, vermiculite, and coconut fiber) added to MS medium. In the rooting phase, different concentrations of indole butyric acid (IBA) (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg L-1) were added to culture medium containing the same substrate. Six months after the experiments were initiated, the survival percentage, number of leaves, shoots, and roots and length of the aerial part and the major root were evaluated. The results suggested that addition of 1.0 mg L-1 BAP is necessary for the O. baueri in vitro multiplication phase, but IBA is not necessary in the rooting phase. For the substrate, vermiculite is not indicated as an agar replacement. In contrast, coconut fiber can be used in both multiplication and rooting phases of Oncidium baueri in vitro culture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22291/19744,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Herbicide selectivity in the early development of Alexander palm and peach palm,"Herbicides are an efficient weed-control method, and herbicide selectivity with regard to palm species is an important subject of agricultural research. Owing to a lack of studies in the literature regarding the use of herbicides on palm trees, especially during the early stages of growth, the present study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of some herbicides during the early development of Alexander palm (Archontophoenix alexandrae) and peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) seedlings. The study was conducted in two seasons in a completely randomized design with eight treatments and four repetitions. The herbicide treatments and dosages (g i.a. ha-1), were as follows: fluazifop-p-butyl (93.8), sethoxydim (184.0), quizalofop-p-ethyl (75.0) clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (50.0 + 50.0), fomesafen (225.0), lactofen (168.0), and nicosulfuron (50.0), and a no-herbicide control was included. The seedlings of both types of trees were transplanted into 3.1-L plastic containers. In the first study, herbicide was applied to Alexander palm seedlings of 25–30 cm in height. In the second study, herbicide was applied to Alexander palm seedlings of 30–40 cm in height. Herbicide was applied to peach palm tree seedlings of 40–55 cm in height in both studies. In peach palms only, the herbicides caused slight visible damage during early development. Collectively, the results suggested that all herbicides used are selective and can be used on peach palms during the various stages of development when there are one to four leaves. For Alexander palms, fluazifop-p-butyl, quizalofop-p-ethyl, and lactofen were the only herbicides that did not affect early development during the stages when the plant had one to four leaves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22259/19743,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Micropropagation of Agapanthus umbellatus var. minor by using two systems of multiplication,"For conventional micropropagation methods, semisolidified medium (SM) is used; the use of this medium requires intense manipulation of the cultures and skilled labor. Systems that use liquid medium show equal or better efficiency of the multiplication process, besides reducing the cost for the elimination of agar. In this study, we evaluated the mass propagation of Agapanthus umbellatus var. minor two in vitro multiplication systems (SM system and temporary immersion system [SIT]). The plant material was grown in MS medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA; 0.0, 8.9, 17.8, and 35.6 ?M). The data obtained in this study demonstrate that the two systems used were efficient for the multiplication phase of this species. However, we recommend SIT in view of its reuse in the process of multiplication and rooting. Moreover, simple construction, low cost of the culture medium, and low cost of the bioreactors and the fact that agar is not required qualify this system as an efficient alternative for large-scale micropropagation of Agapanthus umbellatus var. minor. We recommend 17.8 ?M 6-BA for the SM system and 8.9 ?M 6-BA for SIT.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22608/19746,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Application of prediction models of asian soybean rust in two crop seasons, in Londrina, Pr","Predictive models of Asian soybean rust have been described by researchers to estimate favorable responses to epidemics. The prediction strategies are based on weather data obtained during period when initial symptoms of the disease are observed. Therefore, this study will evaluate the application of two prediction models of Asian soybean rust, and compare the results from two harvest seasons. The experiments were carried out during the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons in Londrina, PR. “SIGA spore traps” were installed to monitor the presence of Phakopsora pachyrhizi uredospores, and “Electronic trees,” to collect data on weather variables. Following the detection of the first urediniospores, incidence and disease severity were assessed and compared with the predictions made by the models. The model described by Reis et al. (2004) did not indicate conditions favorable for the development of the first rust lesions following the detection of the first urediniospores during the 2011/2012 season. The premonitory symptoms of rust in the first and second harvest seasons were observed only when the model of Reis et al. (2004) indicated SDVPI close to 15 units. The model of Del Ponte et al. (2006b) overestimated the final rust severity during the two seasons.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21626/19742,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of water salinity and nitrogen fertilization on the growth and yield of ‘BRS Gabriela’ castor beans,"The castor bean has attracted the attention of many farmers as an alternative crop for the National Program of Biofuel and its extensive use in the ricinochemical industry. The crop requires large planting areas to meet the demands of the fuel market. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of irrigation water salinity and nitrogen fertilization on the growth and production of castor beans, ‘BRS Gabriela’, in a protected environment. The present study was conducted at the Center of Technology and Natural Resources of the Federal University of Campina Grande. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 5 × 4 factorial with three replications and one plant per plot. The treatments consisted of irrigation water with five electrical conductivity (ECw) levels of 0.7, 1.7, 2.7, 3.7, and 4.7 dS m-1 associated with four nitrogen levels of 60, 80, 100, and 120 mg of N kg-1 of soil. The interaction between water salinity and nitrogen rates did not exert significant effects on the variables studied. Increased salinity of irrigation water affected the growth in height and stem diameter of castor beans in all periods, and leaf area from 90 days after sowing. Increased nitrogen levels had a positive effect on leaf area at 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after sowing. The total mass of seeds, one hundred seed mass, yield, and number of fruits per plant decreased with the increase in water salinity, and the total mass of seeds was the most affected variable.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22444/19745,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Periods of weed interference in maize crops cultivated in the first and second cycles,"The interference of weeds in maize production may be reflected in grain yield losses that vary as a function of the density, stage and degree of aggressiveness of the species present. In the agricultural ecosystem, crops and weeds demand light, water, nutrients and space, which are frequently not available in sufficient quantities, leading to competition. The aim of this work was to determine the period of interference of weed plants, in particular of naked crabgrass (Digitaria nuda) on maize crop in the first and second harvest. The treatments were defined as increasing periods of coexistence and increasing control of weed community (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days), two more controls, a control including one with weed control until the end of the culture cycle and another with coexistence until the harvest. For each period, were evaluated the stand of maize plants, length of ear, number of grains per row, number of rows per ear, cob, 100-grain weight, and grain productivity. The data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance using the F test, with average treatments compared using Tukey’s test at 5% probability. Crop productivity was evaluated by means of regressions, the critical periods of interference were estimated. The critical timing of weed removal was 25 days for both harvests. The critical weed free period was 54 and 27 days for the first and second harvest respectively. For the conditions of the first and second harvest, the critical period of weed control was of 29 and 2 days respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20336/19741,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight in muskmelons,"Gummy stem blight, caused by Didymella bryoniae, is the most important fungal diseases of muskmelons cultivated in protected environments in Brazil. Fungicides are used to control this disease, and little is known about the effectiveness of alternative control methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight in four muskmelon hybrids. The hybrids Bonus II, Sunrise, Louis and Prince hakusho were grafted onto the squash hybrid Shelper, which is immune to D. bryoniae. Two experiments were conducted, one in greenhouse with artificial inoculation of the pathogen and the other in protected environment using crop residues and soil infected with the pathogen. Under greenhouse conditions, mycelial discs of the pathogen were inoculated onto the hypocotyl or at the union graft/rootstock region of the grafted plants and onto ungrafted plants of each hybrid. By growing these four melon hybrids in a protected environment, the effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight could be studied. When these melons were grown in the greenhouse or in a protected environment, grafting significantly reduced the growth of gummy stem blight in all four melon hybrids. For grafted hybrid plants inoculated at the hypocotyl, the disease severity decreased by 34.1%, 33.8%, 51.1% and 48.0% for Sunrise, Bonus II, Louis and Prince hakusho, respectively, compared to ungrafted plants. For grafted plants inoculated at the union graft/rootstock region, the disease severity decreased by 54.3%, 57.3%, 54.1% and 44.6%, respectively. For melons grown in protected environments, grafting reduced the severity of gummy stem blight in the four melon hybrids by 34.3%, 34.8%, 45.8% and 49.6%, respectively. Thus, grafting onto immune rootstocks significantly reduced the severity of D. bryoniae in the four muskmelon hybrids grown under greenhouse and protected environment conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20080/19740,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Expected response to early-generation selection for yield and tuber appearance traits in potatoes,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of potato clonal families, and to estimate genetic variance, heritability and the expected response to selection of tuber yield and appearance traits in early generations. Twelve potato families were obtained from crosses between two groups of randomly-selected genotypes, including Eliza, C1730-7-94, and C-1742-8-95 in group 1; and Shepody, Asterix, Caesar, and White Lady in group 2. The crosses were made in factorial design (3 genotypes x4 genotypes), and each family consisted of 75 genotypes. Experiments were conducted in the fall of 2010, with a seedling generation under greenhouse conditions, and in the fall of 2011, with a clonal generation under field condition. High heritability estimates suggest that mild to moderate selection can be applied in the seedling generation to eye depth, eyebrow prominence, tuber curvature, flattening and shape uniformity. The C1742-8-95/White Lady stood out as a superior cross, as did all other crosses with White Lady, regarding tuber appearance and yield traits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18226/19739,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,"Cattle movement network, herd size, and bovine brucellosis in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil","The aims of the present study were to compare centrality and other measures of bovine movement networks in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, in 2007, by examination of the positive and negative herds identified in the brucellosis survey conducted in 2003. In addition, we aimed to examine the association between herd size (measured by the number of females older than 24 months, denoted FEM24+) and animal trade between herds. We found a statistical association between brucellosis occurrence and both the total degree (number of traded animals) and out-degree (for the number of animals sold and the number of neighboring herds). This finding suggests that positive herds in the 2003 survey were trading (particularly selling) more frequently in 2007 than negative herds, thereby presumably increasing the risk of disease spread. Statistical differences observed (p-values) in the network of movements for reproduction purposes were more significant than those observed in other networks for average herd size; degrees of animals, batches, and neighbors; outdegree of neighbors; and betweenness. We found positive associations (p < 0.001) between the following variables: number of traded animals and the FEM24+ herd size; FEM24+ herd size and FEM24+ herd size of neighbors within the network of cattle movement; FEM24+ herd size of neighbors and number of traded animals; and weighted degree (animals) of neighbors and degree (animals) of the herd of origin. A comparison of positive and negative herds stratified by herd size (? 10 FEM24+; 11-50 FEM24+; and > 50 FEM24+), within the network of movements for reproduction purposes, revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) in the > 50 FEM24+ category only, for average herd size, total degree (animals, batches, and neighbors), outdegree (animals, batches, and neighbors), and outcloseness. Logistic regression analysis, in which average herd size and degree (animals) were both factors, showed that a tenfold increase in herd size and the number of animals traded would lead to an increased chance of a herd being positive by 41% (OR = 1.41 [1.01; 1.99]) and 39% (OR = 1.39 [1.05; 1.85]), respectively. We concluded that the presence of bovine brucellosis is associated with a larger herd size, which is consistent with other reports. We also found an association between the increased trade of bovines and the presence of bovine brucellosis. Furthermore, an association was noted between herd size and animal trade, both of which could contribute to the spread of brucellosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27206/19944,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of pasteurization on the decay of Mycobacterium bovis in milk cream,"Milk cream must be pasteurized in order to be sold in Brazil. However, there are no specific legal requirements for this product, and producers set their own pasteurization parameters using the ones approved for milk as a reference. Considering that fat protects bacteria from heat, that no thermal inactivation studies have been performed on Mycobacterium bovis present in cream, and that bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Brazil, the aim of this study was to evaluate the inactivation of M. bovis in milk cream subjected to commercial parameters of pasteurization. Milk cream samples were contaminated and pasteurized in a water bath at 75, 80, 85, and 90°C for 5 and 15 s. M. bovis cells were plated onto Stonebrink-Leslie medium, incubated at 36°C for 45 days, and quantified; the result was expressed in log CFU mL-1. The fat content of the samples ranged from 34% to 37% and the average initial load of M. bovis was 8.0 Log CFU mL-1. The average decay of the M. bovis populations was 4.0, 4.3, 4.9 and 6.7 log CFU mL-1 when the cream was incubated for 15 sec at 75, 80, 85 and 90°C, respectively, showing that the efficiency of the heat treatment was improved by increasing the temperature of the process. Given the lipophilic nature of M. bovis, the cream should be subjected to more intense parameters of pasteurization than those applied to milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27327/19940,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Decline in Mycobacterium bovis and Brucella abortus populations during the maturation of experimentally contaminated parmesan-type cheese,"Brazilian legislation allows the manufacture of raw milk cheese with a maturation exceeding 60 days at room temperature above 5°C, but there is a lack of solid scientific evidence on the efficacy of this maturation process in inactivating important pathogens that may be present in milk, such as Mycobacterium bovis and Brucella abortus. Thus, the objectives of this study were to produce parmesan-type cheese experimentally contaminated with M. bovis and B. abortus and evaluate the survival of these pathogens along 2-month maturation. Parmesan-type cheese was manufactured in the laboratory using whole pasteurized milk with or without inoculation with M. bovis (SB1033) or B. abortus (1119-3) and matured at 18°C for up to 63 days. M. bovis was inoculated in Stonebrink-Leslie medium supplemented with antibiotics and incubated at 37°C for 45 days, and B. abortus was incubated in Farrel medium at 36°C for 3 days. The average D18°C value, weighted by variance, was 37.5 ± 5.3 days for M. bovis and 5.9 ± 0.7 days for B. abortus. The average physicochemical parameters in the cheese at the end of the study were as follows: pH = 4.89, water activity = 0.976, and moisture percentage = 43.1%. The pH might have contributed to the reduction in the population of B. abortus but seems not to have influenced the population of M. bovis. We conclude that the duration of the maturation process influences the size of the surviving populations of M. bovis and B. abortus, and that the shortening of the maturation duration might not ensure a decline in pathogen levels to safe levels. Thus, complementary studies considering the effect of several other technological aspects on the survival of these pathogens are required, including the effect of the lactic acid bacterial population, salt content, and temperature of maturation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27326/19950,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mathematical modeling of bovine brucellosis control using the RB51 vaccine,"The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply established the National Program for Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT) in 2001. One of the main strategies adopted by the program is the mandatory vaccination of heifers between three and eight months of age with the B19 strain. In 2007, Brazil allowed the use of RB51 vaccine in bovine females over 8 months of age as an option for the producer, but kept the B19 strain as a mandatory vaccine. This decision is based on the assumption that combining the two vaccines allows to achieve significant vaccination coverage sooner and, consequently, accelerates the fall speed of prevalence. Thus, this study aimed to measure the impact of the combined use of these two vaccines in reducing the prevalence, using as a tool the mathematical modeling. It was concluded that vaccination by RB51, if adopted as a complement to vaccination by B19, mean decrease in the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in less time.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27317/19943,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Decay of Mycobacterium bovis in whole milk submitted to pasteurization parameters,"Parameters for milk pasteurization were established a long time ago, considering the thermal resistance of Mycobacterium bovis, and the systematic adoption of this process has drastically reduced the incidence of human tuberculosis caused by this pathogen. However, more recently, molecular methods have allowed the identification of genetic variations in this bacterium that may lead to greater thermal resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variation leads to variation in the death pattern of this bacterium during the milk pasteurization process. Samples of UHT (ultra-high temperature)-treated whole milk were artificially contaminated with four different Mycobacterium bovis spoligotypes and were subjected to pasteurization by low-temperature long-time (LTLT) and high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatments. The M. bovis spoligotypes were quantified (Colony Forming Unit per milliliter of milk) before and during the thermal process. The decay of the pathogen was quantified by calculating the difference between the measurements at the beginning and at the end of the thermal treatment. The data demonstrated that the LTLT and HTST pasteurization processes considerably reduced the M. bovis load in the milk; however, the bacterium was not eliminated. There was no difference in the thermal resistance of the spoligotypes tested or in the efficiency of pasteurization processes (LTLT versus HTST). However, heating phase was more effective in reducing the M. bovis load than the target temperature maintenance phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27325/19939,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic profiles of Mycobacterium bovis from a cattle herd in southernmost Brazil,"Mycobacterium bovis is the agent of bovine tuberculosis, a disease endemic to all Brazilian states. Molecular typing techniques help to stratify and refine data, providing information that facilitates epidemiological research. In this study, MIRU-VNTR, targeting 24 loci, was employed to identify and characterize the genetic groups of M. bovis isolates obtained from an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis. Eighteen acid-fast bacilli isolates, obtained from bovine tissue samples, and reactive to the comparative cervical tuberculin test, were identified as species of the M. tuberculosis complex, and were genotyped by MIRU-VNTR with 24 primer pairs. Genotyping revealed three genetic profiles comprising one with 15 isolates (83.3%), one with two isolates (11.1%), and one profile with one unique isolate (5.6%). This distinction was achieved with the MIRU 31 primer, which resulted in clustering of two isolates into the same profile, and ETR A, B, and C, which discriminated the isolate with a unique profile. The occurrence of clustered isolates is indicative of recent transmission, whereas isolates with a unique profile suggest reactivation of latent infection. The presence of different M. bovis genotypes in the same herd suggests movement of infected animals or different sources of intra-herd infection. Use of the MIRU-VNTR molecular epidemiology technique in M. bovis isolates obtained from an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in Rio Grande do Sul state demonstrated the genetic diversity of circulating strains, despite the presence of a predominant group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27318/19938,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Comparison of DNA extraction protocols to detect Mycobacterium bovis in bovine tissue by PCR,"The current scenario of international beef trading has increased the pressure for better and faster diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. Although traditional culture remains the gold standard method to confirm Mycobacterium bovis infection, it is exceedingly time consuming, and demands viable mycobacteria. Molecular methods overcome the flaws of the bacteriological methods with faster detection and identification. However, mycobacterial features like a complex cell wall and pathogen–host interaction make the molecular detection a challenge. Three protocols for DNA extraction (A, B and C) from bovine tissues were tested to verify the most suitable technique for routine diagnostic assessment of their specificity and sensitivity. Thirty culture-positive and thirty culture-negative granulomatous lesions were included in the trial. From each sample, three tissue suspensions at different dilutions (10-1, 10-2 and 10-3) were prepared and submitted to DNA extraction. PCR procedures targeting IS6110 were performed, employing two volumes of DNA: 5 µL of all three dilutions, and 2.5 µL of the 10-1 dilution. Protocol A was able to detect members of the M. tuberculosis complex in most samples. The sensitivity of the test decreased with increase in tissue-suspension dilution. Although Protocol A presented the highest sensitivity followed by C and B, it showed the lowest specificity, which can be due to a failure in primary isolation caused by the lack of viable organisms or incubation time. Regardless classical bacteriological methods are still recommended by OIE, after evaluating the sensitivity of DNA extraction protocols and PCR procedures, we conclude that the best strategy for M. bovis detection is to follow Protocol A on concentrated tissue suspensions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27315/19937,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Cryopreservation of Mycobacterium bovis isolates,"Research, development of new biotechnological methods, diagnostic tests, confirmation of results, and reinvestigations are possible because of the availability of well-preserved living organisms maintained without any changes. Cryopreservation is a simpler, more reliable and long-term stable method for culture maintenance. Storage temperature and composition of the suspending vehicle are factors that affect the viability of mycobacterial strains. Three vehicles and three storage temperatures were evaluated to define a suitable cryoprotective medium for the preservation of Mycobacterium bovis strains. Colonies of sixteen M. bovis isolates were used to prepare the suspensions, which were then added to three vehicles: sterile 0.85% saline solution (SS), Middlebrook 7H9 broth (7H9), and Middlebrook 7H9 broth with sodium pyruvate (7H9p) replacing glycerol. Aliquots of these suspensions were frozen by three different methods, directly in the -20°C freezer, directly in the -80°C freezer, and at -196°C by immersion in liquid nitrogen (LN). The frozen aliquots were thawed at room temperature after 45, 90 and 120 days. Mycobacterial viability was assessed by counting the living cells on plates of Stonebrink medium before and after the freezing procedure. Storage at -20°C exhibited a lower recovery of M. bovis compared to storage at -80°C (Dunn’s test, p=0.0018) and LN (Dunn’s test, p=0.0352). There was no statistically significant difference between storage at -80°C and in LN (Dunn’s test, p=0.1403), yet -80°C showed better results than LN. All three suspending vehicles showed no statistically significant difference in terms of viability (Friedman’s test, p=0.7765). Given the low loss proportion of 5% during storage at -20°C and the high cost equipment required for storage at -80°C and LN, we recommend storage at -20°C or -80°C, when this is available, for preservation of M. bovis field strains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27313/19936,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of the incubation conditions on culture media to optimize primary isolation of Mycobacterium bovis,"The isolation of Mycobacterium bovis is critical to a surveillance system for bovine tuberculosis based on detection of lesions in abattoirs. Thus, four solid culture media and three incubation conditions were investigated to elucidate which combination overcomes the others by assessing growth, time to the first appearance of colonies and their number. Ninety-seven samples of granulomatous lesions were submitted to the decontamination procedure by 1-hexadecylpyridinium chloride at 0.75% w/v, and inoculated on two egg-based media, Stonebrink’s (ST) and Löwenstein-Jensen’s with sodium pyruvate (LJp), and two agar-based media, tuberculosis blood agar (B83) and Middlebrook 7H11 medium (7H11). Each medium was incubated at 37°C for 90 days in three incubation conditions: in air, in air containing 10% carbon dioxide (CO2), and in air in slopes closed with burned hydrophobic cotton and subsequently plugged with a cork to create a microaerophilic atmosphere. The colonies appeared faster and in higher number when incubated in air containing 10% CO2 (p < 0.01), independent of media. B83 showed a faster growth and detected more isolates at 30 days of incubation, when compared to ST (0.0178), LJp (p < 0.0001) and 7H11 (p < 0.0001), though there was no difference between B83, ST and LJp at 60 and 90 days of incubation. 7H11 presented the lowest number of isolates (p < 0.0001) and a longer period for the appearance of the first colony (p < 0.001). According to our findings, the concomitant use of ST and B83 media incubated in air containing 10% CO2 increases the isolation of M. bovis in a shorter period of time, which improves bovine tuberculosis diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27316/19935,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Evaluation of  optimal storage time of tuberculous lesions stored in sodium borate,"Preservation of specimens during transportation between abattoirs and diagnostic laboratories defines a critical stage in the definitive diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis by the isolation of Mycobacterium bovis. A 2-step study was designed to verify the maximum time that tissue samples can be stored in saturated sodium borate solution (SSB) with the highest detection of M. bovis isolates. Ninety hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of M. bovis strain AN5 and were humanely euthanized after 40 days. Their spleens were collected and stored in SSB during four distinct periods (30, 60, 90 and 120 days) with incubation at two temperatures (27°C and 37°C). The control group was cultured on the day of euthanasia. Sixty-nine suspected tuberculous lesions samples were collected in the abattoir and were stored in SSB for three periods (30, 60 and 90 days) at 27°C in the laboratory. The bovine control group was cultured on the day of entry in the laboratory. Both experiments were analyzed separately based on the growth proportion of isolates and the number of colonies. SSB was able to maintain the viability of most M. bovis at high temperatures for up to 30 days. A progressive decline was observed with other storage periods at 27°C, and no growth was obtained after 60-day storage at 37°C. Despite the loss in viability of M. bovis, SSB is the most favorable choice to preserve specimens during transportation across a large country with high variation in environmental temperature. The sensitivity of M. bovis detection by bacteriological examination is inversely proportional to storage time. Therefore, the storage of tuberculous lesion specimens in SSB is recommended to not exceed 30 days at 27°C before cultivation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27310/19934,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Prevalence and risk factors for bovine tuberculosis in the State of São Paulo, Brazil","A cross sectional study was carried out between May and November 2011 to investigate the epidemiological situation of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The state was divided into seven regions. Three hundred farms from each region, with reproductive activity, were randomly chosen and included as primary sample units. A fixed number of bovine females, older than 2 years of age, were randomly selected and tested, using the comparative cervical tuberculin test. An epidemiological questionnaire based survey was conducted in the selected farms. Our results show that in the state of São Paulo, the apparent prevalence of positive farms was 9% (95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 7.8 – 10.5%). The prevalence in the individual regions varied between 3.5% (95% CI = 1.7 ? 6.8%) and 13.9% (95% CI = 10.2 – 18.8%). The apparent prevalence of positive animals in the state was 1.3% (95% CI = 0.9 – 1.7%) and varied from 0.3% (95% CI = 0.2 – 0.6%) to 2.5% (95% CI = 1.4 – 4.5%) in the regions. The risk factors associated with tuberculosis in the state were (i) number of adult females in a herd is ? 24 (Odds ratio, OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.32 – 2.75), (ii) type of farm enterprise (dairy: OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.40 – 5.21; mixed: OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.08 – 3.82), (iii) milking process (milking parlor: OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 1.46 – 11.64; portable milking machine: OR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.42 – 6.09), and (iv) pasture sharing (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07 – 2.33). The state of São Paulo should implement a structured surveillance system to detect and mitigate the disease. Further, an efficient animal health education program, which encourages the farmers to test replacement animals for bTB prior to introduction in their herds and to avoid pasture sharing with farms of unknown sanitary conditions should also be implemented.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27283/19933,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiologic characterization of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Rondônia, Brazil","A cross sectional study was performed between June 2009 and March 2010 to determine the situation of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Rondônia. The state was divided into three regions and, in each of them, 300 farms with reproductive activity were randomly chosen and considered as primary sample units. In the selected farms, an epidemiologic questionnaire was applied. A fixed number of bovine females older than two years of age was randomly selected and tested through comparative cervical tuberculin test. Considering the State of Rondônia, the apparent prevalence of bTB positive farms was 2.3% (95% CI = 1.5–3.5%). The prevalence in the regions varied from 1.7% (95% CI = 0.7 – 4%) to 3% (95% CI = 1.6–5.7%). The apparent prevalence of bTB positive animals in the State of Rondônia was 0.12% (95% CI = 0.06–0.25%) and varied from 0.08% (95% CI = 0.04–0.18%) to 0.15% (95% CI = 0.07–0.33%) in the regions. The risk factor associated to tuberculosis in the State of Rondônia was the acquisition of animals (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 1.6–31.1). The State of Rondônia should implement a surveillance system to detect bTB-infected herds to certify them as bTB-free. Moreover, an efficient health education program to inform farmers to test replacement animals for bTB prior to introduction in their herds should also be implemented.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27280/19930,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Prevalence and herd-level risk factors of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Santa Catarina,"With the aim of supporting the strategic planning of the National Program for Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis, different Brazilian states have been conducting cross-sectional studies, coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply and with scientific support from the University of São Paulo and the University of Brasilia. In Santa Catarina, the State Animal Health Agency (CIDASC) conducted a study on bovine tuberculosis (TB) prevalence and assessment of risk factors in 2012. The state was divided into five regions and, in each region, independent sampling was performed in two steps: (i) cattle herds with reproductive activity were randomly selected; and (ii) in each herd, a sample of females aged 24 months or older underwent the intradermal comparative tuberculin test. A questionnaire was used to collect data on production characteristics and management practices that could be associated with the tuberculosis infection. Herd prevalence of bovine TB was 0.50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.074–0.93%) while the prevalence of TB in adult females was 0.06% (95% CI: 0–0.12%). No significant difference in the prevalence of infected herds and of positive females was observed among the five regions. The logistic regression model revealed that herds with 19 or more females showed an odds ratio (OR) of 7.68 (95% CI: 1.22–48.39) compared to smaller herds, while dairy herds presented an OR of 10.43 (95% CI: 2.00–54.25) relative to beef or dual-purpose herds. The results suggest that dairy herds, in which animals are kept in partial or total confinement, and larger herds, which tend to acquire animals more often, are at a higher risk of bovine TB. Given the low prevalence and the type of higher-risk properties, a bovine TB surveillance system should be targeted at the state’s dairy basins, particularly the western region that accounts for the major industries and more intensive dairy farms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27282/19932,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","A study was conducted to determine the epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The state was divided in seven regions, and in each of them, a pre-established number of farms was randomly sampled. In each farm, cows with age equal to or greater than 24 months were selected at random and submitted to the comparative cervical tuberculin test. The animals whose tests were inconclusive were retested with the same diagnostic procedure within a minimum interval of 60 days. In all, 9,895 animals from 1,067 farms were tested. An epidemiological questionnaire was applied in the farms in order to identify risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis. The prevalence of infected herds in the state was 2.8% [1.8; 4.0] and that of infected animals was 0.7% [0.4; 1.0]. There was a trend towards a concentration of infected herds in the northern part of the state, with a predominance of dairy and mixed herds. The risk factors associated with the condition of infected herds were being a dairy herd (OR = 2.90 [1.40; 6.13]) and herds with 16 or more cows (OR = 2.61 [1.20; 5.49]). Thus, the best strategy to be adopted by the state is the implementation of surveillance systems to detect and remediate the infected herds, preferably incorporating elements of risk-based surveillance. In addition, the state must carry out a solid action of health education so that the producers test animals for bovine tuberculosis before introducing them in their herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27281/19931,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Prevalence and herd-level risk factors for bovine tuberculosis in the State of Paraná, Brazil","Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonosis with worldwide distribution. Its control has a direct impact on public health and livestock production. This study estimated the prevalence of infected herds and adult bovines and evaluated risk factors associated with the presence of tuberculosis within herds in the state of Paraná. The state was divided in seven livestock regions and independent sampling was performed. A total of 1,419 farms were sampled and 16,045 animals were tested using the intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin diagnostic test. The apparent and estimated prevalence rates in farms and adult bovine animals were 2.15% (95% CI: 1.31-3.00) and 0.42% (95% CI: 0.04-0.81), respectively. It was not possible to state with 95% confidence that the disease prevalence in any region was significantly different from that in other regions. There were no positive animals in the western region, and the prevalence of positive herds and animals in the other regions ranged from 1.03% to 3.89% and 0.17% to 1.08%, respectively. The logistic regression model identified larger herd size (OR = 2.4) and mechanical cmilking (OR = 5.18) as risk factors associated with the presence of bovine tuberculosis. The combination of low prevalence with risk factors associated to larger herds and more intensive dairy farming, renders the state of Paraná a good candidate for the implementation of industry-based free-herd accreditation schemes and makes a case for planning risk-based surveillance targeted at major dairy basins.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27277/19928,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological situation of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil","The epidemiological situation of bovine tuberculosis was studied in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The state was divided into three regions, and a predetermined number of properties was randomly sampled in each region. In each property, females aged 24 months or older were randomly selected and subjected to the cervical comparative tuberculin test. Altogether, 5,728 animals from 906 properties were tested. In the evaluated properties, an epidemiological questionnaire was applied to identify risk factors related to bovine tuberculosis. The prevalence of infected herds and infected animals and in the state was 2.87% [1.82–4.50] and 0.62% [0.29–1.29], respectively. There was a predominance trend of infected herds in the properties located in the dry areas of Pernambuco, where most dairy properties are found. The risk factors related to the occurrence of positive herds were: presence of 18 or more cows in the herd, milking the cows two or three times a day, and sharing the grazing area. In conclusion, the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in Pernambuco is low, and the best strategy to be adopted is the implementation of a surveillance system for detection and sanitation of infected herds, preferably by incorporating risk-based surveillance strategies. In addition, the State should implement an effective sanitary program to enable producers to test their animals for bovine tuberculosis before inserting them into the herds, as well as avoid sharing the grazing areas with properties that are not free of bovine tuberculosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27267/19927,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Prevalence and herd-level risk factors of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Goiás, Brazil","Bovine tuberculosis results in economic losses in livestock production and poses a risk to public health. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis in adult cows in the state of Goiás, Brazil. The state was divided into three sampling strata, corresponding to different livestock production circuits. A total of 18,659 animals were tested with the comparative cervical tuberculin test (CCT), in 300 randomly sampled bovine herds per stratum. An epidemiological questionnaire was used to identify health and management practices that may be associated with the presence of tuberculosis infection in the herd. In Stratum 1, dominated by beef cattle, no animals reacted to the CCT. In Stratum 2, which covers the main dairy regions of the state, the prevalence was estimated at 8.67% [5.73 to 12.74%] for herds and at 0.9% [0.21 to 1.58%] for animals. In Stratum 3, characterized by a mix of dairy, beef and dual-purpose herds, the prevalence was estimated at 1.00% [0.21 to 2.89] for herds and 0.30% [0.10 to 0.49 %] for animals. The overall prevalence in the state of Goiás was 3.43% [2.20 to 4.67%] for herds and 0.30% [0.10 to 0.49%] for animals. The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that herd-level risk factors associated with the presence of the bovine tuberculosis are: the location of the herd in Stratum 2 (OR = 12.05 [3.52 to 41.28]) and the number of times a cow is milked per day (OR = 6.27 [2.72 to 14.44]). Regular veterinary care was identified as a protective factor (OR = 0.38 [0.15-0.94]). These results indicate that bovine tuberculosis is endemic in the state; its spatial distribution is heterogeneous with a strong concentration in dairy regions. The most intensive dairy farms are those with the highest risk, which is consistent with what other authors’ found elsewhere in Brazil. The epidemiological information generated by this study provides information for planning of risk-based surveillance actions, and justifies the adoption of free-herd certification programs for bovine tuberculosis in the main dairy regions of Goiás.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27278/19929,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In total, 17,121 animals from 938 properties were tested. In cases of inconclusive results, the animals were retested with the same diagnostic procedure within a minimum interval of 60 days. An epidemiological questionnaire was administered in the properties sampled to investigate possible risk factors for the disease. In the State, the prevalence of infected herds was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72–2.37%) and that of infected animals was 0.035% (95% CI: 0.017–0.069%). Point estimates indicated a higher concentration of infected herds (2.61%; 95% CI: 1.31–5.15%) and infected animals (0.132%; 95% CI: 0.055–0.315%) in the Planalto Sul region, which has a predominance of dairy properties. The prevalence of herds infected with bovine tuberculosis was found to be associated with the production of milk, with technification in the mode of production represented by the use of mechanical milking.

1,1978,"Epidemiological situation of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil","In 2009, the epidemiological situation of bovine tuberculosis was studied in the state of Mato Grosso, which is a traditional beef exporter. The state was divided into four regions. In each region, properties were selected randomly. A predetermined random number of animals were chosen from these properties, and comparative cervical tuberculin tests were conducted. In total, 28,878 animals from 1,133 properties underwent examination. The animals with inconclusive results were reexamined with the same diagnostic procedure in a minimal interval of 60 days.

In the state, the prevalence of infected herds and animals was 1.3% [0.7; 2.4] and 0.12% [0.03; 0.44], respectively. Further, the prevalence of infected herds and animals were 0.0% [0.0; 2.0] and 0.0% [0.0; 0.08] in the Pantanal region, 1.3% [0.5; 3.1] and 0.04% [0.01; 0.17] in the dairy region, 0.7% [0.2; 2.7] and 0.01% [0.003; 0.04] in the fattening region, and 1.7% [0.7; 4.1] and 0.24% [0.06; 0.90] in the breeding region, respectively. It was observed that the condition of the herds infected with bovine tuberculosis was associated with milk production, European or mestizo breeds, degree of sophistication in the production mode, and herd size of up to 486 animals.

The risk factors associated with tuberculosis prevalence in Espírito Santo were the number of adult females ? 10 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.17-5.31) and milking type (milking machine/milking parlor) (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.36-5.86]). The state of Espírito Santo should set up a surveillance system to detect and control bovine tuberculosis, taking into account the importance of dairy farms and animal trade in the state.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27262/19884,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis in the Federal District of Brazil,"Considering the implementation of the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Animal Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT) in 2001, and the need to determine the epidemiological status of animal tuberculosis for future evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures laid down, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and identify risk factors of bovine tuberculosis in the Federal District (DF) of Brazil, as well as to provide an input for the strategic management of PNCEBT. Field testing and data collection was carried out from February to December 2003. The DF was considered a single epidemiological region owing to the small number of existing farms, and the absence of significant differences between the region’s farming enterprises, which would justify the stratification of the regional sample. A total of 278 farms were randomly sampled from the local registry database of bovine farms with reproductive activity, in which 2,019 adult cows were tuberculin tested. Only one sampled animal had a positive result, using the comparative cervical tuberculin test, resulting in a bovine tuberculosis prevalence of 0.05% [95% CI: 0.0-0.4%]. The herd-level prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in the DF was estimated as 0.36% [95% CI: 0-2.0%]. The analysis of risk factors was impaired by the results obtained, as the number of cases did not allow for this kind of analysis. Cattle farming in the DF is predominantly aimed at dairy production; however, it is characterized by the presence of small low milk yield herds, which may not favor the introduction and persistency of infection of Mycobacterium bovis. Health authorities from the DF perform surveillance for bovine tuberculosis and maintain the need for tests for the movement of bovines for breeding and those animals destined for any form of animal gathering, especially auctions. Therefore, it is likely that the DF has good conditions for successfully implementing the PNCEBT.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27261/19924,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2013","A cross sectional study was performed to assess the epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2013. The state was divided into seven regions, and a preset number of herds was randomly sampled in each region. From each farm, female cattle aged 24 months or older were randomly sampled and subjected to the comparative cervical tuberculin test (CCTT). Animals with inconclusive test results were re-tested with the same diagnostic procedure after a minimum interval of 60 days. A total of 31?832 animals were tested from 2?182 farms. An epidemiological questionnaire was administered in the farms to identify risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis. Prevalence in the state was estimated at 4.25% (95% CI: 3.36% – 5.15%) for herds and at 0.56% (95% CI: 0.46% – 0.66%) for animals. Data on herd prevalence for bovine tuberculosis for each stratum showed the highest prevalences at region Sul e Sudoeste (stratum 5) and region Central (stratum 3) which were significantly different from the lowest prevalences found at regions Noroeste, Norte e Nordeste (stratum 1) and region Leste (stratum 2). The highest animal prevalences observed for the region Sul e Sudoeste (stratum 5), region Zona da Mata (stratum 4) and region Central (stratum 3) were significantly different from the lowest ones at region Triângulo Mineiro (stratum 7), region Noroeste, Norte, e Nordeste (stratum 1) and region Leste (stratum 2). The presence of bovine tuberculosis was associated with animal purchase from cattle traders (OR?=?2.59 [95% CI: 1.28 – 5.20]), higher yield intensive dairy (OR?=?7.55 [95% CI: 1.89% – 30.09%]) and non-intensive dairy production (OR?=?3.58 [95% CI: 1.06% – 12.04%]), as well as with herds with 30 or more cows (OR?=?1.97 [95% CI: 1.02 – 3.80]). Non-specific reactors to the CCTT were found in 95.07% (95% CI: 94.05% - 96.09%) of the herds. Therefore, the state of Minas Gerais should implement surveillance systems for the detection and sanitation of infected herds, preferably incorporating risk-based surveillance elements, considering the results of the present study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27405/19922,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Epidemiological situation of bovine brucellosis after implementation of a vaccination program in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil","This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a bovine brucellosis vaccination program in Rio Grande do Sul, with prevalence as the indicator, and to identify risk factors for the disease. The state was divided into seven regions. For each region, a predetermined number of properties were randomly sampled, in which a pre-established number of randomly selected females aged over 24 months were tested. The serodiagnosis protocol consisted of a screening test using buffered acidified antigen, followed by a confirmatory test using 2-mercaptoethanol. An epidemiological questionnaire was utilized to identify possible risk factors associated with bovine brucellosis. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the prevalence of infected herds was found to be 3.54% [2.49-4.88], and the prevalence of infected animals was 0.98% [0.57-1.57]. In assessments of specific regions, the infected herd prevalence ranged from 0.66% to 3.09%, and among the animals, from 0.06% to 2.03%. In herds comprising 15 or more cows, beef type and pasture sharing emerged as risk factors for bovine brucellosis in the state. The epidemiological status of bovine brucellosis in Rio Grande do Sul has remained unchanged since 2004, even though adequate vaccination coverage has been recorded since 2009. Thus, the state should continue its vaccination program, with emphasis on the quality of the process and on encouraging the use of non-antibody inducing vaccines. In addition, the state must make a greater effort to educate producers on the importance of testing for brucellosis in breeding animals before introducing them onto their properties, and on the importance of avoiding shared grazing among herds whose health conditions are unknown.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27238/19911,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Controlling bovine brucellosis in the state of São Paulo, Brazil: results after ten years of a vaccination program","A cross- sectional study was carried out, between May and November 2011, to estimate the situation of the bovine brucellosis in São Paulo State, 10 years after the commencement of the vaccination of the heifers with the S19 strain. The State was divided into seven regions and in each of them, 300 farms with reproductive activity were randomly chosen and considered as primary sample units. A fixed number of cows was randomly selected and tested for antibodies against Brucella spp. A farm was considered infected if at least one female tested positive. In the selected farms, an epidemiological questionnaire was administered which focused on herd traits as well as husbandry and sanitary practices that could be associated with the risk of infection. The prevalence (percentile, [95% confidence interval]) of infected herds was 10.2% [8.8-11.8] for the State, and for the regions, it varied from 7.3% [4.7-11.2] to 12.3% [8.8-16.8], not showing significant difference between different regions. The apparent prevalence of positive farms in the State and regions remained similar to the prevalence observed 10 years before. The prevalence of positive animals was 2.4% [1.8-3.1] in the State and varied from 1.1% [0.6-2] to 3.5% [1.7-7.1] in the regions, not showing significant difference between regions. Again, there was no difference in the prevalence of positive animals after 10 years of the vaccination program. The risk factors (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval) associated with bovine brucellosis in the State included number of cows ? 24 (3.08, 2.22-4.27) and the acquisition of breeding animals (1.33, 0.95-1.87). The São Paulo State should conduct systematic vaccination coverage of above 80% of the eligible heifers with the S19 strain vaccine annually. Moreover, the State should emphatically use RB51 strain vaccine in females above 8 months of age not vaccinated with S19 strain vaccine. An efficient animal health education program to orientate farmers to test replacement animals for brucellosis prior to introduction in their herds should also be implemented.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27233/19921,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effect of vaccination in lowering bovine brucellosis in the State of Rondônia, Brazil","The study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccination program against bovine brucellosis, implemented by the State of Rondônia, using prevalence rates as an indicator. The State was divided into three regions. For each region, a pre-determined number of herds were selected and at each herds, blood samples were collected from randomly chosen females with 24 months age or more. Sera from animals were submitted to a serial testing protocol, with screening performed using the buffered acidified antigen test and confirmation by the complement fixation test. A epidemiological questionnaire was administered to each farm property to identify the risk factors associated with the disease. The prevalence rates of infected herds and infected animal at the state were 12.3% [10.3–14.6] and was 1.9% [1.4–2.5], respectively. Between the regions, the prevalence of infected herds varied from 11.6% to 12.8% and the prevalence of infected animals ranged between 1.4% and 2.6%. Bovine brucellosis in Rondônia State is associated with the beef herd, a larger number of cows and the presence of flooded pastures. There was an important reduction in prevalence rates of infected herds and infected animals since 2004, however further reduction could still be achieved with vaccination. Thus, the State should continue its vaccination program, placing emphasis on ensuring the quality of the process. In addition, it should also promote the use of a vaccine that does not induce antibody formation. Additionally, the State must carry out a great effort of education so that producers test breeding animals for brucellosis before introducing them onto their properties and, where possible, prevent calved cows from having access to areas that are flooded.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27232/19920,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Seroprevalence and risk factors for bovine brucellosis in Minas Gerais State, Brazil","This cross-sectional study was conducted in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil in 2011 to estimate the seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis (Brucella abortus) in properties and cattle, and to identify potential infection risk factors for herds with cows of reproductive age. The state was divided into seven regions: 1. Noroeste, Norte and Nordeste; 2. Leste; 3. Central; 4. Zona da Mata; 5. Sul and Sudoeste; 6. Alto Paranaíba; and 7. Triângulo Mineiro. Random, two-stage sampling was performed of both properties and cattle from each property. Blood samples were collected from 18,990 cows of reproductive age from 2,185 properties. The serologic tests used for the detection of anti-B. abortus antibodies included the buffered, acidified plate antigen test, as a screening test, with the 2-mercaptoethanol reduction, test as a confirmatory test, as recommended by the Programa Nacional de Controle e Erradicação da Brucelose e Tuberculose Animal - PNCEBT (National Program for the Control and Eradication of Animal Brucellosis and Tuberculosis). The seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis on the surveyed properties and in cattle were 3.59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76 4.42%) and 0.81% (95% CI: 0.05-1.10%), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the total number of cows in the property as a risk factor for the presence of anti-B. abortus antibodies, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.93 (95% CI: 1.12 - 3.34) for herds with 30 to 210 cows and 7.81 (95% CI: 3.72-16.38) for those with more than 210 cows, relative to the risk in herds with less than 30 cows, the base category. While these results demonstrate a significant reduction in the prevalence of properties with bovine brucellosis, the disease is still present in Minas Gerais, with properties with higher numbers of cows at higher risk for infection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27226/19917,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effect of vaccination in lowering the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil","The study was conducted to verify the efficacy of the bovine brucellosis vaccination program implemented by the state of Mato Grosso, using prevalence as an indicator. The state was divided into four regions: Pantanal, Milk, Fattening, and Breeding. For each region, a predetermined number of properties were selected and blood samples were taken from randomly chosen female animals, aged 24 months or greater. Sera from the animals were initially screened with a buffered acidified plate antigen, and confirmed using complement fixation. In each property, a questionnaire was used in order to identify the risk factors associated with the disease. In the state, the prevalence rate of infected herds was 24.0% [21.3; 26.8] and the prevalence rate of infected animals was 5.1% [3.5; 7.2]. The prevalence rates of infected herds and animals in each region were as follows: 21.2% and 6.4% in the Pantanal region, 17.2% and 3.7% in the Milk region, 34.0% and 7.2% in the Fattening region, and 24.3% and 4.4% in the Breeding region. Bovine brucellosis in the state is associated with the introduction of breeding, herd size, pasture sharing, and farms used for mixed and beef purposes. Therefore, in order to improve control of bovine brucellosis, it is proposed that the state of Mato Grosso intensify its prophylactic program, primarily its vaccination strategy. There has been a reduction in the prevalence of infected herds since 2002; however, there remains a high prevalence of infected herds and animals throughout the state. Additionally, the use of non-inducing antibodies vaccine should be encouraged, especially in the Pantanal region where the management of the animals is complicated by the flood and ebb cycle. The state should make greater efforts to educate producers on how to assess the breeding animals for brucellosis before introducing them into their properties as well as avoid shared grazing among herds of unknown health conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27229/19919,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study was carried out 11 years after the implementation of the immunization program for heifers with a vaccine derived from the S19 strain of Brucella abortus. The state was divided into two regions. Three hundred farms from each region, with reproductive activity, were randomly chosen and included as primary sample units. A fixed number of cows were randomly selected and tested for antibodies against Brucella spp. A farm was considered to be infected when at least one female tested positive for Brucella spp. In the selected farms, an epidemiological questionnaire based survey, focused on herd traits as well as husbandry and sanitary practices, was conducted, to evaluate the factors associated with the risk of infection. The overall prevalence of infected herds was 9.3% (95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 7.1–11.8%), varying from 8.7% (95% CI = 5.7–12.6%) in region 2 to 9.7% (95% CI = 6.8–13.4%) in region 1. There was no significant difference in the prevalence between the regions. The apparent prevalence of Brucella spp. positive farms across the regions and the state was similar to the prevalence observed 11 years earlier. The prevalence of positive animals was 3.8% (95% CI = 0.9–10.1%), varying from 1.5% (95% CI = 0.8–2.4%) in region 1 to 7.9% (95% CI = 1.9–20.3%) in region 2, without a significant difference between the regions.

1,1978,Quality indicators of tank milk in different production systems of tropical regions,"Research was conducted in eight commercial herds located in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Properties were classified according to the production system, the seasons were divided into four and the genetic groups into six. Milk samples from morning milking were collected monthly, directly from a cooling tank. Protein, fat, lactose, total solids, casein, urea nitrogen concentrations/levels, somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) were determined. For milk composition, the detected results were satisfactory and met the requirements of Normative Ruling 62, but the averages for SCC and TBC were above the recommended limit. All variables, with the exception of casein from total protein were influenced (P < 0.05) by the production system used in the production unit. A lower fat content was recorded in 2010 compared to 2011. For the seasons, all the constituents of milk had lower values in drier season (seasons 3 and 4), with the exception of casein; SCC and TBC had higher values in periods 1 and 2, which are considered rainy periods. There was variation in the chemical composition of milk according to the genotypes. Milk chemical composition met the legal and market requirements, with a positive emphasis on specialized production systems. The variations over the year and according to the genetic group of the herd are also significant and should be taken into account in the search for improvements. As for the hygiene and health aspects of milk, the results portray the need for a greater focus by the entities involved in the sector, as well as the producers, on the viability of an adequacy program and monitoring of management practices related to this criterion.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25355/19627,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effect of slow release urea in sheep feed on intake, nutrient digestibility, and ruminal parameters","This study aimed to evaluate the inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% slow release urea (SRU) in sheep feed on the intake and total digestibility coefficient (DC) of nutrients and ruminal parameters of sheep living in tropical regions. Four sheep with a body weight (BW) average of 30.8 ± 1.7 kg were assigned to a Latin square design. The animals were placed in metabolic cages and received two meals a day. Intake data and DC of nutrients of the sheep were subjected to analysis of variance and differences were tested using a regression equation to 5% probability. The inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% SRU in sheep feed did not change (p > 0.05) the intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral or acid detergent fiber (NDF, ADF), total carbohydrates (TC), and non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) expressed in g animal-1 day-1, g (kg0.75)-1, and % BW. The mean values of 3.04%, 2.82%, 0.41%, 0.07%, 1.36%, 0.87%, 2.31%, and 1.00% of BW were obtained for the intake of DM, OM, CP, EE, ANF, ADF, TC, and NFC, respectively. The inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% of SRU in sheep rations had a quadratic manner (p < 0.05) the DC of DM and CP, with maximum values of 69.67% and 63.59%, respectively, for 0.51% and 0.66% levels of SRU inclusion in the experimental diets. The pH of the rumen fluid did not vary (p > 0.05) for different levels of inclusion of SRU in the feed. However, the pH of the rumen fluid did differ (p < 0.05) in relation to time (T) after feeding for all experimental diets. The inclusion levels of SRU in sheep feed did not affect (p > 0.05) the concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) of the rumen fluid, but there was a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) with relation to T for all experimental diets. Thus, we conclude that the inclusion of 0.66% SRU provides the best digestibility value of CP and is the appropriate value for the digestion of DM. The inclusion of up to 1.2% of SRU in sheep rations did not change the intake of nutrients and ruminal parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25230/19625,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In situ degradability of elephant grass ensiled with increasing levels of pineapple agro-industrial by-product,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the in situ degradability of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and hemicellulose of elephant grass (Pennisetumpurpureum, Schum.) with increasing levels (0; 35.0; 70.0, 105.0, and 140.0 g kg-1) of dried pineapple (Ananascomosus, L.) by-product (DPBP). The experimental silos consisted of plastic drums with 210 L capacity. After weighing and homogenizing the elephant grass with the DABP, the material was inserted in the silos (126 kg silage, at a density of 600 kg m-3) and compressed. After 45 days of ensilage, silos were opened and samples of the silages were collected for the trial. The study of degradability in situ was conducted using a rumen-fistulated male cattle. The animal was fed with corn silage supplemented with 1 kg concentrate daily. Five levels of addition of the by-product were tested, with three replicates and five times of incubation with an animal. The experimental design was completely randomized with split plots, in which the proportions of DPBP were the treatments (plots), the different silos were the replicates, and the incubation times were the subplots. The levels of inclusion of DPBP provided an increase (P < 0.05) in disappearance of DM and CP and in the effective degradability of DM, NDF, ADF, and hemicellulose. The dried pineapple by-product is a potential alternative to be used as additive in the ensilage of elephant grass, as it provides an increase in the rumen degradability parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25238/19626,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fatty acid profile of milk from cows fed palm kernel cake,"To evaluate the fatty acid profile of milk from cows fed palm kernel cake (PKC), 12 Holstein × Zebu crossbred cows were kept in the feedlot, distributed into a triple 4 × 4 Latin square, and fed the following treatments: 1) control; 2) inclusion of 50 g PKC/kg in the total dry matter (TDM); 3) inclusion of 100 g PKC/kg in the TDM; and 4) inclusion of 150 g PKC/kg in the TDM. Milk samples from the morning and afternoon milkings were collected in the amount of 1% of the daily production of each animal; subsequently, 100-mL subsamples were frozen for analysis of the fatty acid profile. Inclusion of PKC did not change the concentration of short-chain fatty acids or myristoleic (C14:1), pentadecenoic (C15:1), palmitic (C16:0), and palmitoleic (C16:1) fatty acids. Concentrations of medium-chain and lauric (C12:0) and myristic (C14:0) fatty acids increased linearly (P < 0.05). A decreasing linear effect was observed (P < 0.05) on the concentration of the C15:0 fatty acid. No effects were observed (P > 0.05) on the long-chain fatty acids and those of the omega 6 and 3 series; on the ratio between poly-unsaturated and saturated fatty acids; or on the ratio between the fatty acids of the omega 6/omega 3 series. The concentration of conjugated linoleic acid was not influenced (P > 0.05) by inclusion of PKC in the diet. Addition of palm kernel cake to the diet of lactating cows influences the concentration of medium-chain fatty acids, and of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), and pentadecanoic (C15:0) fatty acids in their milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24816/19623,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physiological and behavioral responses of Nellore steers to artificial shading in an intensive production system,"The influence of artificial shading on environmental variables and on behavioral responses of Nellore steers in an intensive production system was evaluated in this study. The experiment was conducted in the experimental feedlot of the Department of Animal Science at Universidade Estadual de Goiás, from July to October 2014. Forty-eight male Nellore cattle with an average initial weight of 310 kg were kept in double 24-m2 stalls, in a total of 24 stalls. Of these, six were in the open air; six were covered with black shade netting of 30% light interception; six with black shade netting 50%; and six with black shade netting 80%, providing 6 m2 of shade per stall. Temperature-humidity index (THI) and respiratory frequency (RF) were assessed twice weekly and behavior was evaluated fortnightly during 12 h, between 06:00 h and 18.00 h. Feeding behavior, rumination, rest, and social activities such as body care and playful and abnormal activities were observed. A significant increase was found in THI and RF as the shading levels decreased, while a significant difference was recorded in rest and in other activities, water intake, and play behavior. Rest time and playful behavior increased significantly, and other activities and water intake decreased with the increase in shading levels. Shading does not change the time spent on feeding behaviors and rumination, or the frequencies of urination, defecation, cleaning other animals, self-cleaning, and social and abnormal types of behavior. The use of black shade netting of 80% light interception provides greater comfort to animals, promoting welfare and quality of life to them.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25040/19624,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic group and heterosis on morphometric measurements during the growth of male beef cattle,"In the present study, the effects of genetic group and heterosis on body measurements of purebreds (Charolais - C and Nellore - N), first-generation crossbreds (G1) (1/2C1/2N and 1/2N1/2C), and second-generation crossbreds (G2) (3/4C1/4N and 3/4N1/4C) males from rotational crossbreeding were evaluated at 8, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Among the purebreds, the Nellore displayed greater rump height than the Charolais. The Charolais had greater thoracic perimeter than the Nellore, however this difference decreased gradually with advancing age, being equal between the two genetic groups at 24 months. For width of the rump, ischial opening and thoracic perimeter crossbred animals showed higher values than the purebred animals at all ages, but less pronounced at eight months of age. For all morphometric measurements, with exception of rump height, the differences of crossbreds males in relation to the purebreds, were more evident in relation to the Nellore. Heterosis was significant for morphometric measurements in male beef cattle. Morphometric measurements showed high correlation with each other and with body weight, thereby indicating that they are good indicators of body development.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24727/19658,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Growth curves on females of the Caracu breed,"The objective of the study was to analyze nonlinear models that best fit the growth of Caracu cows. The experiment was conducted at the Instituto de Zootecnia, Centro APTA Bovinos de Corte, Sertãozinho, SP. Data of weight at birth to 63 months of age, from 500 females of the Caracu breed were used. The mean weight at birth (BW), weaning weight (W7), weight at 26 months (W26) and weight at 63 months (W63) were, respectively, 32 kg, 198 kg, 354 kg and 488 kg, providing an average daily gain (ADG) of 0.241 kg/day. The nonlinear models used were: Brody, Von Bertalanffy, Logistic and Gompertz. All of the models tended to describe accordingly the growth curve of these animals, but, according to the mean square residual and coefficient of determination adopted to select the most appropriate model, Brody showed the best fit. All models presented a high and negative correlation between the A and k parameters, indicating that the most precocious animals are less likely to reach elevated weights at 63 months of age. The effect of year of birth significantly affected (P < 0.01) the parameters A and k, concluding that the animal selection based on growth traits favored the increase of mature weight and growth precocity over the generations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24476/19621,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carcass characteristics of lambs fed diets with mulberry hay,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo quantitative traits of carcass and commercial cuts of lambs fed diets containing 0, 12.5, and 25.0% mulberry hay replacing the concentrate. Twentyfour Ile de France lambs at approximately 60 days of age, with 15 kg body weight, were confined in individual stalls and slaughtered at 32 kg. Increasing levels of mulberry hay in the diet resulted in a linear increase in chest depth (R2=0.84), leg muscularity index (R2=0.71), and muscle:bone ratio (R2=0.95); a linear decrease in leg compactness index (R2 =0.75), shoulder weight (R2=0.78), and femur weight (R2=0.99) and length (R2=0.86); and a quadratic response from chilling losses (R2=1.0) and percentage of intermuscular fat.

1,1978,Mass and nutritional quality of upper and lower strata of tropical forages,"The goal of this work was to evaluate the growth dynamics and chemical characteristics of the upper and lower strata of summer perennial grasses under a four cuts system. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, composed of 28 treatments in a factorial arrangement of 7x4, with four repetitions. The cultivars evaluated were Star Grass, Coast-cross, Tifton 68, Tifton 85, Jiggs, Roxinha and Quicuio. Each cultivar was cut when it reached 95% light interception. The cultivars Jiggs and Tifton 68 had the highest (P < 0.05) accumulation of dry biomass ha-1 during the four cuts, with productions of 21,348 and 21,016 kg ha-1, respectively. The ash content varied (P < 0.05) among species and times of cutting for both strata. Cellulose contents were significantly different in the upper stratum, with the highest concentrations found in cvs. Quicuio and Tifton 68 (39.12% and 38.07%, respectively). We found the highest levels of lignin (P < 0.05), for both strata, in cv. Quicuio. Cultivars Jiggs and Tifton 68 were the most appropriate for a management system of four cuts, displaying good chemical composition and high productivity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23964/19619,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carcass and non-carcass component characteristics of lambs fed with cassava wastewater dregs in replacement of corn,"The objective was to evaluate the effect of the substitution (0, 33, 66 and 100%) of corn by cassava wastewater dregs on carcass characteristics and non-carcass components of crossbred Santa Inês lambs. Forty male sheep, uncastrated with an average initial body weight of 20 ± 1.87 kg and five months of age, were used. These were housed in individual pens in a randomized block design with four treatments and ten repetitions and slaughtered after 70 days of confinement. Quadratic effect (P < 0.05) was observed for the empty body weight (EBW), hot carcass weight (HCW) and cold carcass weight (CCW) and carcass compactness index (CCI), with maximum points of 36.14, 19.45, 20.20 and 0.31 kg cm-1 for the replacement level of corn for cassava wastewater dregs, 50.0, 53.84, 54.04 and 45.45% respectively. There was also an effect (P < 0.05) on the weights of the rumen and “Buchada”, with maximum points of 0.909 and 6.25 kg per replacement level, 49.11 and 51.29% respectively. As for retail cuts, only the efficiency of the leg was altered (P < 0.05), having a linear increase while the other variables were not affected. Cassava wastewater dregs can be used in full as an alternative food in the diet of feedlot lambs without harming the main carcass characteristics and non-carcass components.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23940/19618,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Levels of metabolizable energy and digestible lysine for broiler chicks 1-10 days of age,"This study evaluated the effect of different levels of metabolizable energy (ME) and digestible lysine (DL) on the rate of protein deposition, rate deposition body fat and intestinal morphology of broiler chicks 1 to 10 days of age. The study design consisted of 1,152 broilers, weighing 52 ± 5 g, distributed in a completely randomized, 4x4 factorial design, consisting of four levels of ME (2700; 2825; 2950 and 3075 kcal/kg) and four levels of DL (1,080; 1,187; 1,295 and 1,403%), with 16 treatments and three replicates, with 24 poultry in each experimental unit. The protein deposition rate (PDR) and fat deposition rate (FDR) were not affected (P > 0.05) by the ME, however, PDR was influenced linearly (P < 0.05) by increasing lysine. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between the levels of ME and DL, whose increase resulted in a higher villus height of the duodenum, jejunum and a greater relation villus: crypt ratio of the ileum. Therefore, levels of DL and ME had positive effects on the intestinal development of broiler chicks in the pre-starter phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23903/19656,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Symbiotics and Aloe vera and Symphytum officinale extracts in broiler feed,"This study aimed to test the effects of dietary Aloe vera and Symphytum officinale extracts added separately or in combination with symbiotics on the performance, nutrient utilization, serum biochemical parameters, biometrics, and intestinal histomorfometry of broilers. The experiment had a randomized block design with five treatments and six replicates of ten broilers each. Treatments were as follows: negative control and positive control (diet without and with antibiotic, respectively); 0.2% Aloe vera (AV); 0.2% Symphytum officinale (S); 0.2% functional supplement, composed of symbiotics fermented in Aloe vera and comfrey plant extracts (S+PE). At seven days of age, FI of birds fed the Aloe vera extracts diets were lower than that observed for birds consuming the diet with Symphytum officinale extract and S+PE. Broiler performance remained unaffected by treatments at others ages evaluated. At 10 to 14 days of age the lowest ADCDM ADCCP was shown in group feed NC. The highest ADCCP was observed in PC control group and in diets supplemented with Aloe vera and S+PE. Serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phosphorus were affected by addition of extracts at seven, 21, and 35 days of age. The longest duodenal villi were observed in broilers fed S+PE diets at seven days of age. Aloe vera and Symphytum officinale extracts and symbiotics can be used in broiler diets as an alternative to growth-promoting antibiotics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23873/19615,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nutritional assessment of waste of cassava starch extraction dried in cattle feed,"This study aimed to evaluate the digestive power of waste of cassava starch extraction dried (WCSEd) and corn, in addition to determining the appropriate level of WCSEd to replace corn in the diet of cattle. Studies to evaluate the in vitro digestibility and in situ degradability were performed. The study used four cattle with rumen cannula, individually fed with diets containing increasing levels (0, 33, 66 and 100%) of WCSEd to replace corn, to evaluate the dry matter and nutrient intake and digestibility, pH and ammonia concentration of rumen fluid. The WCSEd showed differences in the in vitro digestibility of DM, OM and NDF (P < 0.05) compared to corn, but did not change the NDT and in situ degradability. As for in vivo reviews, the DM and nutrient intake was influenced by treatments in decreasing order, resulting in changes in the digestibility of DM, OM and NDT of diet, and a decreased concentration of N-NH3, but the pH was not affected. The residue from the extraction of cassava starch showed lower in vitro digestibility; however, ruminal degradability did not differ from corn. Their use in ruminant feed reduces the intake and degradation of feed, but improves the use of N-NH3 in the rumen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23718/19655,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Energy and protein requirements of crossbred Holstein x Zebu steers fed different levels of calcium and phosphorus in the diet,"The aim of this study was to determine the energy and protein requirements of crossbred Holstein x Zebu steers fed with or without the supplementation of dicalcium phosphate in the diet. Thirty-two steers with an average initial body weight of 377.5 ± 49.4 kg were used, of which four were initially slaughtered to estimate the empty body weight (EBW) of the animals. Twenty-four steers were fed ad libitum and were distributed in a completely randomized design with two levels of concentrate (30 and 60 %), and diets with or without dicalcium phosphate and four steers were fed at maintenance level, so that the body weight gain was equal to zero. After 84 days the animals were slaughtered. The animal tissues were sampled, and composted by two samples, denominated by “carcass” (bone, muscle and fat) and “non-carcass” (head, limbs, blood, hide, organs and viscera) for determination of the body composition. The net energy requirements (NEm) and metabolizable energy for maintenance (MEm) were obtained while relating heat production (HP) and metabolizable energy intake (MEI); meanwhile, the net energy requirements for gain (NEg) and the net protein requirements for gain (NPg) were obtained as a function of empty body weight (EBW), empty body gain (EBG) and retained energy (RE) in EBW. The daily net and metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance were 76.90 and 119.36 kcal/EBW0.75, respectively. The net energy requirements for gain can be obtained by the following equation: NEg = 0.0568±0.0025 × EBW0.75 × EBG1.095. The efficiencies of use of metabolizable energy for maintenance and gain are 64.4 and 29.68 %, respectively. The metabolizable protein requirements for maintenance are 4.14 g/BW0.75. The net protein requirements for gain can be obtained through the following equation: NPg = 236.36±30.06 × EBG - 19.84±6.14 × RE. We recommend the use of the equations obtained in this experiment to calculate the energy and protein requirements of crossbred Holstein x Zebu steers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23831/19614,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Multivariate analysis of lactose content in milk of Holstein and Jersey cows1,"This study evaluated the factors influencing the variation in the lactose content of milk in Holstein and Jersey herds in Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, using multivariate analysis. Data from 73 dairy herds in the Dairy Herds Improvement Program of the State of Santa Catarina were provided by the Santa Catarina Association of Cattle Breeders (ACCB). A total of 46,242 monthly records of Holstein and Jersey (59 and 41 % of the total records, respectively) cows from 2009 to 2012 were analyzed using multiple correspondence, factor, and cluster analyses. Lactose content was observed to correlate with somatic cell count and parity, whereas the evaluated breeds, as well as the production and concentrations of fat and protein in the milk, were not associated with the lactose content. The cows were categorized into three groups, the first consisting of cows of both breeds with low lactose content (4.19), high somatic cell score (5.82), and higher parity (2.50), contrasting with two other groups each with mean values characteristic for Holstein and Jersey breeds, respectively. Analysis of cows without subclinical mastitis ( < 200,000 somatic cells ml-1) revealed that the relationship of parity with lactose level was independent of the effect of somatic cells. Lactose contents less than 4.4 % were observed in autumn. Overall, the present study suggests that the lactose content of milk is influenced by somatic cell count and parity and that it varies seasonally; however, it is not related to breed, milk yield, milk fat content, or milk protein level.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23677/19612,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Feeding behavior in lambs fed diets containing crambe cake,"It was evaluated the feeding behavior of lambs fed diets containing 30% sorghum silage and 70% crambe cake (30:70 diet), and 70% sorghum silage and 30% crambe cake (70:30 diet) under voluntary and controlled consumption. The experimental design used was a 4 × 4 Latin square, with four animals, four periods, and four treatments; feeding behavior was determined by observation. The results indicated that animals fed the 30:70 diet showed higher DM and NDF (g day-1) than those fed the 70:30 diet. Animals fed the 70:30 diet showed longer feeding times (h kg-1 DM), mastication (min kg-1 DM and min kg-1 NDF), rumination (min day-1 and min kg-1 DM), and the largest number of mericics chewing per bolus; however, a higher feed efficiency (g DM h-1) was observed in the 30:70 diet group. Furthermore, animals feeding voluntarily had higher DM intake and chewed for longer. Therefore, the combined results indicated that crambe cake could be used in the diet of sheep without affecting feeding behavior.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23669/19654,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance of Nellore males under different artificial shading levels in the feedlot,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of artificial shading on weight gain and meat quality of male Nellore cattle in an intensive production system. The experiment was conducted in the experimental feedlot of the Course of Animal Science at Universidade Estadual de Goiás, from July to October 2014. Forty-eight male Nellore cattle with an average initial weight of 310 kg were kept in double 24-m2 stalls, in a total of 24 stalls. Of these, six were in the open air; six were covered with black shade netting of 30% light interception; six with black shade netting 50%; and six with black shade netting 80%, providing 6 m2 of shade per stall. The ration supplied to the animals and the orts left in the trough were weighed daily to determine intake, and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was measured twice weekly. Animals were weighed for the first time at the start of the experiment, and then another three times until the end, which was followed by the slaughter and assessments of performance and meat quality. A difference (p < 0.05) was observed between the average THI values, with the highest value found in the stalls without artificial shading. No difference (p > 0.05) was observed for feed intake, initial weight, final weight, total weight gain, average daily weight gain, carcass yield, marbling, texture, fatness, backfat thickness, loin-eye area, color, thigh length and circumference, leg length and circumference, or carcass length between the animals on the different treatments. The use of artificial shading does not have a significant effect on performance or meat quality of feedlot Nellore cattle when the ambient temperature is within the thermal comfort zone.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23629/19610,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Serum cortisol concentration in cattle of different genetic groups slaughtered in confinement,"The objective of this work was to compare the serum cortisol levels among four genetic cattle groups slaughtered in confinement. Thirty-two non-castrated male bovines from four genetic groups were analyzed: Nelore, Aberdeen Angus × Nelore, Caracu × Nelore, and Guzerá × Nelore. The blood samples were collected on the day of weighing (every 28 days) and during the slaughter. Regarding the concentration of serum cortisol, no significant differences were found among the groups during the first, second, and fourth collections. However, during the third collection and at the day of slaughter, respectively, the Nelore group (3.15 ng/dL; 2.98 ng/dL) showed similarity to the Caracu × Nelore (2.02 ng/dL; 2.07ng/dL) and Guzerá × Nelore (2.33 ng/dL; 2.40 ng/dL) groups. Nelore showed a significant difference compared with the Aberdeen Angus × Nelore group (1.21 ng/dL; 1.61 ng/dL). With respect to the overall collection averages, the Nelore group (2.85 ± 0.87 ng/dL) showed greater values than the Aberdeen Angus × Nelore group (1.61 ± 0.87 ng/dL). However, it showed similarities to the Caracu × Nelore (2.06 ± 1.31 ng/dL) and Guzerá × Nelore (2.48 ± 1.16 ng/dL) groups. It was also observed that animals with low cortisol values gained more weight, as demonstrated by the correlation between ADG and the cortisol collection averages (-0.54; p < 0.05). There was no difference among the groups with respect to shearing strength of the meat, and the correlation between this force and the cortisol collection average (0.15; p > 0.05, ns) showed that meat tenderness in the studied groups was not affected.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23601/19608,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Forage mass and agronomic traits of Elephant grass genotypes under free-growth and conventional cutting systems,"Few grass genotypes with high yield potential are used as fodder in Brazil, making it necessary to develop new cultivars. In this study, we compared tiller density, forage mass, and agronomic traits across 12 Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) genotypes under free-growth and conventional cutting systems at the Agência Paulista de Técnologia dos Agronegócios (APTA), Andradina, São Paulo, Brazil. The experimental design of the two trials was three replicates of a randomized complete block, each experimental unit consisting of 37.5-m2 plots with five rows spaced 1.5 m apart. We estimated tiller density 30, 60, and 150 days after planting (DAP), and 90 days after cut (DAC), and harvested the grass 150 DAP and 90 DAC for determination of forage mass and agronomic traits. In the free-growth system, forage mass was highest in genotypes CNPGL 00-155-2, CNPGL 92-41-1, CNPGL 92-51-1, and CNPGL 96-21-1 and in cultivar Guaçu. After cutting and regrowth, forage mass was highest in genotypes CNPGL 93-41-1, CNPGL 92-41-1, and CNPGL 91-11-2 and in cultivars Mineiro IPEACO, Guaçu, and Pioneiro. Stem mass was higher than leaf mass in the two trials, with leaf/stem ratio in most genotypes below 1.0. Aerial tiller density was highest for genotypes Pioneiro and CNPGL 00-155-2, and stem diameter was smallest in cv. Pioneiro in the free-growth and in the cutting and regrowth systems (9.7 and 7.62 mm, respectively). After regrowth, plant height ranged from 0.56 m in cv. Guaçu to 2.0 m in cv. Mineiro IPEACO and the mean number of internodes.stem-1 ranged from 2.1 in cv. Guaçu to 7.4 in cv. Pioneiro. Forage mass correlated positively with basal tiller density (r =0.4096) and negatively with stem diameter (r =-0.4879) in the free-growth trial, but relationships were not significant after regrowth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23496/19606,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Isotopic of nitrogen and chemical analysis of deferred grazing marandu palisadegrass fertilized with urea and poultry litter,"This study aimed to evaluate and quantify the methodology of stable isotopes, 15N values for the organic fertilizer (chicken manure) and inorganic (urea). In addition to evaluating the incorporation rate, chemical half-life and analysis thereof, for possible traceability through the pasture fertilized with different sources of N. The technique of employment with use of tracer stable isotope 15N possible to estimate the changes in the N soil, even in the face of the various changes that take place concurrently. The methodology determines the path of both N isotopes (15N and 14N), providing information about the system and estimating N transformation rates The experimental work was conducted at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, UNESP Botucatu. An area of 576m2 was used for the parcels, which were divided between the 3 treatments with 4 repetitions each: T1 - control treatment without fertilization; T2 - fertilization with urea and T3 - organic fertilizer with poultry litter. The grass was cut every 15 days, three months after fertilization, for a total of four periods of grazing exclusion. Experimental samples were analyzed for the isotopic nitrogen and crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin composition. Degradation of poultry litter, the sand bag method was analyzed by linear regression. (delta-N-15) forage, fodder percentage of nitrogen, percentage of total nitrogen sheet, (delta-N-15) on the sheet, and (delta-N-15) at the helm were different between treatments. To this end collection, difference was observed for% Total Nitrogen, % Total N in sheet, % Total N in the trunk and% Total N at the helm. The crude protein analysis revealed significant differences between treatments, while the crude protein and lignin differ according to time after fertilization.

1,1978,Evaluation of offspring of dairy sheep given water supplemented with crude glycerin during pregnancy and lactation,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of crude glycerin (CG) supplementation of dairy ewes during pregnancy and early lactation on the body weight and measurements of offspring from birth to weaning. Twenty-four lambs from 24 Lacaune x East Friesian genotype ewes were evaluated. The sheep were distributed in four treatments that differed in crude glycerin supplementation of 0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, and 4.5%, as well as the concomitant adjustment of dry matter and water intake. Body measurements of lambs were recorded every two weeks from birth until weaning. Body weight was recorded daily. Multiple regression analysis revealed that supplementation with CG explained 5.2% of the variation in the weight of lambs at birth (LW), accompanied by the body condition score of the ewe (12.3%), sex of lamb (19.2%), and live weight of the ewes (26.5%); r2 was 63%. According to the predictions of the model adjusted for simulated scenarios, the leanest lambs were derived from ewes weighing between 40 and 50 kg, with body condition scores from 4 to 5, and that did not receive CG at intermediate levels. Heavier lambs, with LW above 5.5 kg, were derived from ewes that weighed between 80 to 90 kg with low body condition scores of 3, and that received 1.5% CG. Supplementation with CG between 2% and 4% improves the weight of the lambs at birth. Body measurements of lambs were not influenced by dietary supplementation of ewes with CG.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23492/19604,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Collaborative study to evaluate the indigestible neutral detergent fiber and indigestible acid detergent fiber contents in feeds by in situ procedure,"The objective of this collaborative study was to evaluate the indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) and indigestible acid detergent fiber (iADF) content in feeds in six laboratories from institutions linked to the National Institute of Science and Technology in Animal Science (INCT-CA). Six feeds were evaluated: signal grass hay, sugarcane, corn silage, soybean meal, corn and citrus pulp. Estimated levels of iNDF and iADF proved to be dependent on the laboratory in which the analysis was performed. It was found that differences between laboratories ranged from 2.40 percentage points for soybean meal to 8.05 percentage points for sugarcane for iNDF analysis and from 1.79 percentage points for corn to 10.06 percentage points for hay for iADF analysis. It was observed that the individual evaluation of each material, the total random variation of the results between laboratories ranged from 88.75 to 96.77% and 88.75 to 98.40% for iNDF and iADF analysis, respectively. The iNDF and iADF levels are dependent on the interaction effect between the evaluated material and laboratory and have low reproducibility; this may be a consequence of the differences between the methods practiced by each laboratory, demonstrating lack of standardization of procedures used by the laboratories.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23546/19607,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of dietary antioxidant supplementation on reproductive characteristics of male broiler breeders during the post-peak production phase,"Because of their membrane constitution, sperm cells of male broiler breeders are prone to lipid peroxidation, which affects their fertilizing capacity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of antioxidant diet supplementation on the reproductive characteristics of 12 male broiler breeders (Cobb) older than 50 weeks. The roosters were randomly distributed in a completely randomized experimental design with two treatments (treatment 1: commercial feed; treatment 2: commercial feed supplemented with canthaxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C) and 6 replicates. Semen samples were collected by abdominal massage, and then underwent evaluation of semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, vigor, and morphology. Morphometric analyses of testes, combs, and dewlaps were performed at 68 weeks. Testes samples were collected for morphometric analysis of seminiferous tubules and analysis of cellular proliferation in the germinal epithelium by using immunohistochemical staining with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (anti-PCNA) antibodies. Statistical data analysis was performed using the SAS software (SAS, 2002). No significant effects of antioxidant supplementation were observed on semen characteristics (p > 0.05). A significant positive effect of the antioxidant blend was observed on the percentage of normal sperm, dewlap weight and width, and testes weight and length (p < 0.05). PCNA-positive cell counts and morphometry of the seminiferous tubules were not affected by the treatment. Dietary antioxidant supplementation may represent a nutritional tool to increase fertility in male broiler breeder flocks during the post-peak production phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23410/19603,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fetal sex influence in the productive performance of dairy cows,"Investigating factors that could affect milk production of cows is an important way to improve the efficiency of production systems. This purpose of this study was to verify and quantify the influence of calf sex on milk production and lactation length in herds of Holstein, Gir, and Guzera cows. Data from 10,780 lactations of 4,807 Holstein cows that calved between 2001 and 2013; 18,898 lactations of 13,172 Gir cows that calved between 1985 and 2013; and 5,277 lactations of 3,972 Guzera cows that calved between 1987 and 2013 were used. Both the accumulated 305-day milk yield (P305) and the length of the lactation period up to 305 days (DL305) were evaluated. Analysis of variance was performed by the least squares method using the GLM procedure in the SAS statistical program. The P305 was not influenced by the sex of the calf in the Holstein breed. However in the zebu breeds (Gir and Guzera), both P305 and DL305 were significantly affected (P < 0.01) by the sex of the calf, with higher production and average length of lactation in cows that calved males. In addition, a significant difference was also nested within sex of calf and age at first calving (P < 0.05) in the Gir breed. The results indicate that for the zebu breeds, calf sex influences production characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23321/19602,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nutrient digestibility parameters as a tool for analysis of the intestinal health of broiler chickens,"The study was performed with the objective of verifying raw soy feed, oxidized oil feed, and a control group. Performance evaluation was done at 7, 14, and 21 days of age. Metabolism assay was carried out between the 17th and 20th days for nutrient digestibility analysis. On the 21st day, two birds per repetition were sent for necropsy and collection of intestine fragments (duodenum and jejunum) for histomorphometric analysis. Eight to 14 days after treatment with Salmonella, individuals showed lower feed intake and feed conversion than the control group. Treatment with coccidiosis decreased all performance parameters in the control. Raw soybeans and oxidized oil induce lower weight gain and higher feed conversion compared to the control feed. Unlike after 14 days, at 21 days treatment with salmonella a decrease in weight gain was noted. For the group challenged by coccidiosis feed intake, the feed conversion remained lower than the control group. Undesirable effects on performance in the groups fed raw soybean and oxidized oil remained at up to 21 days. In the evaluation of digestibility, it was observed that raw soy had lower values for digestibility of dry matter, ether extract, and nitrogen balance due to intake. In addition, a lower ratio of villus:crypt measurements was observed. Lower villus height was found in the duodenum of the group challenged by coccidiosis. This group presented a positive correlation between the digestibility of ether extract and the duodenum, indicating that increased villus height implies an increased digestibility of ether extract. The results obtained for the jejunum showed a positive correlation with villus height in groups challenged by coccidiosis, raw soybeans, and oxidized oil; and to crypt depth in the group challenged with oxidized oil. The information obtained in the present study demonstrates that nutrient digestibility parameters can be useful tools for the analysis of the intestinal health of broiler chickens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23168/19659,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Weight gain and morphometric growth of genetically improved tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum),"Weight gain and morphometric growth of the genetically improved tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) are evaluated. Current assay was carried out on the Fish Farm Experimental Station of the Federal University of Mato Grosso, in the municipality of Santo Antonio de Leverger - MT Brazil. Seven fish families from the breeding program and a control group (not genetically improved) were evaluated. All animals were individually identified with a transmitter-responder label (transponder). Weight gain, overall and standard length, head size, height, width and body perimeter were measured. A completely randomized design was used and comparisons among families and the control group were carried out by Dunnett test at 5% significance level. The genetically improved fish families showed a 14.8% higher weight gain when compared to that of control group. Five out of seven families showed greater weight gain when compared to control group, with the best family exhibiting a 24.8% higher rate. Four families had higher growth in all evaluated morphometric characteristics when compared to control group. Only one family did not differ in any of the evaluated characteristics with regard to the control group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23202/19599,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Digestible tryptophan levels for male broilers in pre-starter and starter diets,"The objective was to determine the digestible tryptophan requirements for male broilers in pre-starter and starter phases. Two experiments using 400 Cobb broilers were performed 200 males in the first experiment for the pre-starter phase (one to seven days old), and 200 males in the second experiment for the starter phase (eight to 21 days old). Chicks were housed in batter boxes made of galvanized steel as an experimental shed. The experiments were performed in a completely randomized design, with four treatments and five replicates, with ten birds each. In both experiments, the tryptophan requirement was determined using diets with different levels of digestible tryptophan. A tryptophan-deficient diet was formulated, as a basal diet, which was supplemented with increased levels of L-tryptophan in order to achieve the desirable digestible tryptophan levels. Treatments consisted of 0.209% (basal diet); 0.223%; 0.235% and 0.248% digestible tryptophan for the pre-starter phase (experiment 1) and 0.187% (basal diet); 0.200%, 0.211% and 0.223% digestible tryptophan for the starter phase (experiment 2). We evaluated feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion, as well as the metabolizability of feed nutrients. The performance and metabolic data were subjected to analysis of variance, and estimates of digestible tryptophan levels were made through polynomial regression models at 5% probability. There was no significant difference between the digestible tryptophan levels in the diet over performance and digestibility in both treatments. It is possible to conclude that the basal diet with 0.209% digestible tryptophan for the pre-starter phase and 0.187% for the starter phase, at a tryptophan: lysine ratio of 16%, as sufficient to meet the broilers requirements.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23289/19600,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Feeding behavior of sheep fed diets with Elaeis guineensis palm kernel meal,"In order to evaluate the feeding behavior of sheep fed with diets containing different levels of palm kernel meal (PKM) substituted for corn silage, a metabolic assay was performed on 20 ewes (5 treatments × 4 replicates) over 25 d. The animals received corn silage diets with the addition of increasing levels of PKM (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60%). The following parameters were evaluated: dry matter (DM) intake, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake, feeding time, rumination time, idle time, number of merycism mastications per bolus, time spent ruminating each bolus, DM and NDF per bolus, number of ruminated boluses per day, feeding and rumination efficiency, total chewing time, and number of merycism mastications per day. The daily intake of both DM and NDF increased linearly (P < 0.05), and when sheep were fed diets of at least 43.18 and 39.15% PKM, respectively, the consumption values were significantly different than when sheep were fed diets with 0% PKM (P < 0.05). In contrast, feeding time declined linearly, and in response to diets with at least 28.05% PKM, the sheep exhibited significantly different feeding times from those of sheep fed 0% PKM, with a reduction of 0.0613 percentage points per 1% increase in PKM. Idle time, rumination time, and rumination time per bolus each exhibited quadratic responses (P < 0.05), and the minimum rumination time per bolus was 44.37 s with 35.19% PKM. A quadratic response was also observed for total chewing time and both measures of merycism mastications (P < 0.05). Therefore, we concluded that the inclusion of PKM in the diets of sheep improves some parameters of feeding behavior, and the use of PKM is recommended at DM percentages of up to 40%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23189/19652,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Dry matter production and chemical composition of Massai grass submitted to nitrogen rates and cutting heights,"The study was carried out in a greenhouse with a 4X4 factorial arrangement randomized block design in order to evaluate the effects of nitrogen rates (0, 50, 100 and 150 mg dm-3) associated with cutting heights (10, 15, 20 and 25 cm) on dry matter production and the chemical composition of Massai grass. The seeding was done in pots with 11 kg of soil. 10 plants were kept per pot, and there were two cuts every 35 days. Nitrogen fertilization was split between the two cuts, where the first N application occurred after the uniformity cut and the second after the first cut. In each cut the plants were separated and weighed for botanical component evaluation: leaf blade and stem + sheath. After this, the samples were homogenized and analysed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) content. In the first cut, the N fertilization caused a linear increase in DM production of 0.058 g pot-1 per each 1 mg dm-3 of N applied, as well as causing an increase of 0.549% in CP percentage, a 0.0124 pot-1 g increase in CP production and a reduction of 0.055% in NDF. In the second cut, N rates promoted a quadratic effect on DM production. A maximum DM production of 16.48 g pot-1 with 107.27 mg dm-3 of N was observed while CP production content was increased by 0.0092 g pot-1 for each 1 mg dm-3 N applied. In terms of linear responses to DM and PB, as well as the use efficiency calculated for Massai grass, recommended N doses range between 50 and 100 g dm-3.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23072/19596,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic parameters for carcass traits and body size of meat sheep,"The present study aimed to estimate variance components and heritability coefficients (h2) in Santa Inês sheep by single- and two-trait analyses for the traits loin eye area (LEA), length (LEL) and maximum depth (LED), in the longissimus dorsi muscle, subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), fat thickness over the biceps femoris muscle (FTBF), croup height (CH), thoracic circumference (TC), thoracic depth (TD), body length (BL), and adult live weight (ALW). The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) was used to estimate variance components in an animal model. In both types of analyses, we estimated moderate heritability for all traits, with the exception of SFT, CH, TC, BL, and ALW (all of which yielded low h2 estimates). In two-trait analysis for body size, only TD yielded a lower h2 estimate, when compared to single-trait analysis. On the other hand, CH, TC, and BL yielded higher h2 estimates. Most estimates for variance components and h2 in two-trait analysis were higher than those in single-trait analysis. This finding suggests the possibility of a moderate response to selection for improvement in the carcass of meat sheep using the specific carcass traits evaluated (except SFT), highlighting LEA. The fat thickness over the biceps femoris muscle showed higher potential for response to direct selection for fat deposition than SFT. Thoracic depth showed higher potential for response to direct selection for body size than the other morphometric measurements. In the present study, adult live weight was not an effective criterion for direct selection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23056/19595,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Using swine farming wastewater for Signal grass cultivation,"The objective of this study was to evaluate forage production and root accumulation in Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk with swine wastewater as a fertilizer. The experiment was conducted into a greenhouse in Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Southeast of Minas Gerais, Rio Pomba Campus. Pots with 6 dm-3 volumes were used as experimental units. Were used a randomized block design with four replications. Were studied four swine waste doses (0, 225, 450 and 675mL pot-1) over four regrowth cycles. The dry matter production of the aerial part, forage accumulation rate, crude protein and dry matter production of roots increased with the highest swine waste doses being around 670, 742, 160 and 465% respectively from lower to higher dose. There was interaction between swine waste and regrowth cycles for plant height and tillering, and in all regrowth cycles responded positively with increasing swine waste doses. Applying swine waste on pastures is therefore a viable alternative to increase productivity of B. decumbens cv. Basilisk, it recommends the use of swine waste corresponding to the dose of 675mL pot-1 to maintenance pastures",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23319/19601,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Physical composition of carcass, commercial cuts and meat characteristics of young bulls fed millet-based diets containing increased crude glycerin levels","Assessment of carcass and meat characteristics of Nellore young bulls finished in feedlot with crude glycerin levels (0, 60, 120, and 240 g kg-1 dry matter) in millet-based diets. Twenty-eight young bulls with mean age of 18 months and average weight of 357 ± 23.56 kg were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments and seven replicates. It was observed that the physical composition and edible portion of the carcass were not affected by crude glycerin levels in the diets. However, the increased dietary crude glycerin level raised the weights of the forequarters (kg and % of cold carcass weight), but not that of the pistol cut and short ribs. Among the commercial cuts prepared to marketing of the pistol cut, only the weight of the rump cap (% cold carcass weight) was changed, decreasing linearly with increasing dietary crude glycerin levels. Additionally, meat characteristics remained unaltered by the increased levels of crude glycerin. It was concluded that inclusion of up to 240 g kg-1 of crude glycerin in millet grain-based diets for Nellore young bulls finished in feedlot does not alter the main carcass and meat characteristics or affect their economic value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22977/19594,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic variability of wild populations of Leporinus elongatus in the São Domingos River - MS Brazil: a preliminary view on the construction of the hydroelectric plant,"Most of the electricity used in Brazil comes from hydroelectric plants, mainly due to the great availability of its water resources. However, the construction of these plants denotes serious problems related to migration of native fish and the genetic conservation of stocks. Current study evaluates two wild population of Leporinus elongatus (piapara) located downstream (Population A - PopA) and upstream (Population B - PopB) of the Cachoeira Branca before the construction of the São Domingos hydroelectric plant (HPP) in the Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. Thirty samples from caudal fins were collected and analyzed for each population. Eighty-nine fragments, including 72 polymorphic ones (80.9%), were analyzed. Low fragments (less than 0.100) in both populations (PopA = 2 and PopB = 3) were identified. Nine fixed fragments (frequency 1.000) (PopA = 3 and PopB = 6), and four exclusive fragments (PopA = 3 and PopB = 1) were also reported. The genetic variability within populations, calculated by Shannon Index and by percentage of polymorphic fragments, indicated high rates of intrapopulation variability (PopA = 0.309 and 61.80% and PopB = 0.392 and 71.90%, respectively). Genetic distance and identity rates (0.089 and 0.915, respectively) were different between populations, whilst AMOVA showed that most variations lie within the populations and not between them. Fst and Nm rates showed moderate genetic differentiation with low numbers of migrants. Results reveal populations with high intra-population genetic variability and genetic differentiation, with low gene flow. The passage ladders of São Domingos HPP should control fish transposition to preserve genetic variability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22861/19591,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Digestible arginine concentrations in the diet of Japanese quails,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of arginine in the diet of Japanese quails and to determine which provides the best egg production indices. We used 400 birds with an initial average weight of 180 g at 140 days of age. These were distributed among experimental units in a randomized design. Five levels of digestible arginine were studied (1.148, 1.256, 1.364, 1.472, and 1.580%) in reference to a fixed level of digestible lysine (1.083%; for arginine to lysine ratios of 1.06, 1.16, 1.26, 1.36, and 1.46). Each treatment was replicated 10 times for a total of 50 experimental units, each with eight quails. Feed rations, leftovers, and dead animals were weighed to calculate and adjust performance parameters. The variables analyzed were: daily feed intake (DFI), egg laying rate (ER), average egg weight (EW), total egg mass (EM), feed conversion per egg mass and per dozen eggs (FCEM and FCDE), yolk, skin, and albumen weights (AYW, ASW and AAW), relative weights of yolk, albumen and shell (RYW, RAW and RSW), the Haugh unit (HU), and the percentage of eggs suitable for market (EP). The variables associated with performance and internal and external quality were not affected (P > 0.05) by different levels of arginine, except for EP, which decreased linearly (P = 0.009) with increasing arginine according to the equation: ? = -3.44x + 103.13, r² = 0.94. We conclude that the best concentration of arginine in quail diets is 1.148%, corresponding to an arginine to lysine ratio of 1.06.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22951/19593,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of including scrapes of residual dehydrated cassava in sheep feeding on intake and nutrient digestibility,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the inclusion of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% of scrapes residual dehydrated cassava (SRDC) in sheep feed on the intake and total digestibility coefficient (DC) of nutrients. We used four sheep with body weight (BW) of 26.0 kg, distributed in a Latin square design. The sheep were placed in metabolism cages and received two meals a day. The variables studied were subjected to analysis of variance and differences were tested using regression analysis at the 5% significance level. We determined that the inclusion of different concentrations of SRDC in sheep feeding did not modify (p > 0.05) the intake of intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), or total carbohydrates (TC) expressed in g animal-1 day-1, g kg0.75-1 and %BW). On average 2.83%, 2.58%, 0.34%, 0.07%, 1.62%, 0.91%, and 2.24% of the BW were obtained for intake of DM, OM, CP, EE, NDF, ADF, and TC, respectively. However, the four experimental diets negatively affected the NFC intake and %BW (p < 0.05). Different concentrations (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) of SRDC in sheep diets did not influence (p > 0.05) the digestibility coefficient of most of the variables measured (DM, OM CP, EE, NDF, ADF, TCH, NFC, with average values of 67.79%, 67.61%, 53.87%, 81.42%, 55.61%, 39.07%, 70.95%, and 91.48%, respectively. Thus, we conclude that the inclusion of up to 30% of SRDC in sheep diets would not affect intake or nutrient digestibility",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22798/19589,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Digestibility and performance of juvenile Nile tilapia fed with diets containing forage palm,"Supplying the nutritional needs of animals in an economical way is essential to the success of any type of production. The forage palm is a cactaceae well-adapted to semiarid regions and commonly used in the feeding of ruminants. However, studies assessing its use in fishes are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the digestibility of bran from five different forage palm cultivars (Opuntia fícus) in juvenile Nile tilapia and the development of juveniles when receiving increasing levels of the cultivar with the best apparent digestibility coefficient of crude protein (ADCCP) (75.2%). We used 90 masculinized juvenile Nile tilapia (with an average weight of 6.02 ± 0.65 g) in the digestibility experiment to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter (ADCDM), crude energy (ADCCP), and crude protein of the cultivars (Orelha de onça, Miúda, Gigante, Comum, and IPA 20). The experimental design was completely randomized (CRD) with five treatments and three repetitions. In the development experiment, 300 masculinized juvenile Nile tilapia (with average weight of 1.39 ± 0.12 g) received feed with different inclusion levels (0, 72, 144, and 216 g Kg-1) of IPA 20 palm bran in a CRD with four treatments and five repetitions. We observed significant differences (P < 0.05) for ADCDM and ADCCP between the treatments. The cultivars that presented the highest ADCDM were IPA 20 (41.75%), Orelha de onça (36.41%), and Gigante (32.59%). For ADCCP, the best cultivar was IPA 20 with 75.2%, followed by Orelha de onça (61.5%), and Miúda (56.1%). As for the performance, the inclusion of IPA 20 palm bran at a rate of 113 g/kg-1 provided the best values in terms of weight gain and final weight in juvenile Nile tilapia.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22834/19590,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Quail performance and egg quality at the end of production fed with varying levels of calcium,"The goal of the present study was to evaluate the influence of increasing levels of dietary calcium on performance, egg quality, and the amount of calcium retained in the meat and excreted by Japanese quails at the final production. Four hundred 46-58-week-old Japanese quails were distributed in a completely randomized design consisting of five calcium level treatments: T1 = 2.95%, T2 = 3.25%, T3 = 3.55%, T4 = 3.85% and T5 = 4.15% calcium. The performance variables included feed intake (g bird-1 day-1), egg production (%), feed conversion by egg mass and per dozen eggs, egg mass (g), and viability. For egg quality, we assessed egg weight, percentage of albumen, yolk weight, percentage of shell, and shell thickness. We also evaluated the amount of calcium present in the meat and the amount of calcium excreted by quails. Increasing levels of calcium linearly influenced feed conversion, weight of yolk, and percentage of eggshell. Shell thickness increased up to the 3.85% calcium treatment. Calcium content of the meat differed among the quails; the quails fed the lowest level of calcium (2.95%) showed higher calcium content in meat, whereas calcium excretion increased with increasing levels of calcium in the diet. In conclusion, the addition of 3.85% of calcium in quail feed at the end of production improved eggshell quality, and maintained internal quality and performance within the recommended standards for the production phase tested in quails. Levels higher than 3.85% calcium negatively influenced the parameters analyzed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22769/19649,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Effects of housing conditions and glutamine levels on growthperformance of post-weaning piglets,"This study aimed to determine the effects of housing conditions and glutamine (GLN) levels on growth performance and incidence of diarrhea in weaned piglets. Forty-eight piglets were randomly assigned (4x2 factorial design) to one of the eight experimental diets represented by four levels of dietary GLN (0.0, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 %) and two housing conditions (AD = adequate and INAD = inadequate). From 22 to 28 days of age all animals were challenged daily with Escherichia coli polysaccharides. No effect of GLN level was found on daily gain (ADG), daily feed intake (ADFI) or body weight at 28 days postweaning (BW28). For housing conditions, ADG at 21 days after weaning was greater for animals of treatment AD than INAD, and AD had lower body weight variation than INAD pigs at 21 days after weaning. Considering the whole period, AD had a higher ADG, ADFI and BW28 than INAD. However, an interaction effect was observed for feed:gain rate, in which values decreased linearly (Y = 2.1727 - 0.4017x; R2=0.92) just for AD pigs as GLN levels increased. No GLN level effects were observed for diarrhea incidence; however, AD had a higher number of animals without diarrhea and with lower incidence of severe diarrhea than INAD pigs. In conclusion, supplementing GLN doesn’t affect ADG, ADFI or BW28 but it improves feed efficiency when housing conditions are adequate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22758/19587,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Genetic characteristics of Tambaqui broodstocks in the state of Rondônia, Brazil: implications on production and conservation","In recent years, the genetic monitoring of broodstocks in fish farming has been greatly highlighted due to its importance in the management and improvement of their production and conservation. Current study evaluates the genetic diversity of four Tambaqui broodstocks (Colossoma macropomum) in the state of Rondônia (Brazil) and discusses activities towards the species´s correct production management and conservation. Nine primers were employed to analyze 94 specimens from four fish farms in the municipalities of Ji-Paraná (JP), Ouro Preto do Oeste (OP), Presidente Médici (PM) and Rolim de Moura (RM). Differences in the frequency of 38 fragments, with an exclusive fragment in JP and OP, were reported. High polymorphism (52.40 to 64.60%) and Shannon Index (0.313 to 0.382) rates were observed. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated that most variation is within each stock. The identity and genetic distance between the groups ranged between 0.927 and 0.954 and between 0.047 and 0.076 respectively, with shortest distance between the OPxPM and JPxRM groups. Genetic differentiation ranged from moderate to high (Fst = 0.081 to 0.179) and the number of migrants per generation was moderate (Nm = 3.83 to 6.24). As a rule, stocks showed high genetic variability and moderate / high differentiation and genetic distance between them. The results allowed direct conservation programs and increase the productivity of this species in fish farming through breeding programs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22718/19585,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic diversity of pacu and piapara broodstocks in restocking programs in the rivers Paraná and Paranapanema (Brazil),"The genetic diversity of Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu) and Leporinus elongatus (piapara) broodstocks used in restocking programs in the rivers Paraná and Paranapanema is analyzed. One hundred and twenty specimens (two broodstocks of each species) from fish ponds in Palotina PR Brazil and in Salto Grande SP Brazil were assessed. Ten primers produced 96 fragments, comprising 68 (70.83%) and 94 (97.92%) polymorphic fragments for P. mesopotamicus and L. elongatus broodstocks, respectively. Differences (p < 0.05) in the frequency of 15 and 27 fragments were detected for each species, without exclusive fragments. Shannon Index (0.347 - 0.572) and the percentage of polymorphic fragments (57.3% - 94.8%) revealed high intra-population genetic variability for all broodstocks. Results of molecular variance analyses (AMOVA) showed that most variations do not lie between the broodstocks but within each broodstock (89%). Genetic (0.088 and 0.142) and identity (0.916 and 0.868) distance rates demonstrated similarity between the broodstocks of each species, corroborated by Fst (0.1023 and 010.27) and Nm (4.18 and 4.33) rates, with a slight genetic difference due to genic flux. High intrapopulation genetic variability and similarity between the broodstocks of each species was also detected, proving a common ancestry.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22601/19584,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Qualitative feed restriction for late finishing pigs on meat quality and fatty acid profile,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of including cashew bagasse bran (CBB) as a food ingredient in qualitative feed restriction programs on the carcass traits and meat quality of barrows and gilts. Twenty–four crossbred pigs (12 barrows and 12 gilts) were used, with an average initial body weight of 57.93 ± 3.67 kg/LW. The experimental design was a randomized block 3x2 factorial arrangement with three levels (0%, 15% and 30% CBB), two sexes (barrows and gilts) and four repetitions. The treatments were composed of the basal diet (BD) formulated with corn, soybean meal and a commercial base mix for finishing pigs, to which different levels of CBB were added. At the end of the trial period, the animals were slaughtered for the evaluation of the meat quality and carcass traits. The inclusion of CBB in the diets did not affect the carcass traits of the gilts but affected the carcass traits of the barrow positively, increasing theyield of meat in the chilled carcass and reducing the thickness of subcutaneous fat. In the longissimus dorsi muscle and in the adipose tissue of the pigs, the myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic (C16:1), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), linolenic (C18:3) and arachidonic (C20:4) fatty acids were evaluated, and no effect was observed (P > 0.05) from the levels of CBB in the diets. In the comparisons between the sexes, a greater concentration of C20:4 fatty acid was observed in the carcass of the gilts. In this context, CBB was considered for use as a feed ingredient in programs of qualitative feed restriction for finishing pigs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22568/19582,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Agronomic, morphogenic and structural characteristics of Marandu grass in silvopastoral systems composed of babassu palm and grass monoculture","This study evaluated the agronomic, morphogenic and structural characteristics of palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha) in silvopastoral systems (SSP’s) composed of babassu palms (Attalea speciosa) and grass monoculture in the Pre-Amazon region of the state of Maranhão, Brazil. The study followed a completely randomized design, with the arrangement in split plots with six replicates for the evaluation of agronomic characteristics and 30 repetitions for the morphogenic and structural characteristics. The plots were divided into pasture environments with different palm densities (monoculture, 80, 131, 160 palms.ha-¹), and the subplots were divided into the different seasons (rainy and dry). Total forage production was affected (P < 0.05) by the interaction between palm density and season. The rainy season, compared to the dry season, presented higher total forage production, whereas among silvopastoral systems, the one with 80 palms.ha-¹ presented higher production. The same pattern was found for leaf production. In the rainy season the production of culms increased, as did the ratio leaf.culm-1. Regarding the accumulation of dead material, the only observed difference was a smaller accumulation in the dry season for pastures with 160 palms.ha-¹. In the rainy season, the leaf elongation rate, leaf appearance rate, and final leaf length had higher values in the silvopastoral system with 131 palm.ha-¹, whereas during the dry season, these variables only differed in the monoculture system. Tiller elongation rate and the phyllochron were not affected (P > 0.05) by pastoral system during the rainy season, but in the dry period, higher responses were obtained in SSPs. Overall, SSPs with 80 palms.ha-¹ favored the agronomic characteristics of pastures. Morphogenic and structural characteristics were favored by increasing palm densities. Leaf senescence and duration were not affected by the system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22543/19581,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Feeding behavior of dairy cows fed different levels of castor meal in the diet,"This study aimed to evaluate the inclusion of castor meal in the diet of lactating cows in grazing system and its implications in feeding behavior. Eight Holstein x Zebu crossbred cows, with average milk production adjusted to 300 days in the previous lactation, between 5000 and 6000 kg and 100.33 ± 13.33 days of lactation and average body weight of 509.47 ± 61.90 kg, were distributed in two 4 x 4 Latin squares, with 4 levels of castor meal inclusion in the total diet, and using Brachiaria brizantha pasture as roughage. The experiment consisted of four experimental periods, lasting 21 days each. In each trial, the roughage and supplements were collected for evaluation of chemical composition. Animals were subjected to visual observation for evaluation of feeding behavior for 24 hours, from the 20th to the 21st day of each experimental period. The observations of the activities were recorded every five minutes. We determined the number of ruminating chews and the time spent in rumination of each ruminal bolus with the use of digital stopwatch. There was a quadratic effect for the grazing time with maximum point of inclusion of castor meal at 4.61% in the diet; other variables did not differ: rumination, idleness, trough, rumination efficiency, feeding and grazing time, rumination and idleness. Castor meal can be included in the diet with levels up to 10%, for little changes in the feeding behavior of animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22584/19583,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Fatty acid profile in meat of culling ewes in different feedlot periods fed diets containing levels of inclusion of linseed,"Linseed plays an important role in animal nutrition as it contains long-chain fatty acids in its composition, which, once absorbed, are incorporated into meat and milk. For evaluate the concentration of fatty acids in the Longissimus dorsi muscle of culling ewes fed diets containing levels of inclusion of linseed, 88 culling ewes were used with an average initial body weight of 37.65 ± 6.98 kg were distributed in a completely randomized design with 12 treatments. Treatments consisted of the interaction between levels of linseed (0, 5, 10, and 15%) and days in feedlot (30, 45, and 60). The most present fatty acids in the composition of the muscle L. dorsi were palmitic (27.32 g 100 g-1) and stearic (17.77 g 100 g-1). Saturated acids remained at low levels as the animals were fed greater levels of linseed, demonstrating the importance of introducing quality foods in animal feeding. Oleic acid was the most present monounsaturated fatty acid, with 40 g 100 g-1. Palmitoleic and elaidic fatty acids increased linearly as the linseed inclusion in the diet was increased. Polyunsaturated acids increased with the presence of linseed in the diet. For the linolenic acid (C18: 3n3), the best result was with inclusion of 10% of linseed in the total diet. All groups of animals that received linseed obtained better n6:n3 ratios, which varied from 1.81 to 4.14. The higher CLA values obtained in this study are related to the higher amounts of inclusion of linseed in the sheep diet, varying from 1.15 to 5.72 g 100 g-1. It is recommended culling ewes supplemented with inclusion of 10% linseed, for 60 days in feedlot, because they comprise a larger number of favorable traits regarding to the profile fatty acids of Longissimus dorsi.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22538/19648,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Herbage allowance effects on the characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu pastures and the production and economic viability of Nellore heifers,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three herbage allowances (5, 10, and 15 kg dry matter [DM] 100-1 of body weight [BW]) for Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu pastures in a continuous grazing system on the morphological and nutritional characteristics of forage, animal performance, and economic viability in Nellore heifers. The total experimental area was 60 ha, divided into 12 paddocks of 5 ha each, with 4 paddocks per treatment. The experimental animals were Nellore heifers (260 in total), with average BW of 301.16 ± 9.12 kg, receiving 0.4 % BW in multiple supplements. We evaluated the production, structural characteristics, and nutritional value of the forage, productive performance, carcass characteristics, and economic viability of each allowance. There were significant effects for the production, st uctural characteristics, and nutritional value of the forage treatment. The proportions of leaves were 42.40, 38.20, and 30.88 % and the leaf:stem ratios were 1.22, 1.03, and 0.83 for the 5, 10, and 15 kg DM 100-1 BW herbage allowances, respectively. The average daily weight gain (mean 0.42, 0.75, and 0.63 kg daily-1) and stocking rate (3.35, 1.87, and 1.26 animal unit ha-1) had a significant effect for the 5, 10, and 15 kg DM 100-1 BW forage allowance, respectively. The herbage allowances were evaluated as being economically viable with a profit margin of 10.37, 23.65, and 14.43 % for the 5, 10, and 15 kg DM 100-1 BW allowances, respectively. The greatest pasture response was found in the 5 kg DM 100-1 BW allowance and was related to better nutritional values and morphological characteristics of the pasture and greater stoking rate and weight gain per area.

1,1978,Economic feasibility of adding sunflower oil to elephant grass-based diets of lactating dairy cows,"We aimed to evaluate the economic feasibility of adding increasing levels of sunflower oil (0.0, 15, 30, and 45 g/kg of dry matter) to elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum, Schum) based diets of milkproducing Holstein cows. Data were obtained and analyzed for 12 primiparous Holstein cows that produced on average 16.5 ± 2.8 kg of milk/day, at 95 ± 25 days of lactation. Cows were distributed by milk production, order of lactation, and body weight in a 4 × 4 triple Latin square. Isoproteic diets were provided ad libitum in the form of a forage:concentrate ratio of 60:40, on a dry matter basis. Daily milk production was recorded and milk was analyzed for fat, protein, and fatty acids contents. An economic feasibility study was performed considering the price of the supplied ingredients and the daily intake of each diet. The economic benefit was derived by the determining the difference between income from the sale of milk and the cost of animal feed. The quality-based payment was estimated by averaging the systems used by eight dairy companies, based on fat and protein contents and milk volume. The sunflower oil-free diet provided the greatest economic benefit. Adding sunflower oil to elephant grassbased diets was not economically viable because of its associated costs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22492/19579,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Plants that cause photosensitivity in ruminants in Brazil,"This study aimed to review the mechanisms of action, clinical signs, pathology, and toxic compounds of plants that cause photosensitivity in ruminants. In addition, we sought to clarify the diagnostic methods and prophylaxis of photosensitivity-induced plants. Photosensitizing plants constitute an important group of poisonous plants in Brazil and there are at least seventeen species distributed in nine genera. Some of these plants have well known toxic compounds; in others, the substance responsible for the disease is unknown. In general, the photosensitivity can be classified as primary or secondary. Among the plants causing primary photosensitivity in Brazil, Ammi majus contains furocoumarins, while the compound in Froelichia humboldtiana remains uncertain. The known toxic compounds causing secondary photosensitivity include pyrrolizidine alkaloids, furans sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, and steroidal saponins. In other plants causing secondary photosensitization, including Stryphnodendron spp. and Enterolobium spp., the toxic compound is still unknown. Future research should be conducted in order to determine the various mechanisms of action of each toxic compound to assist the diagnosis of photosensitivity, to develop less toxic or non-toxic cultivars, or even to find new ways of preventing photosensitization.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22386/19446,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Isolation of dermatophytes from 50 asymptomatic domestic cats treated at the Federal University of Mato Grosso Veterinary – Hospital in Cuiabá, MT","Dermatophytosis, commonly known as ringworm, is a zoonotic disease caused by complex fungi that grow as hyphae and attach to the skin, hair and nails or claws. About 40 species of fungi of the genera Microsporum spp., Trichophyton spp. and Epidermophyton spp. are considered dermatophytes, and Microsporum canis is the genus most commonly isolated from cats. This study investigated the occurrence of dermatophytes in cats without clinical signs of skin diseases. The study involved the physical examination of 50 clinically healthy cats and the collection of samples for direct examination and fungal culture at a university veterinary hospital. The resulting data were evaluated by the chi-square association test. Of the 50 cats, 11 (22%) presented dermatophytes, with a predominance of Microsporum spp. The other 39 animals were diagnosed for non-dermatophytic fungi. Sex, breed and the presence of contactants showed no statistical difference, although there was a predominance of adult animals. The high dermatophyte infection rate confirms that cats without clinical signs can harbor these fungi, acting as asymptomatic carriers, contaminating the environment and increasing the infection rate. This study confirms that cats without clinical signs can be carriers of ringworm, which underscores the importance of the adoption of control methods even for clinically healthy animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21824/19445,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Guaiaca – a software tool for supporting the use of scientific applications designed for data analysis – part I: execution assistant,"The aim of this work is to develop a software tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface of generic and configurable design in order to ease the researcher’s tasks in data manipulation and analysis. Two primary targets have influenced the design: data preparation for analysis in animal breeding programs and usability increase for those applications that perform important analysis methods, but interact with users only through text files and command lines. The Guaiaca tool was designed as a “utility belt” in the form of two integrated assistants, and it can be combined with multiple analysis applications. This tool offers facilities to: (a) collect, manipulate, and reorganize data; (b) organize, register, and retrieve analyses through descriptors; and (c) prepare and activate analysis processes. Guaiaca’s Execution Assistant module is described in this paper, where is also emphasized the parameters to configure, the main data structures to maintain, and the form of the relationship between its generic interface and combined analysis applications. The generic interface has been customized and validated for the peculiarities of two applications, WOMBAT (mixed models) and INTERGEN (Bayesian models). Several data analyses were performed with the interface support to prove its generality and ease of installation, configuration and operation. Data sets from 5,726 quails in a breeding program were used with these applications. Use of the integrated Guaiaca-WOMBAT application is illustrated with an analysis example, prepared and visualized on the Guaiaca tool and executed by WOMBAT. The Beta version of the Guaiaca tool for Windows is available free of charge to the scientific community and can be obtained at http://www.ufpel.edu.br/~gil.medeiros/guaiaca.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21878/19467,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Anti-nutritional potential of protodioscin and kinetics of degradation in Urochloa grasses,"This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional value of Urochloa exotic grasses to quantify aspects of anti-quality and to identify their correlation with quality grasses. We evaluated the grasses U. humidicola cv. Comum, U. humidicola cv. BRS Tupi, U. decumbens cv. Basilisk, D70 U. decumbens and U. ruziziensis ecotype R124, and we grouped them into summer, autumn, winter and spring. We determined the chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, levels of protodioscin and cumulative gas production from the leaves of grass materials in nature. Basilisk and D70 showed higher content protodioscin in all seasons, with the highest values (31.4 and 27.4 g kg-1, respectively) in spring. D70 had a crude protein content of 140.0 g kg-1 in summer and a better in vitro digestibility of dry matter (888.7 g kg-1). R124 had a higher cumulative gas production in the spring (16.44 mL gas 100 mg DM-1). U. humidicola (Comum and BRS Tupi) presented lower protodioscin concentrations (1.22 and 1.07 g kg DM-1, respectively), and U. decumbens (Basilisk and D70) presented higher concentrations (27.25 and 24.55 g kg DM-1, respectively).

1,1978,"Effect of agaricus blazei in the diet of broiler chickens on immunity, serum parameters and antioxidant activity","The effect of adding Agaricus blazei to the diet of broilers on immunity, serum parameters, and antioxidant activity was evaluated. A total of 840 1-day-old chicks were used, distributed among five levels of a completely randomized design (0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20% A. blazei), with six replications and 28 birds per experimental unit. The weights of the thymus, spleen and cloacal bursa were not influenced (P > 0.05). Leukocytes, macrophages and nitric oxide were unaffected (P > 0.05), but at each supplementation level compared with the control, differences appeared in the percentages of eosinophils and macrophages (P < 0.05) at inclusion levels of 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20%. At 28 days, the antibody titer against Newcastle disease showed a quadratic response (P < 0.05) with supplementation, and from the estimated level of 0.08% the production of antibodies was stimulated; however, the same behavior was not observed (P > 0.05) at 42 days. Hypocholesterolemic effect was demonstrated (P < 0.05), but the serum triglyceride concentration was not affected (P > 0.05). The antioxidant activity of mushroom showed a positive linear effect (P < 0.05) on DPPH capture on day zero of meat cooling. The inclusion of A. blazei in the diet of broilers provided an immunostimulatory activity and hypocholesterolemic effect. Residual compounds with antioxidant activity were present in the meat, which may promote tissue protection of the animal in vivo, making possible the use of A. blazei as a natural additive.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22447/19480,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effect of ozonation on the Staphylococcus Aureus innoculated in milk,"The aim of this research was evaluate the efficiency of the action of ozonation of milk on the reduction of the bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus artificially inoculated and subjected to different binomials times/concentrations of ozone. The samples were divided in four assays: 1 and 2, with skim milk and ozone concentrations of 34.7 mg L –1 and 44.8 mg L-1, respectively, and assays 3 and 4, with whole milk and the same concentrations of ozone. The time of ozonation in all of the assays was 5 (T1), 10 (T2), 15 (T3), 20 (T4) and 25 (T5) minutes. Each treatment was replicated three times. The bacterial counts were determined immediately before and after the ozonation process by plating the samples on Baird Parker agar. In treatments 1 and 2, the greatest reductions were 0.42 log10 CFU/mL (colony forming units per millilitre), whereas in treatments 3 and 4, the greatest reductions were 0.19 and 0.21 log10 CFU/mL, respectively. The results of all of the tests show that, for T1, there was no reduction in the microbial load, whereas for T2, there was a sharp decrease in the microbiota, and this decrease was even more significant for T4 and T5. In both skim and whole milk with ozone concentrations of 34.7 and 44.8 mg L-1, the reductions were significantly greater after 20 minutes of ozonation. The results indicated that ozone showed low efficacy in the reduction of S.aureus inoculated into fluid milk and milk fat interferes with the bactericidal action of the gas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21805/19637,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro efficacy of teat antiseptics against Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from bovine mastitis,"The process of teat disinfection is a widely accepted component of successful mastitis control programs by reducing the number of bacteria on the teat skin and healing teat lesions. For contagious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, post-milking teat disinfection remains a simple, effective and economical practice for prevention of new intramammary infections (IMIs) of lactating dairy cows. Despite the universal acceptance of teat dipping as a method of mastitis control, variations in the susceptibility and resistance profile of mastitis pathogens among antiseptics have been described. Thus, here we sought to explore the in vitro efficacy of the followings antiseptics against S. aureus isolated from IMIs: chlorhexidine (2.0%), chlorine (2.5%), quarternary ammonium (4.0%), lactic acid (2.0%) and iodine (0.6%). We used 50 S. aureus strains isolated from bovine IMIs from 50 dairy herds located at Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul States (Brazil). The antiseptics were evaluated at four different specific intervals (15, 30, 60 and 300 s). We found a higher activity for quarternary ammonium and chlorhexidine against S. aureus at all time-points, followed by iodine and then chlorine. Lactic acid treatment produced the worst results for all time-points and strains. Due to variations in the sensitivity and resistance profile of antiseptics against S. aureus isolated from IMIs, the effectiveness of the antiseptics against the major mastitis pathogens should be periodically evaluated in dairy farms in an attempt to reduce the rate of new IMIs in the herd.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21597/19639,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Sixteen mongrel sheep with an average weight of 33 ± 6.04 kg were randomly distributed between four treatments. Data were tested for assumptions of normality, subjected to an analysis of variance, and adjusted in regression equations and by Williams’ test, to estimate the W point. The voluntary intake of dry matter (DM) and insoluble neutral detergent fiber (NDF) decreased linearly (P = 0.013 and P = 0.002) by 5.0 g and 2.41 g d-1, respectively, for every 1% of NC added to the diet. The time the animals spent feeding (288.75 min d-1) was not significantly affected; time spent idle increased linearly (P= 0.0002) by 3.10 min, and time spent during rumination decreased linearly by 2.62 min (P = 0.001) for each 1% addition of the co-product. The number of ruminated boluses (NRB) displayed a decreasing effect (P = 0.004) of 4.61 d-1 for each 1% of NC. For ruminating chews, the time spent per bolus (37.5 sec) and the number per bolus (56.14) did not differ (P > 0.05) between treatments. However, the total chewing time (TCT) decreased linearly (P = 0.002) by 0.05 h d-1 and the number of chews per day displayed a quadratic effect (P = 0.008), with a maximum value estimated at 17.5% of NC in the diet. Rumination efficiency did not differ between the treatments (101.95 g DM h-1 and 36.76 g NDF h-1). The feeding efficiency (FE) had a linear reduction (P = 0.045) of 0.42 g NDF h-1, but was similar for g DM h-1 (172.5). The daily intake of DM and NDF showed W points estimated at 51.96% and 30.67% NC, respectively. The variables NRB, TCT, and FE (g NDF h-1) had W points estimated at 56.64%, 56.19%, and 56.33% NC, respectively. The Brazil nut cake, when present at levels greater than 56% of the diet’s DM, affects the ingestive behavior of the animals, particularly rumination-related variables, and at levels of 30.67%, it begins to affect the consumption of NDF, primarily due to the ether extract content and the diet’s fiber source.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22474/19466,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,"The quality of lipid ingredients for pig diets: effects on performance, carcass and meat traits and adipocyte diameter","This study aimed to evaluate the viability of using four lipid products (refined soybean oil, RO; degummed soybean oil, DO; pig lard, PL; and recycled frying oil, FO) as ingredients for pig feed during the finishing phase. The products were previously evaluated for the presence of insoluble impurities, peroxide levels, and total acidity as well as dioxin group, polychlorinated biphenyl, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants. Eighty 110 day-old pigs, including 40 castrated males and 40 females, with a mean initial weight of 59.01 ± 5.09 kg, were subjected to four treatments (feed containing RO, DO, PL, and FO) for 32 days to evaluate the effect on growth performance, carcass and meat traits and adipocyte diameter. The results for the products did not reveal any degradation or presence of contaminants within the use restriction levels. There were no differences regarding performance, carcass and meat traits, and adipocyte diameter among the treatments. The animals fed FO feed exhibited a poorer loin area and marbling (P < 0.07).

1,1978,Microencapsulated acids associated with essential oils and acid salts for piglets in the nursery phase,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of commercial blends of organic and inorganic acids combined with essential oils for piglets in the nursery phase. The formulations were administered as microcapsules or as acid salts. Ninety-six, Pen Ar Lan, barrow and female piglets, weaned at a body weight of 600 kg ± 12 kg and age of 23 days were subjected to four treatments. The animals were distributed in randomized blocks of three animals per pen and 8 replicates per treatment. The treatments consisted of four different diets: control (free of organic acids); acid and essential oil blends (fumaric acid 10,5%, malic acid 8.0%, essential oils; in microencapsulated form); microencapsulated acid blend (phosphoric acid 10%, citric acid 10%, malic acid 10%, fumaric acid 20%; in microencapsulated form); and acid salt blend (formic acid 40.5%, phosphoric acid 13.6%, propionic acid 4.9% and salts (23.2% calcium and 4.4% phosphorus available). The performance parameters, digestive transit time, weights of organs of the digestive tract, bacterial count of feces (Lactobacillus, E coli and Salmonella ssp and Clostridium), pH of the stomach and duodenal content did not differ between treatment groups (P > 005). All treatments containing organic acids exhibited positive effects on diarrhea control (P < 005). The cecal contents of volatile fatty acids (VFA) were higher in piglets fed diets containing acids than in animals that received the control diet (P < 005), and blends containing essential oils improved the jejunum villus height compared with the control group. The use of diets containing acids improved diarrhea control and VFA production in the cecum, and specifically the diets containing microencapsulated acid blends required the lowest doses to be effective.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22395/19461,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Performance and intestinal health of weanling pigs fed with dietary nucleotides,"Previous studies reported benefits to growth performance, intestinal histology and reduced diarrhea for pigs supplemented with nucleotide additive as a replacement to antimicrobial growth promoters. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nucleotide levels on performance, occurrence of diarrhea, relative weight of organs, intestinal histology, and intestinal microbiota of weanling pigs. One hundred and sixty 21-d weaned pigs (6.43 ± 0.71 kg BW) were used in a randomized complete block design experiment with five treatments, eight replications per treatment and four animals per pen (experimental unit). The treatments were basal diet with 120 ppm of chloro-hydroxyquinoline (antimicrobial), and basal diet with 0 (control), 100, 150, or 200 ppm of nucleotides. The average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), gain to feed ratio (G:F), and occurrence of diarrhea were calculated from day 1 to 14, day 14 to 34, and day 1 to 34 of the experiment. A day after the end of the experiment, one animal from each pen was slaughtered to evaluate the relative weight of organs, intestinal histology, and intestinal microbiota. From day 1-14 and day 14-34 of the experiment, performance was not affected by the treatments. For the total experimental period (day 1-34), increasing the dietary concentrations of nucleotides linearly improved the final body weight and average daily gain. Salmonella spp. was detected only in the control treatment, without affecting the other microorganisms. Pigs fed with antibiotic had a lower occurrence of diarrhea from day 1-14 compared to pigs fed with nucleotide treatments. Although increasing the occurrence of diarrhea in the first 14 days, dietary nucleotides added up to 200 ppm, improve the final body weight and average daily gain at 34 days post weaning. Nucleotides and antimicrobial not shown beneficial effects on organ weights, and intestinal histology of nursery pig, however, are able to decrease the population of Salmonella spp. at small intestine.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22358/19642,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Tissue composition and allometric growth of tissues from commercial cuts and carcass of Texel lambs slaughtered with different weights,"In this study, we evaluated the tissue composition, the ratios between different issues, and the allometric growth of tissues from the commercial cuts neck, shoulder, rib, and leg, and of the carcass of Texel lambs. Thirty uncastrated male lambs born from single calvings were used in this experiment. Lambs were weaned, confined individually, and distributed into five treatments with six replications. Each treatment consisted of a predefined slaughter weight (T23 – initial slaughter, T25, T30, T35, and T40). The proportion of bone decreased linearly in the shoulder, rib, and legs, but remained constant in the neck. The proportion of muscle decreased in the rib, whereas in the other cuts it remained constant. The percentage of fat increased as the slaughter weight of the lambs was increased, for all cuts. In all cuts and in the carcass, bone and muscle showed early growth (b < 1), whereas fat displayed late growth (b > 1). The proportion of bone decreased and fat increased linearly in the carcass, and the proportion of muscle was not influenced by the slaughter weight of the lambs. The muscle/fat ratio decreased in all cuts, and consequently in the half-carcass, as the slaughter weight was increased. The muscle/ bone ratio increased in the shoulder, rib, leg, and half-carcass, but there was no significant effect on the neck. The bone and muscle tissues showed early growth, whereas the fat had late growth in the different commercial cuts and carcass of Texel lambs. The tissue growth pattern of the shoulder may be representative of the allometric growth of the different carcass tissues. An increase in the slaughter weight of Texel lambs leads to a reduction of the muscle/fat ratio, due to the higher deposition of fat in the carcass of these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21415/19455,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Cryopreservation of tambaqui semen using a dry shipper and a programmed freezing machine,"Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is a native freshwater fish that is of great importance for Brazilian aquaculture. Because of this importance, several techniques have been developed to improve the reproduction of this species in captivity. One of these techniques is the cryopreservation of sperm. In an effort to increase the efficiency of cryopreservation protocols, researchers have tried to determine suitable diluting solutions and freezing methods, which will provide a better post-thaw sperm quality. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of different diluents and freezing methods for the cryopreservation of tambaqui (C. macropomum) sperm. Samples of fresh semen were diluted in different treatments (Glucose 5% + 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide – DMSO, Glucose 5% + 10% Methyl glycol – MG, BTS + 10% DMSO and BTS + 10% MG) at a 1:9 dilution rate and frozen in a programmed freezing machine and a dry shipper. The semen samples were thawed and evaluated for vitality, sperm morphology and kinetics. Cryopreserved semen with DMSO and using the programmed freezing machine provided a greater percentage of motile sperm (15.44 ± 1.04%) after thawing compared to the dry shipper (3.99 ± 0.55%), regardless of the diluent. Additionally, DMSO showed better sperm velocities than MG regardless of the freezing method and the extender employed. A higher percentage of living spermatozoa was observed when glucose (37.28 ± 1.32%) (regardless of the freezing method and cryoprotectant) and DMSO (37.98 ± 1.25%) was used in the programmed freezing machine. For morphology, a greater amount of normal spermatozoa (46.10 ± 1.82%) was observed when the semen was cryopreserved using a freezing machine programmed with DMSO as the cryoprotectant and Glucose or BTS (38.16 ± 1.9% and 39.26 ± 1.87%, respectively) as extenders. Therefore, we suggest the use of the DMSO (10%) cryoprotectant in association with the Glucose (5%) extended in the programmed freezing machine for cryopreservation of C. macropomum semen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21997/19459,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis and ingestive behavior of lambs fed diets containing cottonseed cake in substitution of soybean meal","The cottonseed cake is a co-product obtained after extraction of oil cottonseed, and because of their bromatological characteristics has potential use in ruminant feed, can increase the economy efficiency of animal production systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate diets with cottonseed cake in substitution of soybean meal through nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis and the ingestive behavior of lambs. Forty crossbred Santa Inês × Dorper non-castrated rams with average initial weight of 20.9 ± 2.5 kg were distributed into a completely randomized design with four treatments and ten replicates, and fed diets containing cottonseed cake in substitution of 0, 33, 66 and 100% of soybean meal. The diets were composed of corn, soybean meal, cottonseed meal and hay, with forage:concentrate reason of 50:50, isonitrogenous, with 14% crude protein. The animals were confined individually in pens with slatted floor, the evaluations of ingestive behavior, which included observations of the feeding, rumination and idle times were performed in a period of 24 hours, in 5-minute intervals. At 97 days of experiment, a spot urine sample was collected from all animals to quantify the concentrations of nitrogen, creatinine, allantoin, uric acid, xanthine and hypoxanthine in the urine. The data were subjected to variance analysis and regression, adopting ?= 0.05. There was no significant difference between treatments for nitrogen balance, the synthesis of nitrogen compounds, and microbial efficiency. In addition, there was no effect of replacing soybean meal by cottonseed meal on feeding behavior of animals. Cottonseed cake can replace soybean meal up to 100% in diets for lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21787/19458,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Seasonal milk contamination by aflatoxin m1, organophosphates and carbamates in Paraná – Brazil","Aiming to evaluate the milk contamination in the dairy production systems (DPS) for mycotoxins and chemical residues of organophosphates and carbamates it was made a study encompassing 96 DPS in three regions of Parana state. There were collected samples of milk, water and food and they were evaluated for chemical residues in all samples and aflatoxin only for food and milk. Mycotoxins in food (aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2, zearalenone and ochratoxin) were detected by the method of thin layer chromatography – TLC and for the determination of aflatoxin M1 was used an immunoassay kit competitive ELISA Ridascreen®. The residues of organophosphates and carbamates were performed by colorimetric method qualitatively. There were evaluated the differences between regions, periods and the sources of mycotoxin contamination. Carbamates and organophosphates were screened for their presence in milk and the sources of food and water. Then it was estimated the contributions of each mycotoxin for milk contamination, as well as their respective contaminated food. Differences were found between periods (p < 0,05) for milk contamination with aflatoxin M1 – AFM1. For carbamates and organophosphates were found different contamination sources (p < 0,01). For the carbamates the source were pesticides used to parasitic herd control and for the organophosphates pesticides used in agriculture. For food sources contamination resulting in the AFM1 contamination it was detected that aflatoxin B1 – AFB1 was the main source. The aflatoxin G1 – AFG1 showed a strong correlation (p < 0,01) with AFB1 levels suggesting causal relationship is a function of fungal strains producing both at the same time. It was also found the prevalence of aflatoxin contamination in 70% of contaminated samples and its predominant presence in relation to other mycotoxins in all kinds of foods analyzed. By identifying the checkpoints of contamination can be proposed the inclusion of practical management methods to avoid this.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21652/19641,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Performance, nutrient digestibility, and quantitative carcass traits of lambs fed sunflower seeds and vitamin E","The aim of this study was to evaluate performance, nutrient digestibility, and carcass quantitative traits of lambs fed diets with and without sunflower seeds and vitamin E. Thirty-two uncastrated lambs at approximately 60 days of age, with 15 ± 0.2 kg, were housed in individual stalls and slaughtered at 32.0 ± 0.2 kg body weight. Treatments consisted of the following four diets: C = sugarcane + concentrate; CS = sugarcane + concentrate with sunflower seeds; CE = sugarcane + concentrate with 1,000 mg vitamin E kg-1 diet dry matter (DM); and CSE = sugarcane + concentrate with sunflower seeds and 1,000 mg vitamin E kg-1 diet DM. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (with and without sunflower seeds and with or without vitamin E, on the diet DM basis), and means were compared by Tukey’s test at 5% significance level. Consumption of vitamin E intake by the lambs provided (P < 0.05) the highest ether extract intake (20.91 g day-1) and consequently the highest (P < 0.05) digestibility of this nutrient (85.34%); however, it reduced (P < 0.05) the intakes of total carbohydrates (394.81 g day-1) and non-fibrous carbohydrates (242.47 g day-1) as a direct consequence of the diet composition. Inclusion of sunflower seeds and vitamin E in the lamb diets did not influence (P > 0.05) carcass morphological or quantitative measurements. Sunflower seeds and vitamin E showed to be satisfactory alternatives for inclusion in the concentrate for feedlot lambs, providing good performance and quality carcasses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21549/19478,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Morphogenetic and structural characteristics of clones of elephant grass managed under intermittent stocking,"This work was carried out to evaluate the morphogenetic and structural characteristics of basal and aerial tillers of two dwarf elephant grass clones (BRS Kurumi and CNPGL 00-1-3) managed under intermittent stocking in six grazing cycles. A completely randomized experimental design with three replications (paddocks) in split-split-plot arrangements was used. The clones were allocated to the plots, tiller classes were assigned to the subplots and grazing cycles to sub subplots. Higher values for basal tillers than aerial tillers were seen for the following characteristics: leaf elongation rate (12.8 and 5.1 cm/tiller/day), leaf appearance rate (0.26 and 0.19 leaves/tiller/day), stem elongation rate (0.38 and 0.16 cm/tiller/day), senescence rate (0.98 and 0.47 cm/tiller/day), total number of leaves (9.3 and 7.1 leaves/ tiller), number of live leaves (7.7 and 5.8 leaves/tiller) and final length of leaf blades (33.5 and 20.0 cm). Phyllochron was lower for basal (4.0 days/leaf) than aerial tillers (5.5 days/leaf). The leaf life span increased with the advance of the grazing cycles, averaging 31.2 days. The tiller density increased with the advance of the grazing cycles showing an average increase of 167% of aerial tillers and 62% of basal tillers for both clones. The morphogenetic and structural characteristics of dwarf clones were influenced jointly by the clones and the availability of the environmental factors of growth during the spring and summer. The high leaf elongation rates, associated with high leaf appearance rate, reveal the potential of high production dry matter of leaves and restoration of leaf area after grazing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19458/19453,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effects of the feeding system and breed on the growth performance, biometric features, and ruminal development of feedlot goat kids","The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of 2 feeding systems and 5 breeding groups on the growth performance, biometric features, and stomach morphology of feedlot goat kids. The experiment utilized gender as a randomized blocking factor in a 5 × 2 factorial scheme. The study goats were from the Alpine, Anglo-Nubian, 1/2 Boer x Alpine, 3/4 Boer x Alpine, and 7/8 Boer x Alpine breeds. Half of the goats were fed an experimental diet, whereas the other half were given the same diet supplemented with 1.5 L milk daily. The kids were slaughtered after they attained 30 kg body weight. The 1/2 Boer x Alpine goats showed superior growth performance because they exhibiting considerable heterosis. These animals are especially easy to use given that there is no need to maintain cross-bred females (½ Boer x Alpine e ¾ Boer x Alpine) in the flock. Using milk in the feed the animals does not adversely affect growth performance or biometric features. Moreover, it helps to reduce the total weight of the stomach and leads to a 51.39% savings on feed. Dietary supplementation of milk in goat feed is recommended so long as there is excess milk available on the property.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21299/19454,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mombasa grass characterisation at different heights of grazing in an intercropping system with Babassu and monoculture,"The aim of this study was to evaluate agronomic and structural traits, as well as root mass, of Panicum maximum cv. Mombasa in different conditions of animal grazing in the same pasture in a monoculture system and a Pasture-Forestry Intercropping System (intercropped with Babassu palm trees). Evaluations were performed from December 2012 to February 2013. The systems were kept under continuous grazing with sheep (20 kg live weight on average) throughout the evaluation period. The design was completely randomised into split plots, in which each plot was the system and the subplots were grazing heights, with three sample cycles. The Babassu palm tree influenced the production of the aerial-part dry matter in the intercropping system due to a decrease in grass tillering caused by shading stress. The root dry matter decreased influenced by shading and intensity of animal grazing in the evaluated heights, leading to a reduction as decreased the grass height. The monoculture system led to better results for the same heights in all parameters in comparison to the intercropping system, including the number of tillers, dry matter production (DM), leaf-area index (LAI) and DM (%), which were higher in the monoculture system regardless of the assessed heights. The natural shade of Babassu palms negatively affected the productive and structural traits of Panicum maximum cv. Mombasa, thereby altering the grass structure and lowering its productive capacity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19132/19452,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Tifton 85 grass responses to different nitrogen levels and cutting intervals,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of five levels of N and two regrowth intervals on the structural, productive, and nutritional characteristics of Tifton 85 grass (Cynodon spp). The experiment was conducted in a hay production field at the State University of West Paraná, planted in 2004 with Cynodon spp. cv. Tifton 85. The experiment was established in a randomized block design with factorial treatments of five N fertilization amounts (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha-1 cut-1) applied as urea after each cut, and two regrowth intervals (28 and 35 d), with four replicates. N application promoted changes in plant structure, such as increased canopy height, stem length, leaf elongation rate, and dry mass (DM) production. The greatest N use efficiency, considering the four harvests, occurred in the plot with 25 kg N ha-1 cut-1 at the 35-d interval, with a production of 13.79 kg DM kg-1 of N applied. A nutritional analysis indicated that 100 kg ha-1 of N cut-1 promoted higher crude protein (CP) at 28 d, with the highest concentration observed in the fourth cut (208.2 g kg-1 DM) and the lowest in the second cut (140.12 g kg-1 DM). The content average in the four cuts for CP and LIG at 28 days of regrowth was 175.85 and 104.33 kg-1 g MS and at 35 days of regrowth interval was of 164.45 and 118.65 g kg-1 DM, respectively. No differences were found between regrowth intervals in the contents of mineral matter and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Environmental factors including the wide variation in precipitation (greater than 200 mm between the peak in December 2010 and the lowest in March 2011) greatly influenced Tifton 85 grass production, affecting DM and the nutritional value of the forage in each cut.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18368/19451,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Grazing behavior of non-supplemented and supplemented heifers on Italian ryegrass pasture,"We evaluated the grazing behavior of heifers, at two phenological stages (vegetative and reproductive) of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), in four times of the day (early morning, morning, evening, and night), with heifers either exclusively grazing or with oat, or corn grain, supplementation. The experimental design was completely randomized, in sub-subdivided plot arrangement, in which the main plots were the feeding systems, the sub-plots were the phenological stages and the sub-sub-plots were the times of day. We assessed ingestion behavior along 24 hours through visual observation, on four evaluation dates, two during the vegetative stage and two during the reproductive stage, studying time spent on grazing, rumination, or other activities, as well as number and duration of, and interval between meals. Supplemented heifers remained less time at a feeding station, performed fewer bites daily and, during the reproductive stage of the ryegrass, spent more time in other activities. Grazing time of supplemented heifers was shorter in the morning and at night, and the duration of their meals was shorter at night. A change occurred in the pattern of time use when heifers received supplement, and when the structural and qualitative characteristics of the pasture changed during the vegetative and reproductive phenological stages of ryegrass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18206/19450,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of postgrazing residue on morphogenetic and structural characteristics of Tifton 85 pastures,"The ideal time to start grazing is when pastures reach 95% light interception. The use of residual leaf area index (rLAI) to time the interruption of grazing under intermittent grazing has recently been studied in forage species in different climatic conditions in Brazil. However, studies evaluating the formation and development of leaves and tillers through morphogenetic and structural variables in functional rLAI are still lacking for Tifton 85 pastures. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of varying rLAI in successive grazing cycles on morphogenetic and structural characteristics of Tifton 85 pasture grazed intermittently by sheep. Morphogenetic and structural characteristics were evaluated in three grazing cycles under three rLAI conditions (0.8, 1.6, and 2.4). The regrowth interval (time taken to return to 95% light interception) of pastures increased from 21.33 to 29.66 days with decreasing rLAI. The leaf appearance rate increased at a rate of 0.02 leaves tiller-1 day-1 and the number of live leaves per tiller increased by 0.41 with decreasing rLAI. Phyllochron, leaf elongation rate, final leaf length, leaf senescence rate, and stem elongation rate decreased linearly with decreasing rLAI. The number of live leaves per tiller was lower (7.97) in the third grazing cycle, probably owing to the higher senescence rate observed that same cycle, while the other variables had higher values. The 2.4 rLAI condition promotes excessive stem elongation, reduced leaf appearance, lower number of live leaves per tiller, and increased senescence of leaves, while the 0.8 and 1.6 rLAI conditions promote desirable morphogenetic and structural characteristics, which correlate directly with forage quality. In order to avoid excessive forage losses, grazing must occur preferentially by the end of March, when climatic conditions still support the appropriate development of the plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18189/19449,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Characters of Pennisetum spp. used for the initial selection in the genetic improvement program for elephant grass,"The present study was carried out at the Experimental Station of the Agronomical Institute of Pernambuco (IPA) in Itambé-PE to analyse different characters for the initial selection of Pennisetum spp. clones based on the coefficient of repeatability and the number of measurements required to predict their genotypic values (with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.80). Considering the high number of genotypes in Phase I of the genetic improvement program and the requirement to reduce this number before progression to Phase II, it is relevant to identify characters with high genotypic values, which are easy to measure or acquire and that can be used in the initial selection. Therefore, we chose to evaluate the coefficient of repeatability and the number of measurements necessary to predict the genotypic values of 23 characters, either morphological or productive, of 472 Pennisetum spp. clones, in non-repeated plots. The coefficient of repeatability was estimated using the components of the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Dry matter concentration, leaf blade colour, midrib colour, leaf sheath colour, and internode colour were less affected by environmental conditions, and it was possible to predict their genotypic values (R2 = 0.80) with a maximum of four measurements, indicating that these characters are predictable and reliable for initial selection of Pennisetum spp.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18188/19640,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Conservation and viability of refrigerated platelet-rich plasma from New Zealand rabbits,"Fifteen male New Zealand rabbits were used in this study, with the aim of storing their platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for 30 days at 4-6 °C to investigate its conservation and viability during this period. Thirty samples of PRP were prepared and sorted into three equal groups (G1, G2, and G3), and every three days a sample was taken out for evaluationof the number of platelets, mean platelet volume (MPV), pH of the plasma, aggregation post addition of calcium thromboplastin, and for the presence of bacterial and fungal contamination. Results suggested that, for the number of platelets, there was no linear relationship over time. However, when comparing the number of platelets pre-storage to that post-storage, a statistical difference was observed. The hemogram MPV variables, pre and post-storage, also did not relate with time however, there was a statistical difference between the MPV of hemogram and MPV pre-storage, and between MPV pre-storage and MPV post-storage. From the pH evaluation, no influence of time on the variables was found, but statistical differences were found in the samples after storage between 30 and 6 days, 30 and 24 days, and 30 and 27 days. Platelet aggregation occurred within twenty seconds in all samples, independent of storage time. There was no growth of bacteria or yeast in any sample; however, mold growth occurred in the samples stored for 21 days from G1 and G3. It can be concluded that the PRP of rabbits can be stored in 4-6 °C refrigeration for up to18 days and still maintain the number of platelets, with no significant pH alteration or bacterial or fungal contamination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23527/19442,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Pregnancy rate evaluation in lactating and non-lactating Nelore cows subjected to fixed-time artificial insemination using injectable progesterone,"Most fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols utilize progesterone (P4) as a hormonal source to achieve synchronization of estrus in cattle. The use of an injectable P4 source to control estrus would be an interesting pharmacological strategy owing to the practicality of parenteral application. However, the effects of injectable P4 on estrus cycle control in cattle remain poorly studied. In particular, no existing studies have investigated the effect of injectable P4 on the fertility of cows subjected to FTAI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy rate of lactating and non-lactating Nelore cows subjected to FTAI with injectable P4. Of the 422 non-lactating cows in this study, 162 (38.3%) became pregnant by 60 days post-FTAI. In the lactating group (n = 516), 166 (32.1%) were pregnant by 60 days after treatment with injectable P4. The proportions of lactating and non-lactating cows becoming pregnant were compared using the chi-square test, adopting a significance level of P < 0.05. It was found that the pregnancy rate of the cows subjected to FTAI with injectable P4 was influenced by lactation status. Lactating cows had lower reproductive performance, possibly because of their higher nutritional requirements. However, the use of injectable P4 shows promising results and may prove to be a useful strategy in large-scale livestock production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23947/19443,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Prevalence and risk factors for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease in the canine population of the tourist city of Ibiúna, São Paulo, Brazil","The aims of the study were to determine the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, and to determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiúna, São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 570 blood samples of dogs were collected from four regions in the 48 districts of the municipality, from September 2007 to March 2008, and submitted for serological examination. Laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence, respectively. Of the 570 animals examined, 13 (2.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2%-3.8%) were seropositive for leishmaniasis, and 35 (6.1%; 95% CI = 4.3%-8.3%) were seropositive for Chagas disease. A risk factor associated with seropositivity for Chagas disease in dogs was residence in a region with a predominance of small farms generally used for subsistence planting and leisure and surrounded by forest areas (odds ratio = 4.20). By contrast, there were no risk factors identified for leishmaniasis, leading us to conclude that leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are present in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiúna, São Paulo; however, additional studies are needed in order to fully define the risk factors associated with disease in this municipality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23509/19441,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physicochemical and sensory characteristics of milk from cows in different lactation stages and calving orders,"Knowledge of the variation in milk composition is essential for determining milk quality, which is defined by several organoleptic properties. This study evaluated the effect of lactation stage and calving order on the physicochemical composition and sensory characteristics of milk from primiparous and multiparous lactating dairy cows. Milk samples were collected monthly from December 2011 to May 2012. Data were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Milk production (PROD), somatic cell count (SCC), and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) were significantly higher in multiparous cows, whereas the casein to total protein ratio (C/TP) was significantly higher in primiparous cows. All milk components except for non-fat dry solids (NDE) were significantly affected by lactation stage. Body condition score (BCS) was not affected by calving order or lactation stage. Color was the only sensory attribute affected by calving order. In conclusion, the physicochemical properties and sensory attributes of milk were affected by calving order and lactation stage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23286/19439,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Effect of colistin and tylosin used as feed additives on the performance, diarrhea incidence, and immune response of  nursery pigs","For the last several decades, antimicrobial compounds have been used as feed additives to promote piglet growth at weaning, through the prevention of subclinical and clinical disease. However, few studies have assessed the influence of these antibiotics on the immune response of nursery pigs, as well as the relation between performance, health, and immunity of animals that receive feed additives. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of colistin and tylosin when used as feed additives on the performance, incidence of diarrhea, and immune response of nursery pigs. In this study, 72 weaned pigs (average age, 28 days) were allotted into one of three treatment groups: a control group (feed with no antibiotics), tylosin group (feed containing 22 ppm tylosin), and colistin group (feed containing 20 ppm colistin). Weekly, during a five week period, the average daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed conversion ratio of the pigs were evaluated. Stools were scored daily, in accordance with a fecal texture scale. Blood samples were collected on the day of housing (d0) and on d7, d21, d28, and d35 for immune cell phenotyping. The results of this study showed that piglets in both the colistin and tylosin groups exhibited a significantly higher average daily feed intake, resulting in a higher body weight at the end of the experimental period (d35) when compared with piglets from the control group. Colistin and tylosin also significantly reduced the incidence of diarrhea. Colistin and tylosin modulated the piglets’ immune responses, particularly on d28, by changing the percentage of circulating B lymphocytes, CD4+CD8+ T cells, and the CD4:CD8 ratio.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22590/19638,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis in dairy cattle in Ipameri, state of Goiás, Brazil","Leptospirosis is a disease with worldwide distribution and with risk to human health. In addition, it affects farm animals, and consequently, causes economic losses to farmers. Therefore, understanding the epidemiological profile of the disease in each geographical region is essential. This study was conducted in the rural properties of the municipality of Ipameri, state of Goiás, Brazil, where leptospirosis has not been reported in dairy farming. The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in dairy cattle, identify the serovars present, and correlate these results with factors that could favor the appearance of the disease. For this purpose, 285 blood samples were collected from dairy cows and microscopic agglutination tests were conducted to identify the 15 serovars of Leptospira interrogans. A structured questionnaire was applied during the visits to the properties to assess the factors associated with leptospirosis. The prevalence was found to be 18.9%, and the serovars present in the region included Hardjo, Wolffi, Canicola, Hebdomadis, Australis, and Icterohaemorrhagiae. The variables associated with leptospirosis were the presence of reproductive changes in the herd, presence of rodents, increased daily production of milk, hired labor, and lower level of education of the producers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22521/19437,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Risk factors associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV seropositivity in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) from the State of Paraiba,  Northeastern Brazil","This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BoHV-1) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) infections in buffaloes in the State of Paraíba, Northeastern Brazil, using 136 female buffaloes ? 24 months old from 14 herds. For the serological diagnosis of the BoHV-1 and BVDV infections, the virus-neutralization test (VN) was used and in each herd, an epidemiological questionnaire was applied in order to obtain data to be used in the risk factor analysis. Of the 136 animals 86 (63.2%) were positive for BoHV-1 and 12 (8.8%) for BVDV. The presence of watering points (odds ratio = 17.68; 95% CI = 3.74 – 83.04) was identified as risk factor for BoHv-1, and animal purchasing was a risk factor for both BoHV-1 (odds ratio = 68.64; 95% CI = 12.28 – 383.73) and BVDV (odds ratio = 3.64; 95% CI = 1.04 – 12.76). The results from the present study showed an evidence of the presence of BoHV-1 and BVDV infections in buffaloes from the State of Paraíba, Northeastern Brazil. It is suggested that control and prevention measures should be adopted, such as the use of diagnostic tests prior to animal purchasing and the use of vaccines to avoid the introduction of infected animals into the herds and the consequent dissemination of the infections, minimizing economic losses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21281/19436,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Characterization of edible films of Swartzia burchelli phosphated starches and development of coatings for post-harvest application to cherry tomatoes,"The market demand for corn starch and cassava continues to increase because of their use in edible applications, their biodegradable nature, and other appealing properties. As a result, there is a need to identify alternative starch sources, for example, the seeds of S. burchelli, with the potential to be modified for use in post-harvest applications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and characterize edible films based on the starch phosphates of the seeds of S. burchelli, with the specific aim to apply these starches to cherry tomatoes for post-harvest conservation. After extraction, the starch was phosphorylated with sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) in different concentrations and times according to a 2 x 2 factorial design with additional treatment (native starch). After modification, the starch phosphates were selected for the preparation of edible films using glycerol as a plasticizer, in proportions of 5, 10, 15 and 20% for each selected starch. The films were measured for thickness, permeability to water vapor and solubility in water. According to their permeability values, 4 films were selected for application in the coverage of cherry tomatoes. The conservation of cherry tomatoes with and without coverage was studied over 8 evaluation times (up to 21 days) at 10±2 °C and 80±5% relative humidity. The weight loss, soluble solids, titratable acidity, maturation index, and firmness were measured every 3 days during storage. The starch phosphates showed a phosphorus content within that established by standards, such that the resulting films are acceptable for use in food for human consumption. The edible films presented with an acceptable appearance and without the development of cracks. The concentration of glycerol and the type of starch influenced the characteristics of the films, increasing the permeability and reducing the water solubility of the various edible films. The best result obtained regarding the conservation of cherry tomatoes was observed for fruits with edible coatings of greater permeability to water vapor; such fruits exhibited only a slight decline in firmness during storage compared with the control. It can be concluded that the modification performed on the starch and the glycerol concentration positively influenced the properties of the edible films, allowing for optimal use in post-harvest applications. Similarly, the edible coatings conferred better appearance to the fruits, maintaining their maturation index and firmness during the experimental period and providing better post-harvest storage conditions for the cherry tomatoes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22672/19431,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Estimated length of soybean phenological stages,"The use of modeling is a trend for agronomic science that aims to detect factors that could limit the growing practices and influence the potential yield of some crops. The objective of this study was to calculate the accumulated thermal time and estimate the phenological stages length of three soybean cultivars in two crop years, using agronomic models associated to meteorological variables. Two experiments were conducted in a field at the Agroclimatology Laboratory (LAGRO) of the Federal University of Santa Maria/UFSM, campus of Frederico Westphalen/RS, Brazil during the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 crop years. A randomized block in a factorial scheme 6x3 with six spatial arrangements (45, crossed, 20, 20x40, 20x60 and 20x80 cm) and three cultivars with different cycles and growth habits (BMX Ativa RR/determinate, BMX Turbo RR/indeterminate and BMX Potência RR/indeterminate) with three replications were used for the experimental design. Sowing was held on 11/28/2012 and 12/02/2013. The assessed phenological stages were sowing-emergence; emergence – final vegetative; final vegetative – full bloom; full bloom – physiological maturity. The duration of each stage was related to meteorological parameters: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and thermal time. Air temperature influences soybean growth and development. The accumulated thermal time varies between years and among cultivars, and it is the main contributor to the estimated duration of the phenological stages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22392/19645,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Experimental infection of broiler chicks with Salmonella Typhimurium from pigeon (Columba livia),"Several cases of animal and human salmonellosis caused by the Salmonella serotype Typhimurium have been reported. In animals, subclinical infection favors pathogen dissemination through feces. In this context, the domestic pigeon (Columba livia) with an asymptomatic condition may play an important role in the transmission of salmonellosis, through the elimination of contaminated feces in commercial aviaries or in poultry feed facilities, causing economic losses to the poultry industry and presenting a risk to public health. This study aimed to evaluate the mortality, clinical signs and the presence of Salmonella Typhimurium in the feces and organs of chicks previously inoculated with bacteria isolated from a pigeon. One-day-old chicks were distributed in two experimental groups (G1 and G2) of 32 birds each, and a control group of six birds. Two inocula of 0.4 and 0.7 mL with 105 and 106 colony forming units were used in G1 and G2 birds, respectively. At 1, 4, 7 and 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) fecal samples were pooled from each cage and individual cloacal swabs were collected. At 14 dpi, all chicks were euthanized and samples were collected from the liver, spleen, lung, cecum and intestine for microbiological analysis. Mortality was only observed among G2 birds (6.25%). Most birds presented clinical signs of diarrhea at 4 dpi and no symptom as observed at 14 dpi. The results from cloacal swabs demonstrated bacterial elimination in 68.8% and 53.1% of G2 and G1 birds, respectively at 1 dpi. Additionally, fecal samples had elevated bacterial shedding in all four periods of observation , with a higher excretion at 4 dpi (62.5%) for both groups. Among G2 birds, 74.2% were positive for the pathogen in the intestine; G1 birds presented the lowest rate of lung infection (29%), and both groups had more than 50% positivity for liver and caeca. The results revealed that infected chicks with a Salmonella Typhimurium strains isolated from pigeons may host the pathogen in several organs, and simultaneously present diarrheic disorders with significant levels of bacterial excretion in feces.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19366/19433,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nematicidal activity of crambe extracts on Meloidogyne spp.,"Alternative methods for the control of nematodes, such as the use of plant secondary metabolites, can be explored for integrated pest management systems. The objective of this work was to assess the best solvent for obtaining allyl isothiocyanate from Crambe abyssinica leaves, and the effects of this extract on Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. Dry leaves of C. abyssinica at 200 mg L-1 were used to prepare extracts by using water (by infusion and grinding), acetone, water + ethanol (hydroalcoholic extraction), methanol, hexane, and chloroform as solvents. Following the evaporation of the solvents, the residue was resuspended in water for use in the experiments. Distilled water and chemical nematicide were used as control treatments. Once the most effective extracts were defined, the following dosages of dried crambe leaves were used: 0, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg L-1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify the allyl isothiocyanate present in the extracts. After the solvents evaporated, the residues were eluted with water and used in assays with 200 eggs for the hatching test or 200 second stage juveniles (J2) for mobility and mortality tests. The hydroalcoholic extract was the most effective in reducing the hatching of M. incognita and M. javanica juveniles, by 71.6 and 74.4 percentage points, respectively. The mortality of M. incognita and M. javanica in the hydroalcoholic extract was 93.2 and 64.4%, respectively, followed by the methanol extract (17.6 and 34%) and the extract obtained by grinding (9.2 and 28%). The hydroalcoholic extract at 250 mg L-1 showed high nematicidal effect. The HPLC analysis of the extracts revealed that only the methanol and hydroalcoholic extracts had allyl isothiocyanate, indicating that the inhibitory effects on the hatching, mobility, and mortality were not solely attributed to the presence of this compound.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22378/19635,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Spatial distribution of organic carbon and humic substances in irrigated soils under different management systems in a semi-arid zone in Ceará, Brazil","Spatial distribution of organic carbon and humic substances in irrigated soils under different management systems in a semi-arid zone in Ceará, Brazil Knowledge of the spatial variability in soil properties can contribute to effective use and management. This study was conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution of the levels of total organic carbon (TOC) and humic substances (humic acid (C-FAH), fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), and humin fraction (C-HUM)) in an Ultisol under different land uses, located in the irrigated perimeter of Baixo Acaraú-CE, transition to semiarid Ceará. The distribution and spatial dependence of the humic fractions were evaluated using descriptive statistics, including semivariogram analysis and data interpolation (kriging). The TOC showed a pure nugget effect, whereas the other fractions showed moderate spatial dependence. Forested and banana cultivation areas showed similar distributions of C-FAH and C-FAF, due to the high input of organic matter (leaves and pseudostems) in the area of banana cultivation and the absence of soil disturbance in the forested area. Data interpolation (kriging) and mapping were useful tools to assess the distribution and spatial dependence of soil attributes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22377/19475,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Comparison between biodegradable polymers from cassava starch and glycerol as additives to biogas production,"In this study, we compared cassava starch-based biodegradable polymers (PBMs) and glycerol (G) as additives used to increase biogas production from the co-digestion of swine wastewater (ARS). We chose to work with an inoculum comprising 40% (v/v) of the total volume of the reactor; this inoculum was obtained from a Canadian model digester for treating swine waste. In the anaerobic digestion process, batch reactors were used on a laboratory scale with a total volume of approximately 4 L and a working volume of 3.2 L. Three treatments were conducted to compare the efficiency of solid removal, the chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the production of biogas. The first treatment contained only swine waste; the second included the addition of glycerol at 1, 3, and 5% (w/v); and the third treatment included the addition of 1, 3, and 5% (w/v) of PBM residue in relation to the swine wastewater. From the results, it can be concluded that higher yields were obtained for the treatment with 3% PBM and 1% glycerol. Most treatments showed high removal rates of total solids and total volatile solids. Reductions lower than 70% were obtained only for treatments with PBM and glycerol at a ratio of 5%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22090/19634,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Base temperature as a function of genotype: a foundation for modeling phenology of temperate fruit species,"To complete each phase of the growing season, plants must accumulate thermal time at lower base temperature (Tb). Little information exists on Tb variation between either fruit species or cultivars of the same species. We therefore aimed to determine the lower base temperature for contrasting genotypes in precocity of peach, plum, grape, pear, and kiwi. Twigs 25-35 cm long for the following cultivars: peach, Tropic Beauty (TB) and Eragil (ER); plum, Gulf Blaze (GB) and Letícia (LE); grape, Chardonnay (CH) and Cabernet Sauvignon (CS); pear, Smith (SM) and Packham’s (PA); and kiwi, Golden King (GK) and Hayward (HA) were collected in orchards in Veranópolis, RS Estate, on 06/13/2014, with 0 h at temperatures ? 7.2°C (chilling hours; HC) in the field. Intact twigs packed in black plastic film were subjected to 1,008 HC at 0°C in incubators to overcome dormancy and then transferred to temperatures of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12°C on single-node cuttings planted in phenolic foam to define effective heat temperature for the genotypes. Over 110 d, budburst of the buds was evaluated in 2-3-d intervals in the green-tip stage. The resulting inverse data of number of days to budburst (1/days to budburst) was inserted into regression curves to estimate Tb for each genotype. Historical phonological series comprised of 10 years for the analyzed cultivars and meteorological data of the cultivation sites were used to determine thermal time (degree-days) for the fruit trees during the growing season, considering different phenological phases. Temperate fruit species exhibited different Tb behaviors: Tb was lower for early cultivars (TB and GB = 2.2°C; CH = 2.1°C; SM = 4.4°C; GK = 4.3°C) and higher for late cultivars (ER = 6.3°C; LE = 6.2°C; CS = 4.3°C; HA and PA = 8.2°C) for all cultures. The Tb f fruit cultivars related directly with genotype chilling requirements: the higher the chilling requirement, the higher the Tb of the cultivar. Cultivars of the same fruit species yielded a sum of degree-days almost equal to finalize the growing season, regardless of the degree of precocity (TB = 1720; ER = 1801; GB = 1680; LE = 1718; CH = 2310; CS = 2369; SM = 2096; PA = 2003 GD; GK = 2775; HA = 2691). Regarding phenological phases, 82% of the assessed cases responded more to thermal time (degree-days) than to chronological time (d) to complete phenological steps. Differences in Tb between genotypes are a relevant factor for improving the accuracy and applicability of phenology models in agriculture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21946/19425,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Growth and nutrient uptake patterns in plants of Duboisia sp,"Characterizing growth and nutrient uptake is important for the establishment of plant cultivation techniques that aim at high levels of production. The culturing of Duboisia sp., although very important for world medicine, has been poorly studied in the field, since the cultivation of this plant is restricted to a few regions. The objective of this paper is to characterize growth and nutrient absorption during development in Duboisia sp. under a commercial cultivation system, and in particular to assess the distribution of dry matter and nutrients in the leaves and branches. Our work was performed on a commercial production farm located in Arapongas, Paraná, Brazil, from March 2009 to February 2010. A total of 10 evaluations took place at approximately 10-day intervals, starting 48 days after planting and ending at harvesting, 324 days after planting. The growth parameters analyzed were the height of the plants and the dry matter of the leaves and of branches, while the chemical composition of the leaves and branches was used to study nutrient absorption. Data were submitted to regression analysis. Growth in height followed Richards’ model, mirroring the rise in air temperature and water availability. Phytomass accumulation in the aerial parts of the plants was slow during the first 150 days, but grew 25 times from that point to harvesting. Starting from 260 days, phytomass accumulation in the leaves began to be notable, while in the branches, a growth of 169% occurred, a pattern of biomass partitioning that is unfavorable for the producer. Accumulation of nutrients mirrored the accumulation of phytomass, showing the same unfavorable partition. The nutritional demand for macronutrients and micronutrients was, respectively, N < K < Ca > P > Mg > S and Fe >Mn> Zn > B > Cu.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22727/19430,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Inert powders alone or in combination with neem oil for controlling Spodoptera eridania and Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae,"Laboratory studies was carry out to evaluated the potential of inert powders: bentonite, kaolin and diatomaceous earth (DE) applied as dust and aqueous suspension alone and associated with neem oil to the control Spodoptera eridania and Spodoptera frugiperda second instar larvae. In dust applications, 100% mortality of S. eridania, at the concentrations of 1.5 and 2.0 grams of bentonite, and 93.3% of S. frugiperda, at the concentration of 2.0 g were observed. DE at the height concentration (2.0 g) caused 76.2% mortality of S. eridania and 46.6% of S. frugiperda. Kaolin, in all concentrations, was the only treatment that did not differed from the control for S. eridania but was different, in the high concentration, for S. frugiperda. When the plants were treated, larvae of S. eridania fed in the treatment DE, had an increase of two days in larval period. For the sex ratio, the percentage of males was greater in the treatments with kaolin, for both species. When powders was applied suspended in water separately or combined with neem oil, the best results were observed in combined of the bentonite (10%) + neem, with 100% mortality for both species, and kaolin (10%) + neem with 78.5% and 95.6% mortality for S. frugiperda and S. eridania, respectively.

1,1978,Hydration patterns and physiologic quality of common bean seeds,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the hydration pattern of landrace bean genotypes and their physiological quality. The hydration curve of eight landrace (BAFs 07, 13, 23, 42, 44, 50, 55, 81) and two commercial cultivars (IPR-88-Uirapurú and Iapar 81) genotypes was determined from seed moisture. Determination of initial physiological quality was performed by germination and vigor tests (seedling performance and accelerated aging). Characterization of the genotypes, regarding accelerated aging tests, showed that BAFs 13, 42, 55 and 81 had the highest physiological potential, whereas BAFs 07, 23, 44, 50 and the commercial cultivars had lower physiological quality. The hydration curve followed a triphasic pattern with radicle protrusion occurring between 21 and 27 hours after seed hydration. The percentage of reserves translocated to the seedling during formation showed that BAF 42 had the highest conversion efficiency compared to the smaller efficiencies of BAFs 23, 50 and Iapar 81. The seedling length test showed that BAFs 42 and 55 had the most vigorous seedlings, which was driven by the high percentage of reserves translocated to the seedling during formation. BAFs 23, 50 and the cultivar Iapar 81 showed lower reserve translocation, demonstrating that low mobilization potential leads to smaller seedlings. The hydration of bean seeds during germination was affected by physiological quality, as genotypes considered more vigorous exhibited higher hydration rates than those of the less vigorous genotypes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21707/19423,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Leaf anatomy of emerald grass submitted to quantitative application of herbicides,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the selectivity of herbicides applied in post-emergence on Zoysia japonica Steud (Poaceae) and determine associations with the leaf anatomy of this grass. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications. The treatments were the application of the herbicides bentazon (720 g ha-1), nicosulfuron (50 g ha-1), halosulfuron (112.5 g ha-1), oxadiazon (875 g ha-1) and 2.4-D (698 g ha-1), plus a control treatment without herbicide application. Phytotoxicity was assessed every seven days after application (DAA) of the herbicides until the symptoms disappeared. Foliar anatomical analyses of the leaves in the collected grass were conducted until the 35th DAA. The quantitative characters of the keel and wing region of the blade of Z. japonica were assessed, as well as the biometric characters, which were submitted to an analysis of variance F test, and the averages were compared by Tukey’s test at a probability of 5%. The values of the anatomical characters of the foliar blade were tested by cluster analysis. The application of herbicides did not negatively influence the height of the plants but did reduce their dry mass. Toxic symptoms disappeared after 21 DAA, with the only symptoms of injury observed in plants treated with the herbicides oxadiazon and nicosulfuron. In addition, the cluster analysis indicated the formation of a unique discriminatory group. Thus, the results show that the herbicides applied to Z. japonica were selective for the species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21488/19633,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro establishment and early development of barueiro (Dipteryx alata Vogel),"The barueiro (Dipteryx alata Vog.) is a native fruit species of the Cerrado ecoregion that has multiple uses. It is a wild species, and its cultivation is difficult. Furthermore, it is threatened with extinction. Plant tissue culture is a major tool for the conservation of germplasm, as well as a means of propagating high-quality seedlings on a large scale. However, this technique has not been used with barueiro, although it might provide valuable contributions to the process of barueiro domestication. The most popular method of cultivation is the use of the Murashige and Skoog medium (MS), which is considered one of the most nutritionally complete media. Woody plant medium (WPM) is indicated for the propagation of woody species, but there are no reports of its use for barueiro cultivation. Woody plants tend to have problems with rust in vitro during the establishment phase. Activated charcoal acts as an adjuvant for the adsorption of phenolic compounds, mitigating its effects in the medium. Thus, the objective of this study was to test four activated charcoal doses (0, 2, 4 and 6 g L-1) and three culture media: MS, WPM, and AA (over water agar) in the in vitro establishment of barueiro. The experimental design was a completely randomised (DIC), 4 × 3 factorial design with three replications. At 60 days after inoculation, the explants were evaluated for dry matter, fresh weight, stem diameter, shoot length, number of leaves, longest root length, germination rate, and chlorophyll contents.

1,1978,Quantification of storage proteins during seed imbibition of native species from the brazilian caatinga vegetation,"Poincianella pyramidalis (Fabaceae), Schinopsis brasiliensis (Anacardiaceae) and Sideroxylon obtusifolium (Sapotaceae) are native species of the Caatinga vegetation from northeastern Brazil and have both biological importance and potential economic uses. Little is known about the water uptake and degradation of storage proteins during seed germination of these species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the imbibition and quantify the amount of storage proteins during seed germination of P. pyramidalis, S. brasiliensis and S. obtusifolium. Two lots of S. obtusifolium seeds with different vigour were used. Four replicates of 20 seeds of P. pyramidalis, S. brasiliensis and S. obtusifolium, were sown onto gerboxes with blotting paper soaked in distilled water and incubated during 72, 200 and 624 hours. Before and after imbibition seeds were weighed and frozen at until the sequential extraction and analysis of the seed storage proteins. Based on our results, we conclude that seed germination of P. pyramidalis, S. brasiliensis and S. obtusifolium has a well-defined triphasic imbibition. All storage proteins content of P. pyramidalis and S. brasiliensis seeds degraded along with the seed imbibition. Likewise, the content of albumins, globulins and glutelins decreased as S. obtusifolium seeds absorbed water.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18909/19418,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genotype by environment interaction of “carioca” seeded common bean advanced lines in northeastern Brazil,"The objectives of the present work were to identify common bean lines with high grain yield, adaptability and stability; stratify the environment; and detect the most important factors for the genotype by environment (G×E) interaction in northeastern Brazil. Nineteen experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with three replications during the rainy growing season at 11 locations in the States of Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Bahia in 2009 and 2010. In each experiment, 16 “carioca” seeded lines were evaluated, and the grain yield, assessed. Data were subjected to analyses of variance and adaptability and stability by the methodologies of Annicchiarico and Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interactions (AMMI), analysis of the factors for environmental stratification and joint analysis with decomposition of the G×E interaction in genotype by year and genotype by location. According to the AMMI method, BRS Estilo and CNFC 11951 were selected as stable high-yielding lines. CNFC 11954, IPR Juriti, CNFC 11948 and BRS Estilo were identified as stable high-yielding lines based on the methodology of Annicchiarico. BRS Estilo was identified as stable according to both methodologies and was therefore considered suitable for growth in the Northeast region for use as a parent line in regional breeding programs. The locations in this region used to test the common bean lines were informative, except Carira, which could be eliminated from the assay network. Interaction among genotypes, locations and years were observed, suggesting that assessments shoud be conducted at the largest number of locations and years, in this order of importance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21096/19669,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Technological quality of grains of common beans selected genotypes from the carioca group,"Common bean variety improvement programs focus on productivity increase as their main goal. However, some characteristics related to technological quality must also be analyzed in order to assure that new recommended cultivars satisfy key commercial standards, related to consumer acceptance. This study evaluated the technological quality of seeds from different ‘carioca’ bean genotypes. We tested seeds from 25 bean genotypes, selected by the State Consortium for Research on Common Bean Improvement (including EMBRAPA, UFLA, UFV and EPAMIG) for the VCU assay of the carioca variety, including 21 new lines and 4 commercial cultivars, used as controls. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. We assessed the following traits: seed shape, seed constriction, 1000-seed weight, percentage of hard seeds, soluble solids content, cooking time, seed coat percentage, and hydration capacity. According to our results, the cultivars that met the commercial standards for seed shape and constriction were EMB14, CNFC 10432, CNFC 10408, EMB4, P-18163, Pérola and BRSMG Madrepérola. Genotypes MAIV-18259, VC-20, VC-23, RCII-219, CVIII-2, EMB4, MAIV-15204, CVIII-5, and BRSMG Majestoso had 1000-seed weight within carioca bean commercial standards (a minimum of 23g per 100 seeds). Most genotypes had no hard seeds. Lines CNFC 10408, MAIV-18259 and P-18163 had the highest soluble solids content. Twenty genotypes had cooking times below the maximum required by commercial standard, with lines EMB9, EMB4, MAIV-18524, CNFC 11965, VC-17, and CNFC 10432 having the shortest cooking time. Lines CNFC 11965, EMB4, EMB14, and CNFC 10432 also had the shortest time to soaking.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18605/19417,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Effects of growth regulator and nitrogen on yield and lodging of irrigated wheat,"High rates of nitrogen (N) increase plant growth, which can result in lodging. To avoid excessive growth of plants, plant growth regulators (PGRs), which cause internode length reduction, can be used. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the N nutritional status, growth, and yield of irrigated wheat as parameters using variable rates of nitrogen and growth regulator. Two experiments were conducted in Rio Paranaíba – MG in 2011 and 2012 using the BRS 264 cultivar. The treatments consisted of two concentrations of N (50 and 110 kg ha-1 as urea) and five concentrations of the growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 L ha-1 of Moddus® containing 25% w/v of trinexapac-ethyl). Each plot consisted of 20 rows of wheat spaced 0.17 m, six meters in length. We evaluated plant height, shoot dry matter accumulation, thousand-grain weight, number of grains per spike, yield, leaf N content in the index leaf and grain, amount of N uptake and export, and lodging index. The PGR resulted in a linear decrease in plant height and shoot dry matter production. However, the rates of the growth regulator did not affect productivity. The rates of N influenced the yield only in 2011.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18603/19416,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Agronomic performance of upland rice cultivars in the southern region of the state of Tocantins,"Behavioural assessment of cultivars adapted to climate and soil variations is essential for recommending genetic materials to producers, achieving higher profitability, and, mainly, targeting regional growth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agronomic performance of upland rice cultivars in different cropping periods and Cerrado vegetation soil in the southern region of the state of Tocantins. The experiments were conducted in a field at the Chaparral Farm and at the Experimental Station of the Federal University of Tocantins in the agricultural years of 2008/2009, 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013 with cultivars BRS-Bonança, BRS-Primavera, and BRSMG-Conai. A randomized block experimental design was used with four replications in a factorial scheme of 3 × 5, comprising three genotypes and five years. The evaluated characteristics were as follows: number of days to flowering, plant height, weight of hundred grains, and grain yield. The highest upland rice yield was observed in the cropping period of 2012/13, which also had the highest volume and better distribution of rainfall; flowering time was lesser and greater for BRSMG-Conai and BRS-Bonança cultivars, respectively. The BRS-Primavera cultivar showed the highest grain yield in different years in Cerrado soil in the southern region of the state of Tocantins.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18224/19631,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Hypertrophic osteopathy associated with systemic granulomatous disease in a horse,"A 4-year-old Criollo stallion was presented at the equine clinic of veterinary hospital of the Federal University of Santa Maria, RS, with a 30-day history of progressive weight loss, anemia and swelling of the forelimbs and face. Physical examination revealed that the swelling was firm and had a bone-like consistency, also radiographs showed extensive periosteal proliferation on the forelimb long bones that suggested hypertrophic osteopathy (Marie´s disease). Physical examinations identified no respiratory findings. However, during ultrasound examination, superficial lung disease was identified. The animal was treated with antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 12 days. Due to a complete lack of response to this treatment, the horse was euthanized. At necropsy several granulomatous lesions were identified in the thorax, abdomen and testicular tunics. Bony proliferation was evident on many bones of the appendicular skeleton and face. Based on these findings the diagnosis of hypertrophic osteopathy associated with sarcoidosis was established. It is important to perform a thorough clinical examination and include hypertrophic osteopathy in the differential diagnosis of diseases that are accompanied by swelling of the face and limbs as edema from various causes, fibrous osteodystrophy, for example.

1,1978,Surgical management of ectrodactyly in a dog,"Ectrodactyly is the term used to designate cases in which soft and bone tissue separation within the distal region of the thoracic limbs is present. It is observed in particular below the metacarpal bones and extending to the radius and ulna. In addition, it can often be associated with ipsilateral elbow luxation. We describe a case of ectrodactyly in a 3-month-old mongrel dog, where bone and soft tissue separation occurred between the third and fourth digits, extending proximally to the carpal region. We identified shortening of the ulna without elbow luxation. The dog was subjected to a surgical procedure comprising bone and soft tissue reconstruction and ulnar diaphyseal osteotomy, which was fixed using a Steinmann pin in the intramedullary canal, maintaining a distance of 1 cm between the two ulnar fragments. Two distal phalanges were removed because it was not possible to reposition them anatomically in the limb.

Hemodialysis removes toxins accumulated in the body directly from the blood, being a useful alternative therapy for dogs and cats with CKD in advanced stages. Because of the difficulty on handling the patient feline, this procedure requires sedation. However, few studies have been conducted to assess the safety of anesthesia in dogs and cats with CKD undergoing dialysis. The present study aimed to evaluate two different protocols of chemical restraint in cats with CKD and the effect of these on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR), since the procedure of extracorporeal circulation leads the patient to a hypotensive frame. Twelve adult cats were used, with an average weight of 4 kg, CKD, underwent two anesthetic protocols: Group GP (n = 6) using propofol, and group GCM (n = 6) using ketamine-midazolam association for the implantation procedure of central venous catheter (CVC) and hemodialysis. Cats in GP as well as the GCM group showed statistical difference in the change in SBP and HR only from baseline compared to the other time points evaluated.

1,1978,"Tuberculosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the Baixo Araguari Region, Amapá, Brazil","Water buffalo are of great economic importance in Brazilian Amazonia, which has the largest herd in Brazil. Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a zoonotic disease that results in severe losses to water buffalo production. Although the disease has already been described in the country, data on the occurrence and distribution of bovine tuberculosis in water buffalo in Brazil is very scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of bovine tuberculosis in water buffalo in the Baixo Araguari River region of Amapá, Brazil. Thirty herds, randomly selected from the 41 herds of water buffalo in the region, were sampled. From those herds, 212 randomly selected water buffalo were subjected to the comparative tuberculin skin test. The proportion of Baixo Araguari River region herds that were positive for bovine tuberculosis was 50.0% (95% CI 31.3% to 68.7%) and the proportion of animals that were positive was estimated to be 14.8% (95% CI 7.8% to 21.9%). Our results show that bovine tuberculosis is spread widely among water buffalo in the Baixo Araguari River region, which suggests that measures to control the disease should be undertaken in the region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20458/18775,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Integrated systems improve land use efficiency as well as preserve, recover and increment or soil fertility. The aim of this research was to evaluate how different doses of nitrogen fertilization can affect production and quality of dual purpose wheat submitted to grazing. The experimental designed was randomized block with five treatments (0, 75, 150, 225 and 300 Kg N ha-1, like ammonium nitrate) and four repetitions. The forage yield, the percentage crude protein (P=.0001) and acid detergent insoluble protein (P=.0054) had a linear increased because of the nitrogen addition doses. The crude protein percentage changed the estimate of all soluble carbohydrates (P=.0001) and non-fibrous carbohydrates (P=.0186), but did not influence the, nitrogen detergent fiber corrected with ash and proteins percentage contributing for content cell. The crops production (P=.0001) and the number of kernels per ear (P=.0001) showed significantly difference because of the nitrogen additions dose, increasing the number of fertile flowers.

1,1978,"Models predict the proportion of bone, muscle, and fat in ewe lamb carcasses from in vivo measurements of the 9th to 11th rib section and of the 12th rib","The present work aimed at evaluating models that predict the proportion of bone, muscle, and fat in ewe lamb carcasses using in vivo data obtained from the 9th to 11th rib section and from the 12th rib. A study population of 30 wooled ewe lambs, derived from Texel breed crosses, were fed with different concentrate levels (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) and slaughtered at a weight of 37.70 ± 10.23 kg. Carcass fat content (FC%) and muscle content (MC%) were estimated from models using the proportion of muscle and fat in the 9th to 11th rib section or in the 12th rib, with or without additional data regarding subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT mm) or carcass ribeye area (RA cm2). Carcass bone content (BC%) was predicted based on the proportion of bones in the 9th to 11th rib section or in the 12th rib. Modeling with in vivo data included fasting body weight (FBW), withers height (WH), and ultrasound measurements of SFT and RA. The FC% could be estimated from the carcass SFT and fat content in the 12th rib. The MC% was more accurately predicted from the proportion of muscles in the 9th to 11th rib section and from carcass RA. The 9th to 11th rib section provided the most accurate data for the prediction of BC%. To determine FC% and MC% from in vivo inputs, the model must include FBW and WH. In vivo FBW measurements alone allow for the estimation of BC%. We recommend the use of 12th rib composition for the accurate estimation of carcass fat content, and the use of the 9th and 11th rib section for the prediction of carcass muscle and bone content. Models using in vivo data for the prediction of fat, muscle, and bone in ewe lambs should incorporate FBW and WH.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21663/18727,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Feed intake, nutrient digestibility, milk production and composition in dairy cows fed silage of wet brewers grain","The aim of this study was to evaluate the supply of wet brewers grain silage with and without nutrient additives in ensiling (wheat bran, soybeans hulls and ground corn), and the effect of additives on the intake and digestibility of dry matter and nutrients as well as the efficiency, production and milk composition of Holstein cows. Four multiparous Holstein cows were used, with an average milk production of 25 liters per day. The cows were randomly assigned, via the Latin Square design (4x4), to one of four experimental diets. The experimental period was 21 days. The results obtained in the experiment were evaluated by analysis of variance, Fisher’s F test and Tukey’s test at 5 % probability. The experimental diets consisted of wet brewers grain silage alone, and this silage with the addition of wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn. The diets did not affect the initial body weight of the animals. Diets containing wheat bran and ground corn provided a higher intake of dry matter (21.78 and 21.50 kg day-1) and organic matter (20.42 and 20.22 kg day-1) compared to the wet brewers grain silage alone and the diet containing soybean hulls. The results observed for dry matter (636.96 and 632.96 g kg-1), organic matter (659.16 and 654.35 g kg-1 DM), crude protein (712.84 and 717.79 g kg-1 DM) and neutral detergent fiber (598.99 and 538.90 g kg-1 DM) when cows were fed diets containing soybean hulls and ground corn, respectively, were higher than other diets. The different diets did not change daily milk production, milk production corrected for 3.5 % fat or milk composition. The milk urea nitrogen from cows fed ground corn diets was a lower concentration (17.67 mg dL-1), however, it was still above the suitable range (10 to 14 mg dL-1). Providing wet brewers grain silage with soybeans hulls or ground corn to Holstein cows increased the digestibility of dry matter and nutrients. However, the use of silages with wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn did not alter the efficiency, production or milk composition of cows fed with these silages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21646/18726,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Ingestive behavior of crossbred Santa Inês sheep fed water with different salinity levels,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of four water salinity levels on the ingestive behavior of non-castrated crossbred Santa Inês sheep. Thirty-two non-castrated crossbred Santa Inês sheep in feedlot, at seven months of age and initial average weight of 21.76±1.25 kg, were used in the experiment. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four treatments and eight replicates. Four concentrations of salts in the water fed to the animals were evaluated: low (640 mg/l); medium (3,188 mg/l); high (5,740 mg/l) and very high (8,326 mg/l) levels of total dissolved solids (TDS). For the ingestive behaviors, the animals were observed every ten minutes, for 24 hours, to determine the time spent feeding, ruminating and idle. Also, cud chewing and the average number of defecations and urinations and the frequency of water ingestion were determined. The time spent feeding, ruminating and idle were not changed by the salinity levels in the water. Dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber intake, total chewing time, total cud chews per day, number of daily meals, average duration of each meal and number of defecations per day did not change either. However, feeding and rumination efficiency in grams of DM/h, water intake and number of urinations were linearly affected, whereas the variables rumination efficiency in grams of NDF/h, grams of dry matter per cud, grams of neutral detergent fiber per cud, number of cuds, number of chews per cud and chewing time per cud presented quadratic effect. The different levels of total dissolved solids (640; 3,188; 5,740; and 8.326 mg/l) in the water fed to the sheep did not cause alterations in their ingestive behavior. In conclusion, water with up to 8,326 mg TDS/l can be an alternative strategic and seasonal method to water crossbred Santa Ines sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21498/18725,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Organs and carcass non-integrant components of Holstein calves, slaughtered at different weights, held in different finishing systems","The objective of this study was to evaluate the weight of the empty body and non-integrant components of Holstein calves carcass, kept in confinement system or pasture, slaughtered at different weights. We used 43 Holstein calves, entire, age and initial body weight of approximately 58 days and 57 kg, distributed entirely at random in confinement or cultivated pasture. In feeding systems, it was pre-stipulated four slaughter weights (SW - 140, 180, 220 and 260 kg of live weight). In confinement, were provided corn silage and concentrate based on corn meal and soybean meal, in the ratio 40:60. The other animals in ryegrass pasture, followed by pearl millet, were fed based in supplementation of corn bran and soybean meal to 1% of live weight. The EBW showed linear growth with increasing slaughter weight (SW), as well as income from hot and cold carcass and there was no effect in relation EBW/ SW. The leather, the scraps, the head, the legs, as well as the sum of external components showed growth in its absolute weight as the weight increased at the slaughter of animals. In relative terms, the hot and cold carcass yields were inversely correlated with the relative weights, as well as external components (- 0.68 and - 0.81), the heart (- 0.35 and -0, 38) lungs (- 0.53 and - 0.53), the sum of the gastrointestinal tract (-0.75 and - 0.77), the sum of vital organs (- 0.71 to - 0.75) respectively in feedlot and pasture. This is due to the different ages that the animals were slaughtered (200; 237; 251 and 263 days of age), due to pre-stipulate weights. The absolute weights of heart, kidney, lungs, liver, spleen, gall bladder, reproductive tract and gastrointestinal tract accompanied the increase in weight at animal’s slaughter. However, when grouped, showed no difference related to the increase in weight at slaughter. The differences presented by the liver, trachea and spleen were sufficient to alter the absolute and relative weights of the set of internal components, where the animals finished on pasture had higher weight. The animals finished on pasture had higher absolute weights (0.48 against 1.18 kg) and relatives (0.31 and 0.79%).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21493/18778,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Energy and protein requirements of crossbred cattle in feedlot,"The objective of this study is to predict the energy and protein requirements of crossbred dairy cattle in feedlot. The study was conducted at the Unidade Acadêmica de Serra Talhada, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Brazil with 30 bulls with a body weight of 339.1 ± 35.4 kg. Five animals were slaughtered at the end of the adaptation period to serve as the reference group; the remainder of the animals was slaughtered after 112 days. The latter group was randomly allocated to receive five treatments: 0, 17, 34, 51 and 68% of concentrate in the feed using a completely randomized design. The dietary intake of the animals that were not given concentrate was restricted to 1.5% of their body weight; these animals composed the group fed for maintenance. The body composition and empty body weight (EBW) were estimated by means of the comparative slaughter method and full dissection of a half-carcass. The results showed that for crossbred dairy bulls in confinement, the net and metabolizable energy requirements were 86.49 and 138 kcal EBW-0.75 day-1, respectively, and the efficiency of use of metabolizable energy for maintenance and gain were 62.67% and 31.67%, respectively. The net energy (NEg) and net protein (NPg) requirements for gain can be estimated using the following equations, respectively: NEg= 0.0392*EBW0.75*EBWG1.0529 and NPg= 242.34 x EBWG - 23.09 x RE. The efficiency of use of metabolizable protein for gain was 25.8%, and the protein requirement for maintenance was 2.96 g EBW-0.75 day-1. The rumen degradable protein can supply 62.44% of the crude protein requirements of feedlot dairy crossbred bulls with a body weight of 450 kg while gaining 1 kg day-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21476/18723,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carcass physical composition and physic-chemical characteristics of meat from Nellore cattle,"Assessment of carcass physical composition and physicochemical characteristics of meat from Nellore males distributed randomly into three treatments: males castrated at 13 months of age at puberty (n=26); castrated at 18 months of age, 15 days before confinement (n=26); and young bulls (n=25). For the evaluation of meat chemical characteristics, we used samples of 12 animals taken at random from each treatment. The experimental design was completely randomized. Animals were slaughtered at 22 months of age after 100 days of confinement. The carcasses of young bulls showed higher contents of muscle (66.46 %) and bone (16.03 %), and lower fat content (17.66 %), in relation to that of steers castrated at 13 (62.83,15.28, and 22.11 %, respectively) or 18 months (63.99, 15.29, and 21.53%, respectively), which did not differ amongst themselves. The meat of young bulls was darker (3.07 points) than the meat from those castrated at 13 months of age (3.43 points), while the meat from those castrated at 18 months displayed an intermediate color (3.29 points), not differing from the others. Young bulls yielded meat with lower content of intramuscular fat (3.18 points) and lipids (3.81%) in relation to those castrated at 13 (4.58 points and 6.77%, respectively) or 18 months (4.52 points and 5.66%, respectively). Protein content was higher (P 0.05) by the age of castration, with young bulls having lower values in relation to the castrated males. Castration of Nellore young bulls in early puberty increases the edible portion of the carcass due to the higher body fat deposit.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21439/18647,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Chemical composition of elephant grass silages supplemented with different levels of dehydrated cashew bagasse,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical composition of elephant grass silages supplemented with different levels dried cashew bagasse (DCB). Our experiment used a randomized design replicated four times, each replicate consisting of the following five treatments: 100% elephant grass; 95% elephant grass + 5% DCB; 90% elephant grass + 10% DCB; 85% elephant grass + 15% DCB; and 80% elephant grass + 20% DCB. The elephant grass was cut manually to a residual height of 5 cm at 80 days of age, and cashew bagasse was obtained from the processing of cashew stalks used in fruit pulp manufacturing in Mossoró/RN. Plastic buckets were used as experimental silos, and 90 days after ensiling the experimental silos were opened and the contents analyzed. The addition of dried cashew bagasse to silage linearly increased the levels of dried matter and crude protein by 0.59% and 0.13%, respectively, for each 1% addition (P < 0.05). The neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent content of the silages was reduced by 0.22% and 0.09%, respectively, for each 1% addition of the bagasse. The total carbohydrate content was not influenced by the bagasse addition (P > 0.05), and averaged 82.29%. The levels of non-fiber carbohydrate showed linear growth (P < 0.05) as the dehydrated cashew bagasse was added, and pH and ammoniacal nitrogen levels were reduced. The addition of the dehydrated bagasse to elephant grass silage improves its chemical composition, and it can be effectively added up to the level of 20%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21386/18733,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Relative growth of carcass tissues of goat kids from five breed Types finished on pasture or feedlot,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cross breeding, finishing system, and gender on the relative growth of carcass tissues of dairy kids. Seventy eight kids (39 male and 39 female) from five breed types were used: Alpine; ½ Boer + ½ Alpine (½ BA); ½ Nubian + ½ Alpine (½ ANA); ¾ Boer + ¼ Alpine (¾ BA); and ½ Nubian + ¼ Boer + ¼ Alpine (TC). Kids were distributed into two finishing systems: in pasture with doe (FS1) and weaned in feedlot (FS2). Kids were slaughtered at a mean age of 128.4 ± 7.9 days and mean live weight of 22.07 kg. The mean weight of half carcasses was 5.09 kg. To determine allometric growth, we used the exponential equation Y= aXb. In the half carcass, muscle tissue showed comparatively early growth in group ½ BA, whereas fat tissue of animals in FS1 had relatively late growth. Females exhibited early growth of muscle tissue, while in males this tissue was intermediate. The ½ BA first-cross improved carcass characteristics by enhancing the growth of muscle tissue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21376/18643,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Partial replacement of corn by forage cactus in the diets of lactating goats,"The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the partial replacement of corn by forage cactus (Nopalea cochenillifera Salm Dyck) in the diets of lactating goats on the nutrient intake, milk production and composition and ingestive behavior. Five crossbreed Saanen x Pardo Alpina goats with body weights of 47 ± 3.3 kg were used in the study. The design was 5x5 Latin square design, in which the treatments were as follows: 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40% of girl cactus included in the diet as a partial replacement of corn, with 0, 18, 36, 54 and 72% of the added the cactus comprising of gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Walp) as roughage in all treatments. Treatment did not affect (P > 0.05) the dry matter intake, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and total digestible nutrients with the increasing levels of cactus in the diet, presenting means of 1.64, 0.26, 0.82, 0.54 and 1.17 kg day-1, respectively. In the same way, no influence was observed on the daily milk production and levels of fat, protein, lactose and total solids of milk, which averaged 1.18 kg day-1; 3.74, 3.34, 5.06 and 13.56%, respectively. The inclusion of cactus also had no influence (P > 0.05) on the ingestion behavior. The treatment with 35% cactus showed a lower impairment of food intake (31%). The partial replacement of the corn by the girl cactus in the diets of dairy goats can be accomplished because it does not alter the intake, milk yield and composition and feeding behavior. The replacement of up to 54% corn by the cactus is recommended to reduce producer costs for food.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21139/18641,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Energetic values and performace of broilers feeding sorghum and soybean meal based diets supplemented with B-glucanase and B-xylanase,"Grains, brans, and vegetable meals may contain non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), which increases viscosity in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and interfere with the digestion and absorption of nutrients. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and determine the metabolizable energy of a sorghum-based broiler diet with and without the supplementation of an enzymatic complex. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with 1200 chickens, using sorghum-based feed with and without the addition of 50 g of enzyme-CCE complex (?-glucanase and ?-xylanase), and with two levels of metabolizable energy (ME kg-1): ME; ME + CCE; reduced ME (-50 kcal kg-1); and reduced ME + CCE. The data were subjected to an analysis of variance and the means were compared using a Tukey’s test at the 5% significance level. At 42 and 47 days of age, the living weight of the birds fed with the reduced ME was low, while birds fed with reduced ME + CCE had the same weight as those fed with other energy diets (ME and ME + CCE). Feed conversion was poorest at 47 days of age for the birds on reduced ME diet. In the metabolic test (with fattening diets) to determine AME and AMEn, the reduced ME diet had the lowest result, confirming the effect of the addition of enzymes. The addition of CCE to sorghum-based diets provides enough enzymatic activity to increase the metabolizable energy of the diet (50 kcal of AME) and influence the growth performance of broilers at the slaughtering age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21098/18777,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Tropical kudzu as a protein source in sheep diets,"Protein nutrition plays a key role in ruminant performance and represents the largest proportion of costs in animal feed. The present study evaluated whether the roughage portion of Santa Inês sheep diets could be supplemented with different ratios of tropical kudzu as a protein source and assessed the best inclusion level of tropical kudzu based on digestibility, intake, nitrogen balance and feeding behavior. Twenty rams were evaluated during the 20-day experimental period, and they were fed formulated diets with a roughage portion (60%) consisting of Elephant grass and tropical kudzu, the latter supplemented at different concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 75% on a dry matter basis). Forty percent of the concentrate portion consisted primarily of ground corn and soybean meal adjusted to obtain an isoproteic diet. Chemical and bromatological analyses, as well as, analyses to assess intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and feeding behavior, were conducted. No statistically significant differences were found (P>0.05) for the intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose (HEMI), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) or for the feeding behavior (feeding, rumination and idle times in h/day) and nitrogen balance between the diets studied. Thus, tropical kudzu can be considered a feed alternative to supplementation with prime protein foods (in this case, soybean meal) in sheep diets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19154/18638,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Carcass and non-carcass components of Santa Ines lambs subjected to food restriction,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex class (castrated; non-castrated) and level of food restriction (0%, 30% and 60% of ad libitum consumption) on the quantitative composition of carcass and non-carcass components of Santa Ines lambs. A completely randomized 3x2 design (restriction level x sex class) was used to evaluate thirty lambs approximately two months of age with an average initial body weight of 13 ± 1.49 kg. When the average body weight of the animals in one of the treatment groups reached 28 kg, all animals were slaughtered. Sex class had effect on body weight at slaughter, empty body weight, hot carcass weight and cold carcass weight. The weight of the leg was greater in non-castrated animals. There was linear decreased effect according to increasing levels of restriction for the carcass cuts, except for leg and rear loin yield. There was statistic difference between sex class for the weights of kidneys, paw, and large intestine of non-castrated animals (P < 0.05). There was a negative linear association between level of food restriction and mass of blood, head, leather, paw, rumen, reticulum, abomasum, small intestine, large intestine; perirenal, omental, mesenteric and heart fat. The quantitative composition of carcass and non-carcass components of Santa Ines lambs is influenced by sex class and food restriction level.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20913/18639,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Meat quality of Morada Nova lambs subjected to different feeding regimes,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pre- and post-calving feed restriction on quantitative characteristics and lipid profile of meat from Morada Nova sheep. Twenty-four male lambs from single births only, with an initial weight of 10.0 ± 3.07 kg and at four months of age, were distributed in a randomized complete design, into three groups: pre-calving restriction (R-PRE; n=8) post-calving restriction (R-POS; n=8), and ad libitum feeding (ADLI; n=8). To make up the experimental treatments, the feeding regime applied previously on the sheep in the last third of pregnancy was considered. Treatments ADLI and R-POS were composed of lambs born from ewes fed ad libitum in the last third of pregnancy. Treatment R-PRE consisted of lambs born from ewes subjected to feed restriction in the last third of pregnancy at 60% of the recommended requirements for the group of ewes feeding ad libitum. For the lambs from treatments ADLI and R-PRE, the diet was supplied allowing 20% of the total supplied as refusals. For the animals from R-POS, a 30% restriction was imposed in relation to the animals feeding ad libitum. Animals were slaughtered with an average live weight of 25 kg. Afterwards, carcasses were chilled at 4 ºC for 24 h. Meat quality measurements were taken on the right side of each carcass; pH was determined immediately after slaughter and then again after chilling. Samples of the longissimus dorsi muscle were collected and frozen at -20 ºC. Moisture, ash, protein, total lipids, water-holding capacity, and cooking loss were determined in the meat samples, which were then subjected to the shear-force test. The sensory analysis was determined by the hedonic-scale test, in which sensory parameters of tenderness, juiciness, flavor, aroma, and overall acceptability and fatty acid profile were evaluated. There was a feed-restriction effect on protein, lipids, and water-holding capacity (P0.05). Saturated fatty acid contents were affected by the treatments (P0.05). Feed restriction does not compromise the physicochemical or sensory quality of Morada Nova lambs meat, but rather provides a meat product of good acceptance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18415/18636,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The objective of this study was to characterize calculi and urine of domestic rabbits treated with mesenchymal adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) after partial urinary bladder allotransplantation. Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were submitted to surgery and treated postoperatively with cyclosporine or ADSCs for immunosuppression. There were no signs of graft rejection in either treatment group 30 days after surgery. Fewer animals presented bladder calculi in the ADSC treated group (33.3%) compared to the cyclosporine treated group (58.3%). Calcium was the predominant component of calculi in both groups. Urinalysis revealed no haematuria or bacteriuria in the ADSC group, in contrast to the results obtained for the cyclosporine group. ADSCs may be an attractive alternative to cyclosporine for immunosuppression after bladder allotransplantation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21193/18628,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Influence of storage on the chemical composition of Stylosanthes hays for equine feeding,"During dry seasons, equines are traditionally fed hay. However, if not prepared under favorable climatic conditions and if not properly stored, hay does not preserve its nutritional value. The aim of this research was to evaluate the chemical composition in Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão and Estilosantes Campo Grande hay varieties, used to feed equines over 225 days of storage. Treatments consisted of Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão and Estilosantes Campo Grande hay varieties, assessed at six moments of storage: 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, and 225 days. The experiment followed a completely randomized split-plot design. In the comparison between varieties, differences (P0.05) over the 225 days of storage.

1,1978,Effects of different hay: concentrate ratios on body and testicular-epididymal biometry and metabolic profile of Santa Ines lambs,"This study was carried out to verify the effects of different hay: concentrate ratios on body, testicular and epididymal development and metabolic profile of hair sheep lambs. Twenty-nine Santa Ines lambs were used. Treatments consisted of diets with different hay: concentrate ratios (100:0-Control, 80:20- T1, 60:40-T2, 40:60-T3 and 20:80-T4). The characteristics evaluated were: body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), hearth girth (HG), body length (BL), height at withers (HW), height at rump (HR), rump width (RW), chest width (CW), scrotal perimeter (SP), testis length (TL) testis width (TW), testis thickness (TT), cauda epididymal length (CEL), cauda epididymal width (CAW), cauda epididymal thickness (CET), scrotal skin thickness (SST) and testicular volume (TV). Blood samples were collected to analyze glucose, urea, albumin, total cholesterol, total proteins, inorganic phosphate and magnesium concentrations. The body and testicular-epididymal measurements increased linearly with increases in the energy concentration in the diet. BW, BL, CW, RW, HG and BCS showed positive high correlations (r = 0.71 to 0.94) with all testis-epididymal measurements. The results of the metabolic profile study showed interactions between the addition of the concentrated feed and time of blood collection on total proteins, albumin, urea, cholesterol, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations. At the beginning of the trial, hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia were verified in T3 and T4. However, the indices returned to normal over time with the continuity in the diet supplied. Hypomagnesaemia was verified in all treatments. The plasmatic phosphorus concentration was sufficiently high at the end of all treatments, except control. In conclusion, the BL, HG, CW, RW as well as the BCS may be used to estimate the development of the testes and epididymis. The metabolic profile results verified that adjusts are necessary in the amount of concentrated feed given to the lambs when Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp) is provided to the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21178/18774,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,"Serological study of the Leptospira spp. infection in sheep and goats slaughtered in the State of Paraíba, semiarid of Northeastern Brazil","The aim of this survey was to determine the frequency of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in goats and sheep slaughtered in different slaughterhouses in the State of Paraiba, in the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 500 goats and 500 sheep randomly selected. To verify the presence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), using 24 serovars as antigens, was used. From the 1,000 animals analyzed, 82 (8.2%; 95% CI = 7.0%-10.5%) were sero-reactive being 26/500 (5.2%; 95% CI = 3.5%-7.5%) in goats and 56/500 (11.2%; 95% CI = 8.7%-14.2%) in sheep. The most frequent serovars were Hardjobovis (14.6%) and Autumnalis (13.4%). In goats, the most frequent serovar was the Hardjobovis, and in sheep the Ballum, with frequencies of 19.2% and 17.9%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the frequency of positive animals among slaughterhouses, both for goats (p = 0.035) and for sheep (p = 0.004), with the county of Alhandra presenting the highest frequency of seropositive animals for both species. It is concluded that sheep and goats from the semiarid region of the Northeastern Brazil may have become adapted to the serovars Hardjobovis e Autumnalis, as well as wild rodents may be involved in the transmission of the disease. It is possible that the climatic conditions influenced in the transmissibility of the leptospirosis, especially in the Mata Paraibana mesoregion, however it was not considered as being sufficient to justify the low frequency of seropositive animals. In this way, it is possible to suggest the hypothesis that the rusticity of the small ruminants in the studied region contributed to the low sero-reactivity verified.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20974/18600,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Blood parameters of sheep with high infection of Haemonchus contortus and treated with “mushroom of the sun” (Agaricus blazei),"Blood and parasitological parameters of sheep experimentally infected with Haemonchus contortus and treated with “mushroom of the sun” (Agaricus blazei) were assessed. Lambs infected with the nematode were divided into three groups: treated with basidiocarp powder from the fungus, wormed with trichlorfon, and a control group that did not receive anthelmintic. Split-plot design analysis was performed where the treatments were defined as plots and four periods of collection were defined as subplots. Interaction between the treatments and the collection periods for the fecal egg counts per gram of feces (FEC) was observed. Treatment with “mushroom of the sun” showed anthelmintic efficacies ranging from 28.6 to 54.2%. Similar performances to weight gain were observed among the groups. A significant interaction between treatments and evaluation periods was observed for erythrocyte counts, hematocrit value, and serum concentrations of albumin and urea. The values of the mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte distribution width, and leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts, as well as the mean platelet volume, varied among the collection days. The administration of “mushroom of the sun” significantly reduced the FEC, did not influence on the erythrocyte count and hematocrit value, which remained within normal limits. However it increased the serum concentrations of albumin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20955/18599,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study evaluated the physical and laboratory characteristics of colostrum from dairy goats in the postpartum period, and the physical characteristics of the mammary glands in the same period. Of the 71 mammary glands evaluated, 12 were positive for bacterial isolates and the most frequent pathogenic agents were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 11). Median somatic cell counts (SCC) in animals positive for bacterial isolates were greater than in animals without bacterial isolates at parturition (696.0 vs. 256.0 x 103 mL –1) and 48 h postpartum (1,350 vs. 437.0 x 103 mL-1). In addition, 34 samples were positive for the California Mastitis Test (CMT; score >1+), indicating a positive relationship between this test and bacterial isolation. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most prevalent pathogenic agents, resulting in increase in SCC. Postpartum changes in mammary secretions were not good predictors of bacterial mastitis.

1,1978,Ex vivo and in vivo study of Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer in the measurement of intraocular pressure in dogs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer in measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in dogs. Twenty eyes were used in an ex vivo study in which the calibration curve for manometry vs. tonometry was determined by artificially raising the IOP in 5 mmHg increments up to 60 mmHg (10-60 mmHg). Both eyes of 10 anesthetized dogs were studied in vivo to compare manometry vs. tonometry. In the ambulatory study, 168 healthy eyes, 74 eyes with glaucoma and 60 eyes with uveitis were evaluated by tonometry, which was performed with topical anesthesia and 1% fluorescein eye drops for the formation of fluorescein semicircles. The ex vivo study showed an excellent correlation coefficient (r2= 0.993) between the aneroid manometer and the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the in vivo study, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) between the IOP values by manometry and tonometry, showing the excellent accuracy of the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the ambulatory study using the Kowa HA-2 tonometer, the IOP values (mean±SD, in mmHg) were 15.1±1.8 (12.0 – 20.0) for the healthy eyes, 25.2±4.0 (20.0 – 38.0) for glaucomatous eyes and 10.1±2.3 (5.0 – 13.7) for eyes with uveitis. There was a strong correlation between the IOP values obtained by direct ocular manometry and those from the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the ambulatory study, the IOP values measured by the tonometer were compatible for healthy eyes and for eyes with glaucoma or uveitis. We conclude that Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer is accurate and practical for IOP measurement in dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20434/18598,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases and resistance in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family isolated from healthy sheep and dogs in Umuarama, Paraná, Brazil","Bacterial resistance is a primary public health concern worldwide. Within this context, pets and breeding animals act as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria (MR), such as those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and those presenting plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR). The aim of this study was to detect the presence of ESBL and PMQR in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, isolated from healthy sheep and dogs from non-intense farming rural properties in the Umuarama region of Paraná, Brazil. A total of 81 oral and rectal swabs from dogs and sheep from 11 small rural properties were analyzed. These swabs were inoculated in tubes containing brain heart infusion broth (BHI), and the resulting cultures were inoculated on MacConkey agar (MAC) supplemented with 10 ?g/mL cefotaxime for the selection of ESBL producers. The cells were also plated on MAC supplemented with 50 ?g/mL nalidixic acid for selecting quinolone-resistant enterobacteria. The bacterial isolates were subjected to biochemical identification tests, antibiograms, double-disk synergic tests, and polymerase chain reaction analysis for resistance-inducing genes (blaESBL, qnr, and genes encoding efflux pump and acetylases). Four (5.00%) bacterial isolates (3 Escherichia coli and 1 Morganella morganii) resistant to cephalosporins and/or quinolones were identified; of these, three (75%) isolates were from sheep and one (25%) from a dog. These findings indicate the presence of MR bacteria in the normal microbiota of the animals studied. Animals colonized with such bacteria can contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance to other animals, environment, and/or human beings and can harbor endogenous infections in unfavorable conditions, which have poor prognosis due to the limited therapeutic options.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21091/18601,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Arterial vascularization of the brain of the agouti (Dasyprocta aguti Linnaeus, 1766)","The agouti, a rodent that is geographically distributed throughout South America, is greatly valued for its meat. This paper describes the arterial vascularization of the base of the agouti’s brain, characterizing behavior, and arterial origin and distribution. Ten animals from the Center for the Multiplication of Wild Animals (CEMAS/UFERSA) were used and the study was approved by SISBIO (report number 32413- 1) and the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA/UFERSA) (protocol 02/2010). After euthanasia, the animals were incised in the thoracic cavity by an injection of red-stained Neoprene latex 650 and the skulls were subsequently opened. The brains were extracted from the skulls for ventral surface analysis and then fixed in an aqueous 10% formaldehyde solution. The agouti’s arterial vascularization of the brain has two main components, namely the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. The agouti’s carotid system accounts for vascularization of almost the entire forebrain, while the vertebrobasilar system accounts for vascularization of almost the entire posterior brain (medulla oblongata, pyramid, trapezoid body, cerebellum, bridge, and part of the third caudal section of the forebrain) through the caudal cerebral arteries originating from the terminal branches of the basilar artery. The main arteries on the brain surface include the basilar artery, which is unique, and the arterial pairs, specifically the vertebral arteries, cerebellar caudal arteries, trigeminal artery, rostral cerebellar artery, basilar terminal branch artery, cerebral caudal artery, communicating caudal branch of the cerebral carotid artery, cerebral carotid artery, communicating branch rostral cerebral carotid artery, choroidal rostral artery, medial branch of the communicating branch rostral artery, internal ophthalmic artery, middle cerebral artery, and rostral cerebral artery.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20200/18596,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study evaluated the physical and chemical characteristics (color, hardness after cooking, water absorption capacity, cooking time, integrity of the beans after cooking, proximate composition and mineral composition) of the following varieties of the common bean: Carioca, IAPAR 81, Saracura, Juriti, Pérola, Colibri and IAPAR 31, all destined for both the internal Brazilian and external markets. The varieties studied had different proximate compositions and contents of the following minerals: K, Ca, N, Mg, S, Cu, Fe and Mn; but identical contents of P, Zn and B. The beans were classified as small in size. The Carioca variety showed the lowest values for L* (41.29) and H* (57.22), and the highest values for a* (12.17), its beans being redder and darker than the others. The Saracura variety showed the lowest degree of hydration (95.70 g/100g), cooking time (22.67 min.) and whole beans after cooking (30%), while the Pérola variety showed the highest values for these same parameters, 106.77 g/100g, 43.67 min. and 82.16%, respectively. No correlation was observed between the calcium and magnesium contents of the beans and the hardness of the raw bean, degree of hydration during maceration, cooking time and integrity of the cooked beans.

1,1978,Serum hepatic biochemistry and electrophoretic protein profile of healthy and Ehrlich tumor-bearing mice treated with extracts of Agaricus blazei Murill,"Compounds isolated from Agaricus blazei Murill represent a group of promising natural immunomodulators for use in the treatment of neoplasms. We have evaluated the serum biochemical profile of healthy and Ehrlich tumor-bearing mice treated with different extracts of A. blazei. Total, supernatant, and polysaccharide extracts of A. blazei were obtained from suspensions (at acidic or neutral pH) kept in a water bath at 60 °C or in an ultrasonic bath at 37 °C. After oral administering the extracts to mice for 21 days, blood samples were collected for determination of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), urea, total protein, albumin, globulins, and alpha-, beta- and gamma-globulin fractions. The presence of the tumor led to a significant increase in serum CK and AST activities and in the concentrations of total globulin and the gamma-globulin fraction, and to a decrease in the albumin and alpha2-globulin levels. The polysaccharide extracts of A. blazei reduced the serum AST and ALT activities, probably due to a hepatoprotective effect. In addition, polysaccharide and supernatant extracts inhibited the tumor-induced increase in gamma-globulin levels. Thus, the supernatant and polysaccharide fractions of the extract of A. blazei have potential for use in complementary antineoplastic treatments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19901/18595,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physical-chemical characterization of pre-cooked mixed rice flour and barley bagasse,"The extrusion processing parameters, chemical composition and water content of the flour mixture may affect the structure of rice flour, leading to products with different rheological behavior and hygroscopicity. Therefore, this work aimed to study the rheological properties and water adsorption of mixed flours of broken rice and barley bagasse obtained by extrusion cooking. Samples were prepared from a mixture of grits/bagasse between 82/18 and 73/27 (w/w) with water content between 18.04 and 26.96%, using a single screw extruder. The rheological properties of the extruded flour were determined by a rapid viscosity analyzer to evaluate the cooking profile of the pastes by observing the pasting temperature, maximum viscosity, breakdown and retrogradation. The adsorption process was performed by weighing the samples stored at temperatures of 25, 30, 35 and 45 °C with water activity between 0.112 and 0.973. The isotherms were fitted using the following mathematical models: Halsey, Oswin, Smith, GAB and Peleg. The extruded composite flours were characterized by their lack of initial viscosity. The pasting temperature (40-67 °C), maximum viscosity (690-1146 cP), breakdown viscosity (0-175 cP) and retrogradation (613-1382 cP) were lower than for raw rice flour. The Peleg equation fitted well to the water adsorption data and can be used to represent the sigmoidal type II shape of the water adsorption isotherms for the extruded mixed flours from rice grits and barley bagasse.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20979/18593,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Depth-stratified soil sampling for assessing nematode communities,"This study assessed the importance of stratified soil sampling on the detection (and therefore the distribution) of nematode communities and the differentiation of ecosystems by collecting stratified soil samples at intervals of 10 cm and non-stratified samples from 0 to 30 cm in two soil management systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage) and in a native forest fragment. The nematode frequency and prominence values were obtained after extraction by successive screening operations, sugar floatation clarification and the identification of nematodes to the genus level. The nematode communities were compared two-by-two based on Sorensen’s community coefficient (CC) and the percentage similarity (PS). Relative abundances of functional guilds were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) and classified in dendrograms. Thirty-two edaphic nematode genera were found, and the nematode communities sampled on a non-stratified basis in the soil profile exhibited a high level of similarity because they could not be accurately characterized. Genera with low abundances were not detected. In the stratified samples, we were able to classify and group the nematodes present at different depths, mainly from 0 to 10 cm. Stratified soil sampling allowed a more accurate characterization and greater differentiation of nematode communities, identifying taxa that occurred at lower abundance levels, irrespective of frequency.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23060/18591,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Saline-sodic soil and organic matter addition in the cultivation of the colored cotton ‘BRS Topázio’,"The prevailing climate of the semiarid region in the northeastern region of Brazil along with inadequate irrigation management, have caused the formation of halomorphic soils, which have hampered agricultural production and environmental sustainability of this region. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence and initial growth of the cotton cultivar ‘BRS Topázio’ cultivated in soil with different levels of exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and concentrations of organic matter (OM) in a greenhouse from April to June 2014. The experiment was set in a randomized block design in a 5 × 4 factorial scheme, with three replicates, and the treatments consisted of five ESP levels (13.6, 22.4, 30.1, 39.0, and 48.0) and four OM concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 15% based on soil volume). Soils with an ESP ranging from 13.6 to 48.0 did not interfere with the emergence and number of leaves of cotton at 10 days after seeding (DAS). At 44 DAS, in the period preceding the flowering stage, ESPs ranging from 27 to 30 promoted greater plant height, stem diameter, and shoot fresh and dry matter. Increasing OM increased the emergence percentage and emergence speed index and, at 44 DAS, increased plant height, stem diameter, and shoot fresh and dry matter. Increasing OM mitigated the effect of the exchangeable sodium up to an ESP of 30 on the number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf area at 10 DAS, and up to mean ESPs of 28.5 and 34.0 for the number of leaves and leaf area, respectively, at 44 DAS.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20992/18590,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Period of time taken by Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Scheweick seed to complete germination,"The period of 21 days suggested by the Brazilian Rules for Seed Testing for the germination test of B. humidicola seeds seems too long for seed producing companies and laboratories since they depend on the results for decisions concerning the storage or the commercialization of the seed lots. So, the objective of this work was to evaluate the possibility of getting germination results of B. humidicola seeds in a shorter period. The procedures consisted in submitting the seeds to a dormancy breaking treatment and to alternating temperatures during the germination test. Seed samples of nineteen S1 and S2 seed lots were submitted to the following treatments: moistening the germination substratum with 1) deionized water (check treatment), 2) a KNO3 (0.2%) solution, and 3) scarifying the seeds with sulfuric acid for 10 minutes. The germination test was conducted under the conditions of 1) alternating temperatures of 20 and 35 °C and 2) alternating temperatures of 15 and 35 °C both with 8 hours of light. Normal seedlings were evaluated in daily countings. The results showed that the germination test of B. humidicola seeds may be carried out under alternating temperatures of 15 and 35 °C without breaking seed dormancy with a final evaluation of the germination 10 days after the sowing of the seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20984/18589,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,"Emergence, growth, and flowering of castor beans as a function of the cationic composition of irrigation water","The use of saline water in agriculture has contributed to the expansion of irrigated areas, especially in arid and semiarid regions, where water deficits occur during various months of the year. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence, growth, and flowering of the castor bean cultivar “BRS Energia” as a function of the cationic composition of irrigation water, including water containing single and multiple types of cations. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in the municipality of Campina Grande-PB, Brazil using drainage lysimeters filled with a sandy loam Ultisol. The experiment was set in a randomized block design, with four replicates each of six water salinity treatments: Control; Na+; Ca2+; Na+ + Ca2+; K+; and Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2, totaling 24 experimental plots, each consisting of five plants. Plants in the control treatment were subjected to irrigation using water having low electrical conductivity (ECw = 0.6 dS m-1), while the plants receiving other treatments were irrigated using 4.5 dS m-1 water containing different ions. Emergence and growth were more affected by the ECw than by the cationic composition of the irrigation water. The order of the cations in the irrigation water, in terms of negative effects, was Na+ > Na+ + Ca+ > Ca2+ > Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+ > K+. The cationic composition of the irrigation water influenced the time interval for inflorescence development and the opening of flower buds of the castor bean cultivar “BRS Energia”, and the most pronounced effects were observed in plants irrigated with calcic water.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20942/18586,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The research was conducted in the greenhouse of the Academic Unit of the Agricultural Engineering, Federal University of Campina Grande-PB. Treatments consisted of five salinity levels in the irrigation water (ECwi) (0.6; 1.5; 2.5; 3.5 and 4.5 dS m-1 at 25 ° C) and four working pressures (60, 100, 140, and 160 kPa), with three replicates. The flow variations of emitters were considered small over time, being within recommendation of ± 7% of the nominal flow with “x” exponent values between 0.02 and 0.09, as recommended by the manufacturer, which was classified as self-compensating. The manufacturing and flow variation coefficients were considered excellent in all evaluations and the operating time did not influence the hydraulic performance of emitters. At pressure of 60 kPa and electric conductivity of 0.6 dS m-1, flow rates near values provided by the manufacturer and more economically viable to the farmer were obtained.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20923/18584,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physiological performance and electrophoretic pattern of isoenzymes in Phaseolus vulgaris Lam. seeds treated with essential oil of Moringa oleifera Lam,"In order to investigate the effect of different doses of essential oil of Moringa oleifera (EOM) on physiological potential and the expression of isoenzymes in bean seeds, an experiment was conducted with two cultivars (Colibri and Campos Gerais) and seven treatments (bactericidal, fungicide and the doses 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8% EOM). Germination, first count of germination, germination speed index (GSI), emergence and emergence rate index (ERI) were evaluated in addition to the enzymes esterase (EST), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and isocitrate lyase (ICL) by electrophoresis. In an experiment conducted in the laboratory, the dose containing 0.4% EOM promoted germination and higher averages for first germination in seeds and GSI in the Colibri cultivar. However, the highest dose used (0.8%) was responsible for the worst physiological performance by the cultivar. For Campos Gerais, increasing doses of essential oil stimulated germination, first count of germination and GSI. In the field, higher doses of essential oil gave higher germination percentages for the Colibri cultivar, not influencing the seeds of Campos Gerais. The ERI was not altered by the treatments with OEM and changes in the molecular forms of the isoenzymes were observed, with low expression values of bands for EST, ICL and ADH-related vigor, the germination of both cultivars, as well as increased expression of SOD, which is associated with reductions in germination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20921/18583,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Phosphorus fractions in an agricultural chronosequence under tillage regimes in the Cerrado area in Goiás, Brazil","The increase in the amount and quantity of soil organic matter (SOM), as well as the use of phosphorus-based fertilizers in the superficial soil layer in areas under tillage regimes (TR), may affect phosphorus (P) dynamics in the soil. Therefore, the aims of the present work were as follows: to evaluate the inorganic and organic fractions of P and its lability levels (labile, moderately labile, and moderately resistant) in a Distroferric Red Latosol under tillage regimes (TR) 3, 15, and 20 years after implementation, and to compare them with those of areas of native Cerrado and pastures. We also focus on analyzing the correlations of the P fractions in these areas with other soil attributes, such as total carbon and nitrogen levels, light organic matter (LOM), chemical and physical granulometric fractions of the SOM, maximum phosphate adsorption capacity (MPAC), and the remaining phosphorus (Prem). In each of these areas, samples were collected from the 0.0-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m soil layers. An entirely randomized experimental design was used. After TR implementation, the constant use of phosphorus-based fertilizers as well as the incremental addition of SOM resulted in an increase in the levels of labile, moderate labile, and moderately resistant organic and inorganic P, with a tendency for total P accumulation to be mostly in the inorganic, moderately labile form. The native Cerrado soil presented high levels of labile and moderately labile inorganic P. Pasture areas presented the lowest levels of labile organic and inorganic P, as well as moderately labile and moderately resistant organic P. By principal component analysis (PCA), it was possible to observe alterations in all soil attributes and P levels of the fractions analyzed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20461/18582,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Densimetric fractionation of organic matter in an agricultural chronosequence in no-till areas in the Cerrado region, Brazil","Mineralization of organic residues deposited on the soil surface in a no-till system (NT) maintains a continuous flow of different forms of carbon (C), which might interfere with densimetric fractions of soil organic matter (SOM). Currently, there are few studies on variations in these fractions in NT areas with different deployment times in the Cerrado region. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the total C, nitrogen (N), and 13C in the soil, as well as to quantify the mass and contents of C, N, and 13C in the light and heavy fractions of SOM extracted using different solutions (water, sodium iodide [NaI], and sodium polytungstate [SPT]) in areas of Cerrado, pastures, and NT with different deployment times with Distroferric Red Latosol soil. The study areas are located in Montividiu, Goiás (GO), Brazil: (1) pasture of Brachiaria decumbens (PA); (2) NT with three years of deployment with soybean in summer and fallow instead of a second crop (NT3); (3) NT with 15 years of deployment with soybean in the summer and maize/sorghum as the second crop (NT15); and (4) NT with 20 years of deployment with soybean in the summer and maize as the second crop (NT20). These areas were compared to an area of native Cerrado sensu stricto (CE). The NT according to the deployment time showed an increase in the contents of C (0-0.05 m) and N (0-0.2 m) in the soil. The origin of C in the soil of the NT areas is associated with C4 plants; however, in up to 0.2 m of the soil profile, the 13C contents reduced according to NT deployment years. Extraction of light-fraction organic matter (LFOM) with SPT better represents this SOM fraction quantitatively and qualitatively than extraction of LFOM with water and NaI. This pattern is evident because of a greater consistency in the mass, C, N, and 13C contents of the LFOM extracted with SPT among the evaluated areas and the lower C content in residual particulate organic matter among the extractants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20459/18581,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,In vitro multiplication of pear tree cultivar Cascatense,"One main obstacle to the development and expansion of pear tree cultivation in Brazil has been the lack of cultivars adapted to the edaphoclimatic conditions of regions with the potential for pear production. Intending to overcome this hindrance, Embrapa Clima Temperado (Embrapa Temperate Climate) developed and released the cultivar Cascatense, with a low cold requirement (~400 h) better suited for Rio Grande do Sul`s and Santa Catarina`s climate. Still, seedlings of high genetic and sanitary quality are necessary for the establishment of a high-yield orchard. Plants with both sanitary quality and uniformity can be obtained through in vitro micropropagation. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the influence of different culture media (MS, MS¾, WPM, QL, and Himédia), concentrations of sucrose (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 g L-1), and concentrations of benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mg L-1) upon the in vitro multiplication of cultivar Cascatense, to establish an efficient protocol to enhance its propagation and reproducibility. The study included three sequential experiments in which the number of shoots per explant, the length of shoots, the number of axillary buds per shoot, fresh mass, and dry mass of shoots were evaluated. Cultivar Cascatense can be best propagated in vitro with the use of Himédia medium, supplemented with 0.8 mg L-1 of BAP and 30 g L-1 of sucrose.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20385/18580,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Allelopathy by extracts of Caatinga species on melon seeds,"The melon crop is of great socioeconomic importance in Brazil and some species from the Caatinga biome show allelopathic effects on other species. The aim of this study was to assess leaf and seed extracts of cumaru (Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm.), the jujube tree (Zizyphus joazeiro Mart.), Jucá (Caesalpinia ferrea Mart. Ex. Tul. Var. Ferrea) and mulungu (Erythrina velutina Willd.) on the emergence of melon seeds (Cucumis melo L.). Leaves and seeds were used to produce extracts for each species at concentrations of a) 1%, b) 0.5% c) 0.25%, d) 0.125% and e) 0% (control). The experiment was conducted with each extract type and its respective concentrations in a completely randomized design, with four replicates, each of 20 seeds. The percentage emergence and rate index, percentage of abnormal seedlings, seedling dry matter and seedling shoot and root length were assessed. Seed extracts of A. cearensis prevented melon germination, whereas the other extracts had no effect on this variable. Leaf extracts of A. cearensis and leaf and seed extracts of Z. joazeiro, C. ferrea and E. velutina resulted in abnormal melon seedlings. The percentage of abnormal melon seedlings exceeded 30% when treated with C. ferrea seed extract at the highest concentration. Most extracts did not affect seedling dry matter, but E. velutina leaf and seed extract increased the dry matter accumulation of melon seedlings and Z. joazeiro seed extract decreased dry matter accumulation at a concentration of 0.25%. The highest concentrations of mulungu and jucá leaf extracts promoted the shoot growth of melon seedlings. The extract from E. velutina seeds negatively affected root length compared to the control, similar to the effect of C. ferrea and E. velutina leaf extracts at the highest concentrations. Extracts of different organs of Caatinga plants can affect the emergence and characteristics related to seedling growth, depending on the concentration. Most extracts did not affect germination or the emergence rate index, but affected seedling growth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19827/18577,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Antioxidant activity and fermentative metabolism in the plant Erythrina crista-galli L. under flood conditions,"This study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of flood tolerance of the root system of Erythrina crista-galli L. plants by measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress components in the leaves and roots. Additionally, the activity of fermentation enzymes in the roots was measured. The following two treatments were used: plants with flooded roots, which were maintained at a given water level above the soil surface, and non-flooded plants, which were used as the control. The measurements were performed at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days after treatment. The following parameters were evaluated at each time-point: the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, the quantification of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in the leaves, roots, and adventitious roots, and the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in both the primary and adventitious roots. There was an increase in the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase in the leaves to maintain stable H2O2 levels, which reduced lipid peroxidation. In the roots, higher activity of all antioxidant enzymes was observed at up to 30 days of flooding, which favoured both reduced H2O2 levels and lipid peroxidation. Activity of the fermentation enzymes was observed in the primary roots from the onset of the stress conditions; however, their activity was necessary only in the adventitious roots during the final periods of flooding. In conclusion, E. crista-galli L. depends on adventitious roots and particularly on the use of the fermentation pathway to tolerate flood conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20376/18579,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Twenty-one multiparous Holstein cows with an average production of 24 L of milk/day, reared with semi-extensive nutritional management, were studied. The animals were evaluated and divided into two groups based on their locomotion score (LS, range: 0 to 4). LS greater than 2 indicated laminitis-associated lesions (lame cow group: LC), and LS = 0 indicated cows without laminitis (CWL). A sample of 30 mm2 was collected from the hoof horny capsule at the abaxial wall to evaluate the concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium. Calcium blood concentration was also evaluated. The LC group had lower magnesium concentration (P=0.008) and showed a trend (P=0.06) for lower calcium concentration compared to healthy animals (CWL), even though all animals were normocalcemic. The concentration of other minerals did not differ between the LC and CWL group. In conclusion, the magnesium concentration in the hoof horny capsule was lower in cows with lesions associated with laminitis, while phosphorus and zinc concentrations were not affected. The relationship between hoof lesions and calcium concentration requires further investigation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20436/19030,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In total, 168 healthy Senepol (n = 80, 28 females and 52 males) and crossbred Holstein x Gir (n = 88, 49 females and 39 males) calves were evaluated. From each animal, approximately 5 mL of blood was collected by jugular venipuncture into a sterile tube without anticoagulant to obtain serum. Serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, and phosphorus; and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were determined on a automated multichannel analyzer. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in serum concentrations for total protein, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio (A:G), creatinine, urea, phosphorus, calcium/phosphorus ratio (Ca:P), AST, and GGT between Senepol calves and crossbred Holstein x Gir calves, but no significant differences in serum concentrations were observed between male and female calves for either breed (p > 0.05). It was concluded that the serum biochemistry profile of newborn Senepol and crossbred Holstein x Gir calves was affected by differences in colostrum intake management and breed characteristics. Also, no differences in blood parameters were observed between male and female calves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20372/19029,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Genetic divergence among pumpkin landraces,"Estimating the genetic variability in germplasm collections is important not only for conserving genetic resources, but also for plant breeding purposes. However, generating a large number of different categories data (qualitative and quantitative) often complicate the analysis and results interpretation, resulting in an incomplete distinction of accessions. This study reports the characterization and evaluation of 14 pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) accessions collected from farms in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro state. Genetic diversity among accessions was also estimated using qualitative and quantitative variables considering joint analysis. The plants were grown under field conditions in a randomized block design with three replications and six plants per plot. Eight qualitative traits (leaf size; seed shape; seed color; color of the fruit pulp; hollow; fruit shape; skin color, and fruit skin texture) and eight quantitative traits (fruit weight; fruit length; fruit diameter; soluble solids, 100 seed weight, and wall thickness measured in the middle and in the lower stem) were evaluated. The data were analyzed considering the Gower distance, and cluster analysis was performed using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Variability among accessions was observed considering morphoagronomic data. The Gower distance together with UPGMA cluster allowed for good discrimination between accessions in the groups, demonstrating that the simultaneous analysis of qualitative and quantitative data is feasible and may increase the understanding of the variation among accessions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19149/18575,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Estimating chlorophyll content from Eucalyptus dunnii leaves by reflectance values,"This study aimed to estimate photosynthetic pigments contents from leaves of Eucalyptus dunni Maiden based on values of reflectance spectra of red, green and blue colors obtained with a digital color analyzer. We collected fifty leaves from the lower third of the crown of twenty trees including young as well as mature leaves. From each leaf an area of 14 cm2 of the leaf blade was cut in which we measured reflectance values on the red, green and blue spectra with a portable digital colorimeter, obtained relative index of chlorophyll with a SPAD – 502 and determined the content of the chlorophyll a, b, and a + b by classic method of solvent extraction. We submitted the data to multiple linear regression and nonlinear analysis at 5% of error probability. It was evaluated the occurrence of multicollinearity. The negative exponential model resulted in good fit when data from red spectrum was used for chlorophyll a, green spectrum for chlorophyll b and a + b, making possible correlation coefficients between the estimated values and the extracted above 0.85. Except for the chlorophyll a content, the accuracy in estimates of photosynthetic pigments were higher than estimated by the chlorophyll meter, even with linearity between methods. Therefore, it is possible to estimate photosynthetic pigments on E. dunni leaves through values of red and green wavelengths from a digital color analyser.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21371/18970,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nitrogen fertilization for wheat growing in dual purpose integrated system of agricultural production,"Nowadays, there are numerous arrangements of Integrated Systems of Agricultural Production, due, the particularities of each region and/or rural enterprise. The use of dual-purpose species such as, for example, BRS Tarumã® wheat further intensifies the system, because there is plant-animal production in a short time. Study aimed to evaluate the production and chemical composition of dual purpose wheat pastures managed with different DAN during periods of spikelet terminal (ST) and anthesis (AN), aiming crop production (pasture and grain) and animal (milk and / or meat). The experimental randomized block design with five treatments (0, 75, 150, 225 e 300 Kg de N ha-1, in the form of ammonium nitrate) and four replications. The average biomass values before the first and the second grazing were respectively: 2,164 and 2,127 kg DM per hectare and the waste of about 824 and 1,772 kg of DM per hectare and the daily average accumulation rate between the two grazing DM was 86 kg per hectare at 17 day intervals. The variables, number of spikes per square meter, grain number per square meter, thousand grain weight, hectoliter weight and grain yield did not differ (P>0.05) between treatments. Nitrogen fertilization increases linearly (P=0.0017) the size of the spikes depending on nitrogen rates. For the linear variable layering increased (P=0.0001), indicating the susceptibility of the crop to high levels of nitrogen. The application of nitrogen fertilizer levels in dual purpose grazed wheat before the spikelet terminal stage and anthesis does not influence on grain yield variables. The nitrogen fertilization on wheat double purpose must be fractionated at tillering and after each grazing increasing the remobilization rate of nitrogen by culture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23758/19085,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Thus a study was conducted to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter (ADCDM), crude protein (ADCCP), gross energy (ADCGE) and amino acids (ADCAA) of conventional feed ingredients for juvenile silver mojarra (13.0 ± 3.23 g). The study was conducted in the laboratory for nutrition and feeding of fish (AQUANUT), using 80 silver mojarra collected in nature, which were kept in digestibility aquaria for a period of 21 days. The following ingredients were evaluated: fish meal, soybean meal, corn meal, corn gluten meal, rice bran, wheat bran and starch, which substituted 30% of a reference pelletized diet with 325.00 g kg-1 crude protein and 3,692 Kcal kg-1 gross energy. Additionally 1.0 g kg-1 chrome oxide was added to each diet as a marker. The excreta were obtained using three repetitions for each tested ingredient, which were dried for further analyses. The soybean meal showed the best ADCDM value (67.45%), followed by the other ingredients. There was no significant difference between the soybean meal (95.16%), fish meal (92.97%) and the corn meal (91.90%) for the best ADCCP coefficients. The ADCGE for soybean meal and maize meal were 65.23% and 60.31%, respectively, followed by fish meal (51.85%). The results demonstrate that silver mojarra can digest animal protein as well as that of vegetal origin. Silver mojarra can also efficiently digest and absorb some of the main amino acids of fish, such as lysine, methionine and threonine, from the same studied ingredients.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22066/19049,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Sperm motility, fertilization, and larval development of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) in copper-contaminated water","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of copper-contaminated water on sperm motility, fertilization, and embryonic and larval development of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). A randomized experimental design with five treatments and four replicates was used. Two experiments were carried out: (1) controlled fertilization was performed under different levels of copper contamination and egg hatching was performed in clean water; and (2) copper-contaminated water was used for both fertilization and hatching assays. The time of sperm motility and sperm motility rates linearly decreased with increasing copper concentration in the water. Fertilization and hatching rates were also affected when the concentrations of copper in the water were above 0.0979 mg Cu+2 L-1 and 0.0331 mg Cu+2 L-1, respectively. Gamete exposure to levels between 15 mg Cu+2 L-1 and 60 mg Cu+2 L-1 for short periods of time negatively affected sperm motility, oocyte fertilization, and egg hatching rates. In addition, when gametes and embryos were exposed at levels above 0.03 mg Cu+2 L-1 during long periods of time, egg hatching rates were reduced, and at levels between 0.05 mg Cu+2 L-1 and 0.20 mg Cu+2 L-1 the number of abnormal larvae increased.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22327/19050,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Silage production and the chemical composition of corn and Grass-tanzania intercropping,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the production and chemical composition of silages of grass Tanzania and corn, grown single or intercropping. The experiment was conducted at UTFPR Câmpus Dois Vizinhos in the period between October 2011 and July 2012, a 600 m² area. The treatments were: TMI - single corn, TMT - corn and grass Tanzania consortium at the time of sowing, TT - Tanzania grass single, TT32 - grass Tanzania silage to 32% dry matter (content similar to that of corn). The experimental design a randomized block design with four treatments and five replications. Agronomic evaluations were performed 120 days after planting, as follows: number of linear-1 plants metro, plant height and ear insertion and number of ears.plants-1. In the grass we evaluated canopy height, where it was held the botanical separation in green leaves, dried and stem. Silage started being held in 100 mm PVC pipe (mini-silos) kept sealed for 60 days. At the time of opening of the silo were determined the following parameters: DM, pH, total loss of DM (PDM), specifies mass (SM), dry matter recovery indices (IRDM), losses gas (LG), and size particle. Chemical analysis of the results of OM, MM, ADF were higher for TMI treatments, TT and TT, respectively. CP and LIG had superior results for the treatments containing grass. Corn intercropping with grass Tanzania silage provides more crude protein and lignin compared to exclusive corn silage without damaging the crop yield. Silage maiden Tanzania has higher levels of ADF and crude protein as well as increased production of dry matter than corn silage. The grass Tanzania should be harvested with 30% DM as presented better pH values, higher dry matter recovery rate, less loss of gas as well as increased production of dry matter that Tanzania harvested at the same age corn.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21765/19084,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Cryopreservation of Prochilodus brevis semen: freezing media and thawing rates,"Prochilodus brevis is a migratory fish, an important component of its river ecosystem and an appreciated animal in northeastern cuisine. However, human activities have threatened its survival. Thus, researchers have become interested in developing genetic material storage protocols, such as seminal cryopreservation. Therefore, determination of the appropriate freezing media and thawing rate is a fundamental step toward the use of this biotechnology in the production of common curimatã and for reducing risks to the species’ survival. As such, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of different freezing media and thawing rates on the quality of cryopreserved semen from P. brevis. For this study, males received a single dose of pituitary extract of carp 18 hours before semen collection. The semen samples were diluted in 5% glucose + 10% methyl glycol (MG), 5% glucose + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.9% NaCl + 10% methyl glycol, and 0.9% NaCl + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, loaded into 0.25-mL straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor. The semen from each treatment was thawed at three different thawing rates: 25 °C for 30 sec, 30 °C for 16 sec and 40 °C for 12 sec. Motility, vitality and morphology analyses were performed by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). The characteristics of the fresh sperm mostly resembled those found in the literature. For the parameters analyzed, fresh sperm presented higher sperm quality in comparison to all treatments with cryopreserved sperm (p < 0.05), except for the characteristic of normal morphology, for which the sperm cryopreserved in glucose and MG did not differ statistically from the fresh sperm. For the cryopreserved semen, the greatest results of total motility and curvilinear velocity (VCL) were obtained using glucose and DMSO, regardless of the thawing rate employed. For the straight-line velocity (VSL) and average path velocity (VAP), DMSO showed the best results, regardless of the diluent and thawing rate. With regard to vitality, the highest values were achieved when DMSO and thawing rates of 30 °C for 16 sec or 40 °C for 12 sec were used. In the morphological analysis, the greatest percentage of normal sperm cells was obtained using thawing rates of 25 °C for 30 sec and 40 °C for 12 sec, regardless of the freezing media. Sperm quality was found to suffer interference from the freezing media, as well as from interaction between its components (diluent and cryoprotectant) and the thawing rate used. Under the methodological conditions employed, the use of 5% glucose + 10% DMSO and a thawing rate of 30 °C for 16 seconds or 40 °C for 12 seconds is recommended for P. brevis semen cryopreservation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22003/19048,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Feeding behavior of lambs fed diets containing peach palm meal,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feeding behavior of lambs fed diets containing peach palm meal replacing maize (0, 10, 40, 60, and 85% DM). Thirty Santa Inês sheep with an average initial body weight of 21.6 ± 0.87 kg were distributed in a completely randomized design with five diets and six replicates. Feeding time in min kg–1 DM and min kg–1 NDFap increased by 34 min and 99.6 min, respectively, with each level of substitution of maize for the peach palm meal. Rumination and chewing times, in min kg–1 DM and min kg–1 NDF, also increased in response to the substitution of maize for peach palm meal. When expressed in min day–1, rumination and chewing activities decreased by 12.4 and 14.6 min, respectively, as the amount of peach palm meal in the concentrate was increased. The time spent idle increased linearly (P < 0.05), by 14.6 min day–1, with the replacement levels, compared with the control diet. Peach palm meal in the composition of sheep diets reduces the intakes of dry matter and fiber and decreases the feed and rumination efficiencies. Replacing maize by peach palm meal increases the feeding time and rumination and chewing activities of feedlot lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21936/19047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Performance and economic viability of feedlot sheep fed different levels of roughage, concentrate, and water","The aim of this study was to evaluate performance and economic viability of producing sheep fed different levels of roughage, concentrate, and water. Forty Santa Inês crossbred sheep with an average initial weight of 18.85 ± 2.80 kg and an average age of 5.0 ± 2.0 months were distributed in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement composed of two proportions of roughage and concentrate (30:70 and 70:30) and two levels of water supply (ad libitum, and 50% restriction), with 10 replicates. Water restriction had a negative effect (P0.05) feed conversion or feed conversion. Total weight gain, average daily gain, feed conversion, and feed efficiency were influenced by the proportions of roughage and concentrate. In conclusion, the diet with 70% roughage, associated with a water restriction of 50%, reduced the uptake of energy and protein, compromising the animal performance. The combination of the diet plus concentrate and water restricted to 50% of the free consumption provides a better cost-benefit ratio.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21743/19044,E-ISSN 1679-0359

1,1978,Impact of body condition on postpartum features in morada nova sheep,"This study evaluated the impact of nutritional status of Morada Nova sheep at lambing on the reproductive and productive performance and on the survival of lambs in early weaning system. Nineteen, Morada Nova sheep were assigned to two groups according to body condition score (BCS) at lambing: low BCS (n = 11) and high BCS (n=8) with body condition respectively of (mean ± SD) 2.0 ± 0.3 e 2.9 ± 0.1. From birth until lamb weaning (45 days), sheep were weighed weekly and checked the BCS, loin subcutaneous fat thickness, loin depth, hematological profile, milk composition and production, and every three days, we measured the uterine diameter. Lamb weightings were performed up to one week after weaning (52 days). The lower availability of muscle and fat reserves in the low BCS group negatively affected milk production and consequently performance of suckling lambs. However, the results indicated that the uterine involution process, the reproductive parameters including prolificacy, rate of multiple births, number of white blood cells, milk quality, body weight of lambs at birth and mortality rates were not affected by the body condition. The results allowed to describe the responsiveness to opposite nutritional status of Morada Nova sheep, showing their characteristics of adaptation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21699/19043,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Typology of dairy production systems from West Parana State based on production indices and feed used,"The dairy industry is characterised by a wide diversity of production systems. In this diverse environment, some of the difficulties can be minimised through the grouping of production units through the study of typology. The objective was to characterise the systems of milk production from West Parana State by considering production rates, area, power, facilities, and marketing of milk. To this end, 735 semi-structured interviews with dairy farmers were performed by using a questionnaire for management practices and feed that is used on the farms. To obtain the explanatory variables used for principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), a homogeneous division of 735 farmers in five groups was used. Ten per cent of producers were randomly selected for the performance of field visits to the properties, where a new questionnaire was applied with specific points regarding feeding management on the property, and feed was collected to determine its composition. The collected data were tabulated and feed was ranked based on the classification proposed by the NRC (2001). Analyses of feed were carried out in the Laboratory of Animal Nutrition of Unioeste. The West Parana State has five groups of dairy production systems. There is great variability in the fresh forages that are used, but maize silage is the main forage utilised for fermented feed, and concentrate supplementation is adopted by more than 60% of farms during both seasons. Changes in the levels of feed components are high among systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21680/19042,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Order of amino acid inclusion in the diet of DeKalb White laying hens,"Three hundred and twenty-four DeKalb White laying hens aged 42 weeks were distributed in a completely randomised design with nine treatments and six replicates of six birds in each treatment. The experiment lasted 112 days. Diets were: T1 = 16.02% crude protein - CP [Met + Lys + Thr + Trp + Val]; T2 = 14.02% CP [Met + Lys + Thr + Trp + Ile + Val]; T3 = 14.02% CP [no amino acid supplementation]; T4 = 14.02% CP [Met + Lys + Thr + Trp]; T5 = 14.02% CP [Met + Lys + Thr]; T6 = 14.02% CP [Met]; T7 = 14.02% CP [Lys]; T8 = 14.02% CP [Thr]; T9 = 14.02% CP [Trp]. Regarding the quality of the eggs, the percentage of yolk and albumen, shell thickness and Haugh unit were not affected by the different diets. The percentage of shell, specific gravity and albumen height showed significant differences. We found that supplementation of only one amino acid in the diet (T7, T8 or T9), with the exception of methionine (T6), worsened performance relative to the control. Supplementation of three amino acids (methionine, lysine and threonine; T5) or four amino acids (methionine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan; T4) worsened egg production and conversion per mass and per dozen eggs; however, feed intake and egg weight and mass were similar to the control treatment. When all amino acids (methionine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine and valine; T2) were supplemented performance was similar to the control treatment in all variables. Supplementation of methionine, lysine and threonine is essential for birds in the laying phase; however the addition of six essential amino acids (lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and isoleucine) to the diet of laying hens is important for a good productive performance comparable with the control treatment T1. However, the inclusion of the latter two (isoleucine and valine) is justified only if the production cost is lower.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21504/19083,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Supplementation of grazing suckling beef calves receiving different energy sources,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different energy sources - corn, sorghum, and wheat bran - on performance, intake, digestibility, and nitrogen utilization efficiency of beef calves subjected to creep feeding. Thirty-four calves (12 males and 22 females) with initial age and weight of four months and 108±3.9 kg, respectively, were used in a randomized-block experimental design with four treatments and two blocks (males and females). Treatments were control (MM), a mineral mixture ad libitum; corn (C); corn + sorghum (C+S); and corn + sorghum + wheat bran (C+S+WB). Supplements contained approximately 20% crude protein (CP), and were fed in the amount of 0.5% of body weight. Supplemented animals had higher performance (P < 0.05) when compared with those on treatment MM. Supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (NDFap), non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), digestible neutral detergent fiber (dNDF), and digestible organic matter (dOM). The digestibility of NFC was higher (P < 0.05) in the supplemented treatments. The C+S and C+S+WB treatments provided increased digestibility (P < 0.05) of OM, CP, and NDFap. The synthesis of nitrogen compounds was higher (P < 0.05) in animals on treatment C as compared with those on the other supplemented treatments. Animals on treatments C+S and C+S+WB had higher (P < 0.05) nitrogen utilization efficiency compared with those on the other treatments. Concentrate supplementation improved the animal performance. The use of other energy sources (sorghum or wheat bran) in association with corn is recommended for suckling calves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21500/19039,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Meat quality of castrated and non-castrated Santa Ines lambs subjected to food restriction,"This study aimed to evaluate the quality of meat of castrated and non-castrated Santa Ines lambs submitted to food restriction. Were used 30 lambs, 15 castrated and 15 non-castrated, about two months of age and average initial body weight of 13.00 ± 1.49 kg. The lambs were distributed in a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (restriction level x sex class), according to the amount of food provided. The duration of the experiment was determined by the time required for the animals in the one of the groups achieved 28 kg of body weight. There was interaction between food restriction levels and sex class to the variables intensity of yellow color and pH in the longissimus lumborum muscle and the shear force in the semimembranosus muscle. In non-castrated animals, the intensity of yellow color was higher in the longissimus lumborum muscle at the level of 30% of food restriction. There was no significant interaction between food restriction levels and sex class for the quality aspects related to color saturation, color tone, luminosity, red intensity, water holding capacity and cooking losses in longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus muscles. Although food restriction and sex class have influenced the variables related to the quality of meat of the animals evaluated, the mean values are considered acceptable by the literature.

1,1978,Sensory evaluation of beef and buffalo extensively reared and its relationship to sociodemographic characteristics of consumers,"Sensory characteristics of meat from different animal types, including cattle (Angus and Brangus) and buffalo raised at pasture, and information on socio-demographic determinants of consumer preference were evaluated. Samples of roasted rib eye were cut and served in a disordered and monadic manner to 188 untrained tasters. A nine-point hedonic scale was used to assess odor, color, tenderness, succulence and overall appearance. Analysis of variance was carried out using the GLM procedure of SAS®, considering animal type and socio-demographic characteristics as fixed effects and using the LSMEANS procedure for multiple mean comparisons. Differences (P < 0.001) between animal types were observed only for tenderness, with Brangus (7.02) and buffalo (6.82) meat being superior to Angus (6.25). Regardless of meat origin, age, income, smoking and place of purchase affected the perceived attributes (P < 0.05). People aged over 50 years gave higher mean scores for odor and color (P < 0.05), indicative of greater satisfaction and less demanding tastes when compared to other age categories. Despite the variability in the intrinsic characteristics, differentiation of meat by the consumer is not easy to determine, with little impact of sociodemographic characteristics on organoleptic perception. Meat from Brangus cattle and buffaloes raised at pasture was considered tenderer than that from Angus cattle raised under the same conditions by an untrained taste panel compared with.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21770/19046,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Tobiatã) pasture,"Sixty goats (20 Alpine, 18 Anglo-Nubian, and 22 crossbred Boer), with average body weight 49.33 ± 1.41 kg, were raised on Panicum maximum cv. Tobiatã pasture with two different levels of concentrate supplementation, 300 (SL30) and 600 g kg-1 (SL60) of the daily requirements, and evaluated from the pre-mating season until an average of 110 days of lactation. Milk controls were performed every 14 days. The following milk production curve parameters were estimated: time to reach peak milk production (TP), peak milk production (PP) and milk production during the first 110 days of lactation (MP). The following milk components were determined: fat, protein, lactose, total solids (TS), defatted dry extract (DDE), urea nitrogen (UN) concentrations, and somatic cell count (SCC). Goat prolificacy and birth weight of the kids were also determined. Breed affected the lactation curve, with Alpine and Anglo- Nubian goats presenting higher TP, PP, and MP. Protein, TS, and DDE concentrations were also affected by breed, being higher for crossbred Boer goats. Milk fat, lactose concentrations, and the log of SCC were affected by the concentrate supplementation level, being higher for SL30, as well as by the breed, with crossbred Boer goats presenting higher fat concentrations and log of SCC, and crossbred Boer and Alpine goats presenting higher lactose concentrations. UN was affected by the stage of lactation. Prolificacy and birth weight were affected by breed and concentrate supplementation level, being higher for Anglo-Nubian and crossbred Boer goats with SL60. Kids from single births presented higher birth weights. The Anglo-Nubian breed presented good milk production and the best body condition, which might indicate the effectiveness of this production system, SL60 supplementation resulted in higher birth weight and prolificacy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18636/19036,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Forage mass, chemical composition and leaf chlorophyll index of signal grass and organic matter in soil under increasing levels of nitrogen","This study evaluated the forage mass, plant height, chemical composition and chlorophyll index of signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk), as well as the content of organic matter (OM) in soil under increasing levels of nitrogen. The experiment was conducted in the Rio Manso Farm, experimental unit of the Federal University of the Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys - UFVJM in the municipality of Couto de Magalhães de Minas, state of Minas Gerais. For plant evaluation, we use a split plot randomized block design with four replications. Nitrogen levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 kg ha-1 N) were assigned to plots and the cuts made in plants, to subplots. For the assessment of soil organic matter, we used a split-split-plot, with nitrogen levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha-1 by cut) in the plots, collection depth (0-10 and 10-20 cm) in the subplots and three sampling times (before the onset of the experiment, at the end of the 1st crop year and at the end of the 2nd crop year) in sub-subplots in a randomized block design with four replications. It can be concluded that nitrogen fertilization linearly increases forage mass, plant height and crude protein content of signal grass, which are positively correlated with chlorophyll index. At the end of two agricultural years, the content of organic matter in the soil decreases, which can be attributed to management of cutting and removal of the cut material.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20450/19089,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was factorial (three factors), in randomized blocks, having as factors the cultivars (2), the occupancy area of forage peanut (4) and the seasons (3), with three replications, established in plots. There were three assessments during the study, in spring, summer and autumn, in which the total number of tillers, the culm and leaf elongation, the senescence rate and leaf emergence, the phyllochron, the leaf lifespan, the leaf number and the height of culm and canopy were evaluated. The number of green leaves, number of elongating leaves and senescence rate were similar among cultivars, but cv. Coastcross-1 showed higher number of expanded leaves and leaf emergence rate, and lower phyllochron and leaf lifespan. We observed lower rates of senescence and higher leaf emergence in spring, and lower rates of leaf elongation in autumn. The increasing participation of forage peanut in the pastures did not affect the calculated morphogenetic variables, but decreased the number of grass tillers. A lower average daily thermal accumulation decreased the development of both grasses in this study, with a more pronounced effect in cv. Tifton 85. The Coastcross-1 cultivar has higher elongation rate and leaf emergence, coupled with lower phyllochron and leaf lifespan, indicating a need for shorter rest periods when compared to cv.

A total of 112 questionnaires were administered on rural properties with dairy cow milk production in the municipalities of Ulianópolis and Irituia from April to May 2013. The activity was conducted mainly by men between 36 and 70 years of age. The education level was low, with 67% of the cattle breeders having incomplete basic education and 20.5% being illiterate. Regarding herd feeding, only 19.6% of the breeders used energy supplements, and 13.39% used roughage supplements. Sanitation control was performed by 99.1% of the breeders, with vaccines against foot and mouth disease and brucellosis being the most common vaccines because they are mandatory. Milking was performed manually on 98.2% of the properties, and pre-dipping and post-dipping techniques were used on only 2.7% and 3.6% of the properties, respectively. Regarding management, 84.8% of the breeders did not perform financial planning, and 99.1% did not have a defined chart of accounts and cost centres and were unaware of their production costs. Average herd productivity was 4.34 L cow-1 day-1, with average production varying between 30 L day-1 in units with fewer than 10 lactating cows and 355 L day-1 in those with over 55 cows.

1,1978,Feeding behavior of lambs fed castor meal,"The experiment aimed to evaluate the feeding behavior of Santa Inês lambs fed diets containing different levels of detoxified castor meal in the concentrate. Twenty-four sheep with an average body weight of 18.5± 2.26 kg, at four months of age, were distributed in a randomized complete design with four treatment and six replications. Treatments consisted of four levels of castor meal (0, 33, 67, and 100%) replacing soybean meal. Animals underwent a 15-day adaptation period and an experimental period of 84 days. The diet was composed of 60% sugarcane silage and 40% concentrate, on a dry matter basis. Animal behavior (idle, rumination, and feeding activities) were observed visually for two 24-h periods with 5-min intervals, and recorded. The number of rumination chews and the time taken to ruminate each cud per day were counted using a digital stopwatch. Dry matter (DM) intake was not affected by inclusion of castor meal in the concentrate, averaging 884.02 g day?1. The feeding activity was not affected by addition of castor meal. Rumination time increased linearly, whereas the idle and rumination times decreased linearly with addition of castor meal. Feeding time, expressed in min per kg of DM and NDF, was not influenced by the inclusion of the meal in the diet, averaging 373.3 and 880.0 min, respectively. The number of chews and the time taken to ruminate each cud were not changed by inclusion of castor meal in the diet. Feed efficiency, expressed in grams DM and NDF per hour, was not influenced by castor meal inclusion in the diet. Rumination efficiency expressed in g DM h?1 decreased, but was not affected when expressed in g NDF h?1. Total replacement of soybean meal by castor meal in the concentrate does not affect the feeding time or feed efficiency of feedlot sheep, but leads to a small reduction of their rumination efficiency. Thus, we recommend the inclusion of castor meal in sheep diets at the levels tested in this study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18251/19033,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in dogs residents in two different environments, they are: recycling of solid waste centers (Group 1) and a neighborhood adjacent to a forest (Group 2), both in Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil and to determine epidemiological variables associated to infection in these different realities. Serum samples, randomly collected, from 61 dogs from Group 1 and from 74 dogs from Group 2 were submitted to Indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) to research for anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies. Of the 135 dogs analyzed, 13 animals (9.6%) were positive; nine (14.7%) in Group 1 and four (5.4%) in Group 2, the difference between the groups is not statistically significant. These results suggest the presence of the protozoan Leishmania spp. in both environments studied which indicate potential for infection in the human population.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22721/19028,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Biofertilizer in the nutritional quality of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.),"The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in the nutritional composition to the application of biofertilizers. The experiment was conducted with increasing doses of biofertilizers in a greenhouse at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine / UNESP, Araçatuba - Sao Paulo, Brazil, from April to October 2010. The experimental design was completely randomized with six biofertilizer doses from cattle manure (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m3 ha-1) and five replications. Cuts were performed, on average, every 27 days, 10 cm above the ground when 10% of the plants were flowering. Biofertilization had a positive significant impact on foliar nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and shoot iron concentrations. The values of crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber did not differ between doses of biofertilizers. Biofertilization is a viable alternative for nutrition of this species, showing positive results in the nutritional composition of alfalfa. However, but long-term studies are necessary to assess the environmental impact of these fertilizers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18240/19032,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Cryopreservation protocol for equine platelet-rich plasma,"In this preliminary study, a new equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) cryopreservation protocol was evaluated. PRP was obtained by a double centrifugation technique of whole blood collected from 8 adult healthy ponies. A fresh sample of PRP was analyzed for total platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet morphology. Upon morphological evaluation, 200 platelets were counted using a differential interference contrast microscope with a 40x phase objective and classified as activated (with pseudopodia), inactivated (normal discoid shape), or uncertain state (spherical shape, without pseudopodia). Two other PRP samples, one containing DMSO as a cryoprotectant and the other without DMSO, were stored in a mechanical freezer at –80ºC. After 14 days, the frozen samples were thawed and submitted to the same analysis as described above. The fresh PRP showed a platelet count of 830 (±95.3) x103 uL-1, an MPV of 5.2 (±0.07) fL, and composed of 4% activated platelets. There was no significant difference in platelet count, MPV, and activated platelets between fresh and 6% DMSO frozen PRP samples (617.9±65.5x103uL-1; 5.3±0.06fL; 9.5%) (p > 0.05). On the other hand, samples frozen without DMSO showed a significantly lower platelet count (519.6±66.1x103uL-1), higher MPV (5.7±0.08fL), and more activated platelets (13.9%) than the other groups (p < 0.05). The 6% DMSO was able to preserve platelet morphology in PRP stored at –80oC for 14 days, but studies on platelet function of thawed PRP are still needed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21777/19027,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Neospora spp. and Toxoplasma gondii infection in sheep flocks from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii are coccidian parasites (protozoa: Apicomplexa) that cause reproductive losses in ruminants. Although, in sheep, abortion is generally related to T. gondii, potential damage caused by N. caninum must be considered. The aims of this study were to evaluate the frequencies of antibodies against Neospora spp. and T. gondii, and to identify the risk factors related to neosporosis and toxoplasmosis in sheep from ten flocks located in Central-Western, Northwestern, Southwestern, and Southeastern mesoregions of the Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 300 sheep (30 per flock) and an epidemiological questionnaire was completed by the farmers. The presence of canids, felids, and rodents, the sources of water for the animals, and their reproductive history were investigated as potential epidemiological factors related to the studied infections. Serum samples were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test for the presence of antibodies against Neospora spp. (cutoff 1:50) and T. gondii (cutoff 1:64), with respective frequencies detected being 16.3% (49/300) and 41.3% (124/300). Seropositivity to both parasites was observed in 8% (24/300) of the animals. Neospora spp. and T. gondii were present in 90% (9/10) and 100% (10/10) of the flocks, respectively. The presence of cats in the pastures, pens, and barns was significantly associated (p=0.047) with high frequencies (53.3% to 70%) of antibodies against T. gondii in the flocks. However, no associations were detected (p>0.05) between each of the other risk factors and the frequency of antibodies against Neospora spp. or T. gondii. Results of this study showed a broad distribution of both protozoa in evaluated sheep flocks.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21795/19081,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Detection of Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus infection in newborn calves before colostrum intake,"The detection of Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection, especially among persistently infected calves (PI), should be performed earlier in order to eliminate the source of the infection and to prevent the spread of the disease in the herd. However, colostrum intake can influence the results of some of the tests used to diagnose the BVDV infection. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficacy of serum neutralization (SN) test in conjunction with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of BVDV infection before colostrum intake. The deliveries of the animals were assisted to select 52 newborn Holstein calves for inclusion in the study. Initially, the whole blood and serum samples were collected from the calves before (T0) and after (T1) the colostrum intake. The calves that were RT-PCR positive at any of the time-points were retested on the 30th day post birth (T2). The presence of specific antibodies for BVDV was evaluated by SN, and that of viral RNA by the RT-PCR. The BVDV-specific antibodies were observed in the serum of 13.46% (7/52) of the calves at T0 because of fetal infection. At T1, seroconversion was observed in 100% (52/52) of the calves. The geometric mean titers (GMT) of the antibodies for BVDV increased significantly from T0 (14.52) to T1 (2490) (P = 0.0001). Of the four calves that were RT-PCR positive before colostrum intake (T0), two were seronegative and two, seropositive. Of the forty-eight RT-PCR negative calves, five were seropositive. After 30 days post birth, all of the animals tested negative by RT-PCR, thus excluding the possibility of persistent infection. The association observed between the results of the SN and RT-PCR assays at T0 (P = 0.025) could not be observed at T1 (P > 0.05). The SN test before the colostrum intake allowed the detection of fetal infection in the herd; however, this test was ineffective as a diagnostic method after the transfer of passive immunity. The confirmation of the results of the SN assay by those of the RT-PCR was essential for the identification of the infected calves before colostrum intake.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21732/19078,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Mesenchymal stem cells promote augmented response of endogenous neural stem cells in spinal cord injury of rats,"Traumatic spinal cord injury results in severe neurological deficits, mostly irreversible. The cell therapy represents a strategy for treatment particularly with the use of stem cells with satisfactory results in several experimental models. The aim of the study was to compare the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) with and without mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), to investigate whether MSCs migrate and/or remain at the site of injury, and to analyze the effects of MSCs on inflammation, astrocytic reactivity and activation of endogenous stem cells. Three hours after SCI, animals received bone marrow-derived MSCs (1×107 in 1mL PBS, IV). Animals were euthanized 24 hours, 7 and 21 days post-injury. The MSC were not present in the site of the lesion and the immunofluorescent evaluation showed significant attenuation of inflammatory response with reduction in macrophages labeled with anti-CD68 antibody (ED1), decreased immunoreactivity of astrocytes (GFAP+) and greater activation of endogenous stem cells (nestin+) in the treated groups. Therefore, cell transplantation have a positive effect on recovery from traumatic spinal cord injury possibly due to the potential of MSCs to attenuate the immune response.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21596/19077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Bacteria isolated from abscesses of small ruminants inspected in the semiarid region of Brazil,"Loss in the supply chain of small ruminants owing to condemnations of carcasses in the abattoirs and slaughterhouses is common in northeastern Brazil. This study aims to identify bacterial agents, including Mycobacterium spp., in the abscesses found in the postmortem analysis of the carcasses of sheep and goats bred in northeastern Brazil. Our analysis involved 679 goats and 1,838 sheep carcasses. Abscess samples were extracted and inoculated on blood agar and Lowenstein Jensen with pyruvate or glycerol for bacterial isolation. We then performed polymerase chain reaction of the hps 65 gene; samples positive for Mycobacterium spp. were subjected to DNA sequencing. Relative frequencies of abscesses in goats and sheep were 5.44 and 3.26%, respectively. Microbiological analysis revealed 87.7% bacterial growth in the inoculated samples. Among these, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis represented 67.7% of the isolates. We observed 1.9% mycobacteria growth in the abscess samples inoculated on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. PCR of DNA extracted from abscesses samples showed amplification of 0.9% of samples. After sequencing, Mycobacterium spp. isolate was identified as M. novocastrense. C. pseudotuberculosis was the main agent responsible for the formation of abscesses in the examined animals, and we did not identify any species of the M. tuberculosis complex in the examined small ruminants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21508/18977,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Bovine mastitis: prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile and detection of genes associated with biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus,"Brazil currently ranks as one of the world leaders in food production and exportation. This scenario encourages the development of animal and plant health programs to ensure the production of safe food, helping the country to become an international provider of food for excellence. However, some health problems in dairy production, such as mastitis, have garnered increasing concern. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of bovine mastitis in select properties located in the western Santa Catarina region, to assess the susceptibility profile to antimicrobial agents used for treatment and to check for the presence of genes (icaA and icaD) associated with biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. In 148 milk samples collected, 72.97% had bacterial growth (n = 108). Among the isolated microorganisms, 21.62% (n = 32) were classified as Staphylococcus aureus, 18.91% (n = 28) as Staphylococcus sp. coagulase negative, 7.43% (n = 11) as Corynebacterium sp., 6.76% (n = 10) as Staphylococcus sp. coagulase positive, 5.41% (n = 8) as Nocardia sp. and 12.83% (n = 19) classified in different bacterial genera. Among the isolates submitted for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, it was observed that 8.95% (n = 6/67) had resistance to amoxicillin, 8.04% (n = 7/87) to ampicillin, 5.88% (n = 5/85) to cephalothin, 3.40% (n = 3/88) to ceftiofur and enrofloxacin, 20.45% (n = 18/88) to streptomycin, 17.04% (n = 15/88) to gentamicin and lincomycin, 31.81% (n = 28/88) to neomycin, 14.94% (n = 13/87) to penicillin and 25% (n = 22/88) to tetracycline. Staphylococcus sp. coagulase negative isolates showed higher multidrug resistance when compared to those of S. aureus and Staphylococcus sp. coagulase positive. Thirty-one strains of S. aureus isolates were genotypically tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), yielding a positive result for the icaA gene in 83.87% of the samples, 80.64% positive for icaD and 74.19% of these showed both genes. The results reinforce the importance of controlling this disease by adopting strict hygiene protocols and disinfection of equipment used for milking and the prescription of appropriate therapies to clinical and subclinical cases of mastitis, as well as evaluating not only the susceptibility profile of isolates but also the biofilm formation capacity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21700/18984,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica isolates in fish species captured from the Lagoa dos Patos estuary,"Microorganisms that cause human diseases can contaminate fishes in aquatic environments as well as during their capture, handling, and transport. The purpose of this study was to isolate Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica from fishes captured in the Lagoa dos Patos estuary that were eviscerated and cleaned for trade. Thirteen fish landing were analyzed and 65 entire fishes and 65 cleaned fishes were studied to determine the presence of V. parahaemolyticus and S. enterica. Bacterial isolates were compared using rep-PCR. V. parahaemolyticus was isolated from one entire Micropogonias furnieri and two entire Mugil platanus, as well as from three eviscerated M. platanus. S. enterica was isolated from two eviscerated Paralichthys orbignyanus. Identical rep-PCR bands from V. parahaemolyticus were observed in entire and eviscerated fishes from the same discharge, suggesting processing failures that neither eliminated the microorganism from the raw material nor prevented cross-contamination. S. enterica was not isolated from entire fishes, presumably because contamination occurred due to hygiene and sanitary failures. Our results showed that M. furnieri and M. platanus captured in the Lagoa dos Patos estuary may host V. parahaemolyticus and that this microorganism, as with S. enterica, may also persist even after the fish is cleaned. This is the first record of the isolation of V. parahaemolyticus from M. furnieri.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21540/18978,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Biomechanical evaluation of two extracapsular techniques for cranial cruciate ligament reconstruction in cadaver dogs,"Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) is one of the most important orthopedic conditions in dogs, leading to joint instability, pain, osteoarthritis and eventually to meniscal injuries. Several surgical techniques have been described to reestablish joint stability following CCLR, including extracapsular procedures. This study compared the biomechanical effects of two extracapsular stabilization techniques (lateral fabello-tibial suture – LFTS, and modified retinacular imbrication technique – MRIT) using nylon leader line following experimental CCLR in cadaver dogs. Twenty canine cadaveric stifles were used. Joint stiffness, cranial and caudal tibial displacement were evaluated in 4 different experimental scenarios: intact stifle, stifle with CCLR, CCLR treated with lateral fabello-tibial suture (LFTS), and CCLR treated with modified retinacular imbrication technique (MRIT). Results: Mean cranial tibial displacement increased progressively from intact to MRIT, LFTS and CCRL stifles. MRIT resulted in less caudal drawer motion than LFTS. Joint stiffness did not differ significantly between LFTS and MRIT treated stifles. Conclusion: LFTS and MRIT increase joint stability but MRIT is more effective; however none of the techniques studied was able to restore original intact stifle stiffness. Clinical implications of the results presented remain to be determined but kinetic gait analysis studies are warranted to determine whether this biomechanical advantage translates into improved hind limb function in dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21478/18976,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Barbatiman and chitosan creams as adjuvants in rabbit skin wound healing,"In this study, 5% barbatiman and 5% chitosan creams were evaluated as adjuvants in the tissue repair process by secondary intention of rabbit’s skin wounds. Four equidistant wounds were induced in the dorsal skin of 20 adult male rabbits, which were submitted to healing by secondary intention and treated with 5% chitosan cream (QC, n=5), 5% barbatiman cream (BC, n=5), 2% allantoin cream (n=5), and base cream (n=5). The creams were applied with the aid of disposable spatulas after washing the wounds. The wounds were daily analyzed by clinical examination for 21 days and histological analyses were performed on the 3rd, 14th, and 21st day after induction. The microscopic evaluation of the wounds of all groups showed macroscopic features of the healing process at different time intervals. The QC and BC treatments helped in the skin repair process in rabbits when compared to the other two treatments. They induced fibroblast activation and early collagen deposition, and modulated re-epithelialization and neovascularization. Thus, it was concluded that BC and QC are efficient and economically feasible as adjuvants in the healing process of skin wounds in rabbits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21276/18975,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Weight gain, behavioral and cortisol changes after orchiectomy with or without local anaesthesia in piglets","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intratesticular local anesthesia on weight gain and behavioral and cortisol changes in piglets submitted to castration. Study design was a randomized controlled trial. Twenty-nine male Landrace crossbred piglets aged 3 to 6 days were used. The piglets were randomly divided into two groups: orchiectomy with anesthesia (A, n = 15) and orchiectomy without anesthesia (NOA, n = 14). Piglets in the A and NOA groups were treated with 0.5 mL of intratesticular 2% lidocaine with a vasoconstrictor in each testicle and 0.5 mL of intratesticular 0.9% sodium chloride, respectively. Blood samples were collected from all animals immediately after surgery and at 3 and 6 days postoperatively for measurement of the serum cortisol concentration. Behavior was assessed daily for 6 days by two observers blinded to the treatment. Weight was measured at the same time as cortisol measurement. Analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to investigate differences in time within and between the two groups. Mean times of six evaluations done for 90 minutes during 6 days of each behavior were compared by Tukey t test. The level of statistical significance was 5%. The serum cortisol concentration was higher immediately after surgery than at 3 and 6 days postoperatively in both groups. Weight gain was greater at 3 and 6 days postoperatively in the A group than in the NOA group. Intratesticular local anesthesia before castration in piglets is technically practical, is in accordance with good welfare practice, and improves short-term weight gain in piglets submitted to castration.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21241/19435,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Physicochemical properties and enzymatic bean grains dried at different temperatures and stored for 225 days,"Beans are an important food in the world and are present on the tables of Brazilians almost daily. The harvest of these grains occurs seasonally during the year, and hence, steps after harvesting are essential to maintain product demand. However, the drying and storage conditions may alter the characteristics of the beans, reducing their economic value and their acceptability to consumers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of storage time on the chemical, technological and enzymatic parameters of black beans dried at three temperatures (30, 45 and 60 °C) and stored for 225 days in conventional woven polypropylene bags. The results show that the increase in storage time leads to a lower protein solubility, and a decreased content of tannins, lipids and proteins; and an increased cooking time, fat acidity, and the enzymatic activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. These parameters are important in the quality control of beans for consumption and as a raw material for the food industry. The quantity of broken grains and the grain roughness index are only influenced by the drying temperature regardless of the storage time of 225 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21647/19053,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Partial substitution of sodium chloride in Toscana sausages and the effect on product characteristics,"High sodium intake has been linked with problems of hypertension and in Brazil, it still has above that recommended by the World Health Organization. Meat products contribute 20–30% of sodium intake in the diet, indicating the necessity of reducing the amount of sodium added. The aim of this study was to reduce the sodium content in Toscana sausages by partial replacement of sodium chloride with PuraQ Arome NA4 substitute, and to evaluate the effect on physico-chemical and microbiological parameters and sensory acceptability. Three formulations – one control (T1), and one with 20% (T2) and another with 30% (T3) sodium reduction compared with the control – were produced. For comparative purposes, the physico-chemical, microbiological and sensory parameters were determined. In the proposed formulations with 20% and 30% reduction, the sodium contents were 857.3 mg 100 g-1 (T2) and 790.3 mg 100 g-1 (T3), compared with 926.7 mg 100 g-1 in T1. The produced samples were in accordance with the physico-chemical (moisture, lipid, protein and calcium) and microbiological (Salmonella, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, and sulphite-reducing Clostridium and Coliforms at 45°C) parameters stipulated by Brazilian law. The analysis of lightness and hue indicated that the sample T3 had a more intense red colour, while T1 had a less intense red colour. In the shear force evaluation, no difference was observed between the samples. The sample T2 was the most preferred in the ordering of preference test; however, in the hedonic scale, there was no difference between the means of sensory values for roast colour, aroma, texture, flavour and overall impression, indicating that all samples had adequate sensory acceptance. Acceptability levels were greater than 74.6% for all attributes evaluated in T1, T2 and T3.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20968/18971,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Rates of nitrogen from nitric and ammoniacal sources required by upland rice genotypes originating from Brazil and Colombia,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial growth, nitrogen (N) uptake, and agronomic efficiency after the use of N fertilizers in upland rice cultivation. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse by using pots filled with surface-layer (0 to 20 cm) soil collected from the municipality of Jaguapitã, Paraná. The experimental design was completely randomized with 4 replications. A factorial scheme of 5 × 2 was used, in which the factors were 5 N rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 kg ha-1 N) and 2 cultivars of rice (Fedearroz Lagunas [Colombian] and IAPAR- 9 [Brazilian]). The N sources tested were ammonium sulfate (Experiment I) and calcium nitrate (Experiment II). The following variables were evaluated: number of tillers per pot (NTP), dry mass of the shoots (DMS), N content in the dry mass (NCDM), and agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer (AEN). The data obtained in the experiments were evaluated using analysis of variance, and mean values were compared using Tukey’s test at 5% significance for rice cultivar effects or adjusted to polynomial regression equations for N rates. Use of calcium nitrate yielded higher values of NTP, NCDM, and AEN. The cultivar Lagunas showed higher NTP, while IAPAR-9 showed higher DMS. An increase in N rates, for both sources, resulted in the increase of NTP, DMS, and NCDM; however, AEN was decreased.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22887/18969,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,Nutritional and biochemical changes induced by lead in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.),"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of increasing concentrations of lead (Pb) in the nutrient solution on growth and macronutrient and organic solute contents of Helianthus annuus plants. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. The dry mass yield was not affected by the treatments up to a Pb concentration of 0.6 mM, indicating that H. annuus was tolerant to this Pb concentration in the growth medium. The reductions in leaf, stem and root dry masses at a Pb concentration of 0.8 mM were 74, 84 and 85%, respectively. Lead stress did not reduce the levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), indicating that the growth reduction observed at 0.8 mM Pb could not be attributed to deficiencies of these nutrients. On the other hand, Pb significantly reduced calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) contents in leaves, stems and roots, which might, at least in part, explain the Pb-induced growth reduction in the H. annuus plants. Pb increased soluble carbohydrate, free amino acid and proline contents in leaves, and soluble protein and proline contents in roots, showing stress-induced changes in cell metabolism. The data also suggest that Ca and Mg concentrations may be used as nutritional indicators and the proline content may be used as a biochemical indicator of Pb toxicity in H. annuus.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21670/18966,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,High gamma irradiation doses and long storage times reduce soybean seed quality,"High quality seeds are required for soybean production. This study evaluated the effect of gamma irradiation and storage time on seed quality in soybean lines VX04-6828 and VX04-5692. Seeds were gamma irradiated (60Co) with 0, 50, 150, and 250 Gy. After the first seed production cycle (M1), the harvested seeds were stored in the laboratory for 0, 2, 4, and 6 months. Moisture content, seed quality (germination rate, dead seeds, and normal and abnormal seedlings), and seed vigor (first germination count, germination index, and seedling length) were determined. Data were submitted to analysis of variance for each soybean line using a 4 x 4 factorial design (four storage times x four gamma irradiation doses). Response surfaces were constructed based on the F test significance (p ? 0.05). VX04-5692 seeds were more sensitive to gamma radiation than were VX04-6828 seeds. Soybean seed quality was highest in M2 seeds derived from seeds irradiated with less than 100 Gy and stored for up to two months. High gamma irradiation doses and long storage times reduced soybean seed quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21658/18965,E-ISSN 1679-0359
1,1978,"Physiological, biochemical, and nutritional parameters of wheat treated with a fungicide and foliar fertilizer","Agronomic improvements in grain yield and quality of wheat crops could be obtained through the application of strategies, such as using foliar fungicides with fertilizers, to protect the leaves against pathogens and delay senescence during grain filling. However, few studies have reported the effect of these practices on wheat, although these treatments could represent a new method of increasing wheat production and profits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of foliar fertilizer, applied alone or in combination with a fungicide, on the photochemical, biochemical, and nutritional parameters of wheat plants. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions in a 2 × 3 factorial design (fungicide × foliar fertilizer) with four replications. The fungicide treatment used was azoxystrobin + cyproconazole + mineral oil; the control was left untreated. The foliar fertilizer was used at two different rates, and the control was not treated. Plants were sprayed at the GS29/GS30, GS45, and GS60 growth stages, and the plants were assessed ten days after the last spray. Chlorophyll a fluorescence, the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and electron transport rate were positively influenced by fertilizer. Fertilizer spraying significantly increased the leaf pigment content (chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids) and the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentration in flag leaves. When used in mixture, the fertilizer mitigates the stresses generated by the fungicide.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21672/18967,E-ISSN 1679-0359
