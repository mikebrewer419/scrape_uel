29,2008,Commercial characterization of ‘Londrina’carrot roots on six cycles of selectionCommercial characterization of ‘Londrina’carrot roots on six cycles of selection,"Carrot is a crop for mild climate but after development of cultivars with heat tolerance, it is cultivate in Brazil during all year long. However, factors as: temperature, relative air humidity, photoperiod, harvest time and consumers preference must be observed at the moment of correct cultivar choice for each region and sowing season. This work was carried out to observe commercial parameters and root production from six selection cycles of Londrina cultivar, comparing them to Brasíla cultivar with the purpose of obtaining informations about the cultivars used by carrot growers in Londrina county-PR. The research was set up at the campus of Universidade Estadual de Londrina, since February till June, 2003. There evaluations were done about flowering characteristics (%), coloration, length, diameter, shape, fresh mass and root yield. Experimental design was randomized blocks, with seven treatments and five replications. The plants obtained after six selection cycles of ‘Londrina’ carrot produced roots with commercial characteristics for coloring, length, diameter and shape, complying consumers demand, similar to that Brasília cultivar, showing to be a promising selectionl to introduce on national market as a cultivar, indicated for regions with similar local characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2762/4941,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Those eight treatments were arranged in a randomized experimental block design, with four replications. The highest heights of plant (176.9 cm) and of first ear (83.9 cm) were from those with no hilling (SA) and the smallest ones (162.4 and 72.9 cm, respectively) were from those with hilling on 28 DAS. The greatest yield of ears (56,000 ears ha-1) was obtained from 14-28-42 DAS treatments and the smallest one was from SA (47,000 ears ha-1). The greatest yield of non commercial ears (15,000 ears ha-1) was obtained from 14-42 and 14-28-42 DAS treatments and the smallest one was from SA (7,000 ears ha-1). Yield of commercial ears varied from 38,000 ears ha-1, on 28 DAS treatment to 41,000 ears ha-1, on 14, 42, 28-42 and 14-28-42 DAS treatments. Costs of yield varied from R$ 1,315.90 ha-1, in SA treatment, to R$ 1,774.17 ha-1, with hilling on 14-28-42 DAS. The greatest net income was R$ 2,684.10 ha-1 with no hilling and the smallest was R$ 2,166.81 ha-1 with hilling on 14-42 DAS. In the conditions that the experiment was carried out it was concluded that the cultivation with no hilling is recommended because it showed the smallest yield cost and the greatest net income.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2656/2309,E-ISSN 1679-0359

29,2008,Composition of phenolic acids content in apple (Malus sp) pomace,"The present work aimed the study of phenolic acids composition in apple pomace of Gala and Fuji cultivars. Phenolic acids were fractionated in phenolic acids, esterified and insoluble and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sixteen phenolic acids were identified in apple pomace samples. Total phenolic acids in apple pomace from Gala and Fuji cultivars were, in dry weight, 93.94 mg/ g and 68.38 mg/g, respectively. Content of free phenolic acids in apple pomace from Gala cultivar was 29.11 mg/g and the following acids were identified: salicylic, protocatequinic, quinic, p-coumaric, gallic, propylgallate and synapic. Content of free phenolic acids in apple pomace from Fuji cultivar was 16.03 mg/g and the following acids were identified: salicylic, protocatequinic, gallic, ferulic and sinapic. Salicylic was the predominant free phenolic acids found in both cultivars, consisting of 91.67% and 63.57% of the free phenolic acids in Gala and Fuji cultivars, respectively. Chlorogenic acid (1.147 mg/g) was found only in apple pomace from Fuji cultivar. Content of esterified phenolic acids in apple pomace from Gala and Fuji cultivars were 53.75 mg/g and 48.29 mg/g, respectively. It was verified that the predominant esterified phenolic acid in pomace from apple Gala is derived from salicylic acid (52.76 mg/g). Acids derived from gallic acid (0.175 mg/g), propylgallate acid (0.198 mg/g), ferulic acid (0.159 mg/g) and sinapic acid (0.140 mg/g) were also found in Gala cultivar. Regarding to pomace from cultivar Fuji, the main esterified phenolic acid found is also derived from salicylic acid (47.42 mg/g) followed by gallic acid (0.270 mg/g), benzoic acid (0.194 mg/g) and sinapic acid (0.115 mg/g). Content of insoluble phenolic acids in apple pomace from Gala and Fugi cultivars were, in dry weight, 11.08 mg/g and 4.05 mg/g, respectively. Insoluble phenolic acids derived from salicylic acid were found in higher concentrations in apple pomace from both cultivars.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2825/2401,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The objective was to demonstrate that the continuous and holistic application of a technology transfer system may speed up the awareness and the adoption of these technologies by the farmers and result in positive outcomes for all actors and institutions involved in the process. The methodology of technology transfer analyzed, the T&V System, is already used by Embrapa Soybean, a branch of Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation – EMBRAPA, Rural Extension and Technical Assistance Corporation - EMATER, Agronomic institute of Parana - IAPAR and Cooperative Organization of Parana – OCEPAR as partners. It was concluded that the T&V System may be an important tool for improvement of the validation and transfer of technologies generated by research institutions. In the COPACOL, the T&V contributed with the technological development of the technicians and farmers. It contributed also, with the growth of the profit obtained by the farmers who participated of the T&V as compared with the average growth obtained by the other farmers, members of the cooperative. Finally, it was observed that the time of adoption of new technologies was decreased with the application of the T&V System.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2811/2391,E-ISSN 1679-0359

However the estimation of genetic parameters related to seed physiologic quality has been little explored and works of that are scarec in the literature. The objective in this work was to estimate genetic parameters for seed physiologic quality of three soybean cultivars and fourteen lineages, with late maturation cycle, that are part of five final experiments of lineages evaluation from the Program of Genetic Improvement of Soybean of the Department of Fitotecnia of UFV, led in Tupaciguara, Florestal, Unaí and two places in Capinopolis, state of Minas Gerais, in the agricultural year 2000/2001. The experimental design was random blocks, with three repetitions. The genetic parameters estimates were quadratic genotypic component, genotype x environments variance component, genotypic determination coefficient and genetic variation coefficient. The seeds physiologic quality was evaluated by germination test and seedling emergence on sand substrate. The seeds of cultivars FT 104, Doko-RC, Conquista and of lineages UFV97-61190916, UFV98-CR67 had germination over 85% in all the environmentsl. The genotypic determination coefficients based on seed germination and seedling emergence varied among the environments. The individual selection of soybean genotypes, based on the seed physiologic quality by locality, can lead to higher gains than joint selection considering all environments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/5448/10257,E-ISSN 1679-0359

32,2011,"Assessment of microbiological, physico-chemical and enzymatic parameters of pasteurized Milk and type B, produced in Paraná, Brazil","In 2006, Paraná State produced 2,7 billion liters of milk. Despite the great production, in general, milk is still produced under poor hygienic and sanitary conditions, which leads to an elevated number of microorganisms that reduce the quality and represent risk to consumer’s health, particularly when consumed without heat treatments. As a result, quality was the focus in the PNMQL (National Plan for the Improvement of Milk Quality), that created the Normative Instruction 51(IN 51), which determines important standards to improve milk quality. Therefore this work aimed to evaluate microbiological and physical-chemical quality of pasteurized milk in different municipal districts of Parana State between 2006 and 2008, years that follow IN 51 implementation. Milk samples from 39 different dairy industries were analyzed, adding up to 192 samples. From those, 70 milk samples were classified as type B pasteurized and the 122 samples was classified as pasteurized milk. Within the 192 analyzed samples of milk 58 (47,54%), 17 (13,93%) and 29 (23,77%) presented results above legal limits for coliforms at 30°C, coliforms at 45°C and mesophilic aerobes, respectively. While to type B milk samples results above legal limits found were 23 (18,85%), 4 (3,28%) and 6 (8,57%) for coliforms at 30°C, coliforms at 45°C and mesophilic aerobes. In regard to the analyses of dornic acidity, fat percentage, densidade, dry fat free extrat and crioscopy the results outside legal standards were 33 (17,19%), 14 (7,29%), 7 (3,65%), 35 (18,21%) and 30(15,63%), respectively.It can be concluded from this work that type B milk presented better microbiological quality than pasteurized milk. The most frequent microbiological alterations were observed for the Coliforms 30ºC analysis of pasteurized milk, for type B milk the higher counts were obtained for mesophilic aerobes. There was an improvement in quality in the two types of milk analyzed over the years that followed IN 51 implementation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/5385/8926,E-ISSN 1679-0359

31,2010,Evaluation of halothane as stressor agent in poultry,"Studies have been demonstrating in poultry, the existence of at least two causes for the formation of PSE meat: genetic through the sensibility towards halothane and the environmental factor in particular the temperature as the main factor. Thus the objective of this work was to evaluate halothane as stressor agent for broiler concomitantly to evaluating the PSE incidence by submitting these birds to thermal stress. In this experiment, 24 broilers of commercial lineage were divided in 6 animals for 4 treatments: HHH, broilers submitted to halothane test and slaughtered 1h after this test; HET broilers submitted to halothane at 35°C/1h after 48h of halothane test followed by the birds slaughtering; EET, broilers submitted to thermal stress and slaughtered immediately after this treatment, and finally the control treatment (CCC) where broilers were not submitted to halothane test nor to thermal stress as control.

30,2009,Physico-chemical and chemical quality of acerola fruit clones coated with PVC film and conserved under refrigeration,"This work aimed to evaluate the physical, physicochemical and chemical changes in fruits of clones of acerola coated with PVC film and conserved under refrigeration. The clones BRS 235 (Apodi), BRS 236 (Cereja), BRS 237 (Roxinha), BRS 238 (Frutacor), II 47/1 and BRS 152 (Sertaneja) had been harvested in the stage of commercial maturation. The fruits had been washed in chlorinated water, packed in expanded polystyrene trays, covered with film PVC and stored (10ºC) during 12 days, with withdrawals of samples at the beginning of the experiment and to each three days. They had been evaluated: coloration, soluble solids, titratable acidity, soluble solids:titratable acidity relation, pH, soluble sugars, vitamin C, anthocyanins, weight lost, firmness and carotenoids. The experiment was carried through in experimental delineation completely randomized in factorial design (clones x time), with 3 repetitions (trays with 100g of fruits). Between the clones studied the II47/1 if it detached for the relative stability of the color, angle hue, and of anthocyanins, being more attractive for the consumer in the time of the purchase. However the clones Roxinha and Sertaneja had presented superior soluble solids:titratable acidity between the others in the end of the experiment, interesting characteristic for the flavor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/4082/3633,E-ISSN 1679-0359

We conducted a soil collected in March (rainy season) and another in September 2009 (dry season) at a depth of 00-10 cm and 10-20 cm for microbiological analysis. The data of microbiology and soil were analyzed descriptively through the estimation of the mean and standard deviation and also by multivariate analysis, estimating the average Euclidean distance between treatments, with complete linkage. There are training groups between organic management without soil disturbance and the remaining area of Cerrado indicating proximity between attributes. The area under conventional conditions with burns presents the highest values of respiration and metabolic quotient indicating stress solo. O organic management system without tilling the soil shows levels of microbial biomass nitrogen higher than the other managements and the remaining area of Cerrado.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/10629/13045,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Resumption of cyclic ovarian activity in postpartum ewes: a review,"The reproduction rate is considered a crucial factor that affects the ability of producers to meet the growing demand for ovines meat, and optimizing this factor will maximize the production rate and increase the efficiency of livestock. A reduction in the length of the postpartum anestrus period results in a shorter interval between lambing and conception and enables more lambs to be produced throughout the life of a ewe. This review discusses the current knowledge of several factors associated with the resumption of cyclic ovarian function in postpartum ewes and how the suckling management of ewes may affect this process. Factors that influence the resumption of cyclic ovarian activity include uterine involution, follicular development, occurrence of silent ovulation and short estrous cycles, breed, reproductive seasonality, nutrition and lactation. Controlled suckling and early weaning are management practices that may be used to obtain three lambings in a 24-month period. In the majority of the studies the interval between lambing and first estrus was reduced when a controlled suckling management strategy was used, therefore the controlled suckling appears to be the best alternative because it has produced good results and is easy to implement. Currently, however, this practice is still not widely used.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20956/18779,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Concentration of minerals in the hoof horny capsule of healthy and lame dairy cows,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the mineral concentrations in the hoof horny capsule of healthy Holstein cows and cows with hoof problems associated with laminitis. Twenty-one multiparous Holstein cows with an average production of 24 L of milk/day, reared with semi-extensive nutritional management, were studied. The animals were evaluated and divided into two groups based on their locomotion score (LS, range: 0 to 4). LS greater than 2 indicated laminitis-associated lesions (lame cow group: LC), and LS = 0 indicated cows without laminitis (CWL). A sample of 30 mm2 was collected from the hoof horny capsule at the abaxial wall to evaluate the concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium. Calcium blood concentration was also evaluated. The LC group had lower magnesium concentration (P=0.008) and showed a trend (P=0.06) for lower calcium concentration compared to healthy animals (CWL), even though all animals were normocalcemic. The concentration of other minerals did not differ between the LC and CWL group. In conclusion, the magnesium concentration in the hoof horny capsule was lower in cows with lesions associated with laminitis, while phosphorus and zinc concentrations were not affected. The relationship between hoof lesions and calcium concentration requires further investigation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20436/19030,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Therefore, since 2001, the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT) is being implemented in all Federative Units of Brazil, based on the compulsory vaccination of bovine females, control of animal movement and certification of brucellosis-free herds. This review covers the current epidemiological situation of bovine brucellosis in Brazil, issues related to public health and economic importance, as well as Brazilian initiatives to control the disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22612/19477,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Oxidative stress in dogs,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), also known as free radicals, are generated during cellular respiration. Under normal conditions, the body has the ability to neutralize the effects of free radicals by using its antioxidant defenses. In the case of an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, free radical production exceeds the capacity of organic combustion, resulting in oxidative stress. Of all the cellular components compromised by the harmful effects of ROS, the cell membrane is the most severely affected owing to lipid peroxidation, which invariably leads to changes in the membrane structure and permeability. With lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, some by-products can be detected and measured in tissues, blood, and other bodily fluids. The measurement of biomarkers of oxidative stress is commonly used to quantify lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane in humans, a species in which ROS can be considered as a cause or consequence of oxidative stress-related diseases. In dogs, few studies have demonstrated this correlation. The present review aims to identify current literature knowledge relating to oxidative stress diseases and their detection in dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21723/19031,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Plants that cause photosensitivity in ruminants in Brazil,"This study aimed to review the mechanisms of action, clinical signs, pathology, and toxic compounds of plants that cause photosensitivity in ruminants. In addition, we sought to clarify the diagnostic methods and prophylaxis of photosensitivity-induced plants. Photosensitizing plants constitute an important group of poisonous plants in Brazil and there are at least seventeen species distributed in nine genera. Some of these plants have well known toxic compounds; in others, the substance responsible for the disease is unknown. In general, the photosensitivity can be classified as primary or secondary. Among the plants causing primary photosensitivity in Brazil, Ammi majus contains furocoumarins, while the compound in Froelichia humboldtiana remains uncertain. The known toxic compounds causing secondary photosensitivity include pyrrolizidine alkaloids, furans sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, and steroidal saponins. In other plants causing secondary photosensitization, including Stryphnodendron spp. and Enterolobium spp., the toxic compound is still unknown. Future research should be conducted in order to determine the various mechanisms of action of each toxic compound to assist the diagnosis of photosensitivity, to develop less toxic or non-toxic cultivars, or even to find new ways of preventing photosensitization.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22386/19446,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Guaiaca – a software tool for supporting the use of scientific applications designed for data analysis – part I: execution assistant,"The aim of this work is to develop a software tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface of generic and configurable design in order to ease the researcher’s tasks in data manipulation and analysis. Two primary targets have influenced the design: data preparation for analysis in animal breeding programs and usability increase for those applications that perform important analysis methods, but interact with users only through text files and command lines. The Guaiaca tool was designed as a “utility belt” in the form of two integrated assistants, and it can be combined with multiple analysis applications. This tool offers facilities to: (a) collect, manipulate, and reorganize data; (b) organize, register, and retrieve analyses through descriptors; and (c) prepare and activate analysis processes. Guaiaca’s Execution Assistant module is described in this paper, where is also emphasized the parameters to configure, the main data structures to maintain, and the form of the relationship between its generic interface and combined analysis applications. The generic interface has been customized and validated for the peculiarities of two applications, WOMBAT (mixed models) and INTERGEN (Bayesian models). Several data analyses were performed with the interface support to prove its generality and ease of installation, configuration and operation. Data sets from 5,726 quails in a breeding program were used with these applications. Use of the integrated Guaiaca-WOMBAT application is illustrated with an analysis example, prepared and visualized on the Guaiaca tool and executed by WOMBAT. The Beta version of the Guaiaca tool for Windows is available free of charge to the scientific community and can be obtained at http://www.ufpel.edu.br/~gil.medeiros/guaiaca.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21878/19467,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Isolation of dermatophytes from 50 asymptomatic domestic cats treated at the Federal University of Mato Grosso Veterinary – Hospital in Cuiabá, MT","Dermatophytosis, commonly known as ringworm, is a zoonotic disease caused by complex fungi that grow as hyphae and attach to the skin, hair and nails or claws. About 40 species of fungi of the genera Microsporum spp., Trichophyton spp. and Epidermophyton spp. are considered dermatophytes, and Microsporum canis is the genus most commonly isolated from cats. This study investigated the occurrence of dermatophytes in cats without clinical signs of skin diseases. The study involved the physical examination of 50 clinically healthy cats and the collection of samples for direct examination and fungal culture at a university veterinary hospital. The resulting data were evaluated by the chi-square association test. Of the 50 cats, 11 (22%) presented dermatophytes, with a predominance of Microsporum spp. The other 39 animals were diagnosed for non-dermatophytic fungi. Sex, breed and the presence of contactants showed no statistical difference, although there was a predominance of adult animals. The high dermatophyte infection rate confirms that cats without clinical signs can harbor these fungi, acting as asymptomatic carriers, contaminating the environment and increasing the infection rate. This study confirms that cats without clinical signs can be carriers of ringworm, which underscores the importance of the adoption of control methods even for clinically healthy animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21824/19445,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,In vitro efficacy of teat antiseptics against Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from bovine mastitis,"The process of teat disinfection is a widely accepted component of successful mastitis control programs by reducing the number of bacteria on the teat skin and healing teat lesions. For contagious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, post-milking teat disinfection remains a simple, effective and economical practice for prevention of new intramammary infections (IMIs) of lactating dairy cows. Despite the universal acceptance of teat dipping as a method of mastitis control, variations in the susceptibility and resistance profile of mastitis pathogens among antiseptics have been described. Thus, here we sought to explore the in vitro efficacy of the followings antiseptics against S. aureus isolated from IMIs: chlorhexidine (2.0%), chlorine (2.5%), quarternary ammonium (4.0%), lactic acid (2.0%) and iodine (0.6%). We used 50 S. aureus strains isolated from bovine IMIs from 50 dairy herds located at Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul States (Brazil). The antiseptics were evaluated at four different specific intervals (15, 30, 60 and 300 s). We found a higher activity for quarternary ammonium and chlorhexidine against S. aureus at all time-points, followed by iodine and then chlorine. Lactic acid treatment produced the worst results for all time-points and strains. Due to variations in the sensitivity and resistance profile of antiseptics against S. aureus isolated from IMIs, the effectiveness of the antiseptics against the major mastitis pathogens should be periodically evaluated in dairy farms in an attempt to reduce the rate of new IMIs in the herd.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21597/19639,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of ozonation on the Staphylococcus Aureus innoculated in milk,"The aim of this research was evaluate the efficiency of the action of ozonation of milk on the reduction of the bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus artificially inoculated and subjected to different binomials times/concentrations of ozone. The samples were divided in four assays: 1 and 2, with skim milk and ozone concentrations of 34.7 mg L –1 and 44.8 mg L-1, respectively, and assays 3 and 4, with whole milk and the same concentrations of ozone. The time of ozonation in all of the assays was 5 (T1), 10 (T2), 15 (T3), 20 (T4) and 25 (T5) minutes. Each treatment was replicated three times. The bacterial counts were determined immediately before and after the ozonation process by plating the samples on Baird Parker agar. In treatments 1 and 2, the greatest reductions were 0.42 log10 CFU/mL (colony forming units per millilitre), whereas in treatments 3 and 4, the greatest reductions were 0.19 and 0.21 log10 CFU/mL, respectively. The results of all of the tests show that, for T1, there was no reduction in the microbial load, whereas for T2, there was a sharp decrease in the microbiota, and this decrease was even more significant for T4 and T5. In both skim and whole milk with ozone concentrations of 34.7 and 44.8 mg L-1, the reductions were significantly greater after 20 minutes of ozonation. The results indicated that ozone showed low efficacy in the reduction of S.aureus inoculated into fluid milk and milk fat interferes with the bactericidal action of the gas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21805/19637,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Ingestive behavior of sheep fed Brazil nut cake in the diet,"This study evaluated the ingestive behavior of sheep when fed a corn-silage-based diet with varying levels (0%, 15%, 30%, and 60%) of Brazil nut cake (NC) (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.). Sixteen mongrel sheep with an average weight of 33 ± 6.04 kg were randomly distributed between four treatments. Data were tested for assumptions of normality, subjected to an analysis of variance, and adjusted in regression equations and by Williams’ test, to estimate the W point. The voluntary intake of dry matter (DM) and insoluble neutral detergent fiber (NDF) decreased linearly (P = 0.013 and P = 0.002) by 5.0 g and 2.41 g d-1, respectively, for every 1% of NC added to the diet. The time the animals spent feeding (288.75 min d-1) was not significantly affected; time spent idle increased linearly (P= 0.0002) by 3.10 min, and time spent during rumination decreased linearly by 2.62 min (P = 0.001) for each 1% addition of the co-product. The number of ruminated boluses (NRB) displayed a decreasing effect (P = 0.004) of 4.61 d-1 for each 1% of NC. For ruminating chews, the time spent per bolus (37.5 sec) and the number per bolus (56.14) did not differ (P > 0.05) between treatments. However, the total chewing time (TCT) decreased linearly (P = 0.002) by 0.05 h d-1 and the number of chews per day displayed a quadratic effect (P = 0.008), with a maximum value estimated at 17.5% of NC in the diet. Rumination efficiency did not differ between the treatments (101.95 g DM h-1 and 36.76 g NDF h-1). The feeding efficiency (FE) had a linear reduction (P = 0.045) of 0.42 g NDF h-1, but was similar for g DM h-1 (172.5). The daily intake of DM and NDF showed W points estimated at 51.96% and 30.67% NC, respectively. The variables NRB, TCT, and FE (g NDF h-1) had W points estimated at 56.64%, 56.19%, and 56.33% NC, respectively. The Brazil nut cake, when present at levels greater than 56% of the diet’s DM, affects the ingestive behavior of the animals, particularly rumination-related variables, and at levels of 30.67%, it begins to affect the consumption of NDF, primarily due to the ether extract content and the diet’s fiber source.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22474/19466,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Effect of agaricus blazei in the diet of broiler chickens on immunity, serum parameters and antioxidant activity","The effect of adding Agaricus blazei to the diet of broilers on immunity, serum parameters, and antioxidant activity was evaluated. A total of 840 1-day-old chicks were used, distributed among five levels of a completely randomized design (0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20% A. blazei), with six replications and 28 birds per experimental unit. The weights of the thymus, spleen and cloacal bursa were not influenced (P > 0.05). Leukocytes, macrophages and nitric oxide were unaffected (P > 0.05), but at each supplementation level compared with the control, differences appeared in the percentages of eosinophils and macrophages (P < 0.05) at inclusion levels of 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20%. At 28 days, the antibody titer against Newcastle disease showed a quadratic response (P < 0.05) with supplementation, and from the estimated level of 0.08% the production of antibodies was stimulated; however, the same behavior was not observed (P > 0.05) at 42 days. Hypocholesterolemic effect was demonstrated (P < 0.05), but the serum triglyceride concentration was not affected (P > 0.05). The antioxidant activity of mushroom showed a positive linear effect (P < 0.05) on DPPH capture on day zero of meat cooling. The inclusion of A. blazei in the diet of broilers provided an immunostimulatory activity and hypocholesterolemic effect. Residual compounds with antioxidant activity were present in the meat, which may promote tissue protection of the animal in vivo, making possible the use of A. blazei as a natural additive.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22447/19480,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Anti-nutritional potential of protodioscin and kinetics of degradation in Urochloa grasses,"This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional value of Urochloa exotic grasses to quantify aspects of anti-quality and to identify their correlation with quality grasses. We evaluated the grasses U. humidicola cv. Comum, U. humidicola cv. BRS Tupi, U. decumbens cv. Basilisk, D70 U. decumbens and U. ruziziensis ecotype R124, and we grouped them into summer, autumn, winter and spring. We determined the chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, levels of protodioscin and cumulative gas production from the leaves of grass materials in nature. Basilisk and D70 showed higher content protodioscin in all seasons, with the highest values (31.4 and 27.4 g kg-1, respectively) in spring. D70 had a crude protein content of 140.0 g kg-1 in summer and a better in vitro digestibility of dry matter (888.7 g kg-1). R124 had a higher cumulative gas production in the spring (16.44 mL gas 100 mg DM-1). U. humidicola (Comum and BRS Tupi) presented lower protodioscin concentrations (1.22 and 1.07 g kg DM-1, respectively), and U. decumbens (Basilisk and D70) presented higher concentrations (27.25 and 24.55 g kg DM-1, respectively). The presence of protodioscin interfered with in vitro digestibility results and cumulative gas production in vitro.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22463/19479,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,"The quality of lipid ingredients for pig diets: effects on performance, carcass and meat traits and adipocyte diameter","This study aimed to evaluate the viability of using four lipid products (refined soybean oil, RO; degummed soybean oil, DO; pig lard, PL; and recycled frying oil, FO) as ingredients for pig feed during the finishing phase. The products were previously evaluated for the presence of insoluble impurities, peroxide levels, and total acidity as well as dioxin group, polychlorinated biphenyl, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants. Eighty 110 day-old pigs, including 40 castrated males and 40 females, with a mean initial weight of 59.01 ± 5.09 kg, were subjected to four treatments (feed containing RO, DO, PL, and FO) for 32 days to evaluate the effect on growth performance, carcass and meat traits and adipocyte diameter. The results for the products did not reveal any degradation or presence of contaminants within the use restriction levels. There were no differences regarding performance, carcass and meat traits, and adipocyte diameter among the treatments. The animals fed FO feed exhibited a poorer loin area and marbling (P < 0.07).

37,2016,Performance and intestinal health of weanling pigs fed with dietary nucleotides,"Previous studies reported benefits to growth performance, intestinal histology and reduced diarrhea for pigs supplemented with nucleotide additive as a replacement to antimicrobial growth promoters. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nucleotide levels on performance, occurrence of diarrhea, relative weight of organs, intestinal histology, and intestinal microbiota of weanling pigs. One hundred and sixty 21-d weaned pigs (6.43 ± 0.71 kg BW) were used in a randomized complete block design experiment with five treatments, eight replications per treatment and four animals per pen (experimental unit). The treatments were basal diet with 120 ppm of chloro-hydroxyquinoline (antimicrobial), and basal diet with 0 (control), 100, 150, or 200 ppm of nucleotides. The average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), gain to feed ratio (G:F), and occurrence of diarrhea were calculated from day 1 to 14, day 14 to 34, and day 1 to 34 of the experiment. A day after the end of the experiment, one animal from each pen was slaughtered to evaluate the relative weight of organs, intestinal histology, and intestinal microbiota. From day 1-14 and day 14-34 of the experiment, performance was not affected by the treatments. For the total experimental period (day 1-34), increasing the dietary concentrations of nucleotides linearly improved the final body weight and average daily gain. Salmonella spp. was detected only in the control treatment, without affecting the other microorganisms. Pigs fed with antibiotic had a lower occurrence of diarrhea from day 1-14 compared to pigs fed with nucleotide treatments. Although increasing the occurrence of diarrhea in the first 14 days, dietary nucleotides added up to 200 ppm, improve the final body weight and average daily gain at 34 days post weaning. Nucleotides and antimicrobial not shown beneficial effects on organ weights, and intestinal histology of nursery pig, however, are able to decrease the population of Salmonella spp. at small intestine.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22358/19642,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Microencapsulated acids associated with essential oils and acid salts for piglets in the nursery phase,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of commercial blends of organic and inorganic acids combined with essential oils for piglets in the nursery phase. The formulations were administered as microcapsules or as acid salts. Ninety-six, Pen Ar Lan, barrow and female piglets, weaned at a body weight of 600 kg ± 12 kg and age of 23 days were subjected to four treatments. The animals were distributed in randomized blocks of three animals per pen and 8 replicates per treatment. The treatments consisted of four different diets: control (free of organic acids); acid and essential oil blends (fumaric acid 10,5%, malic acid 8.0%, essential oils; in microencapsulated form); microencapsulated acid blend (phosphoric acid 10%, citric acid 10%, malic acid 10%, fumaric acid 20%; in microencapsulated form); and acid salt blend (formic acid 40.5%, phosphoric acid 13.6%, propionic acid 4.9% and salts (23.2% calcium and 4.4% phosphorus available). The performance parameters, digestive transit time, weights of organs of the digestive tract, bacterial count of feces (Lactobacillus, E coli and Salmonella ssp and Clostridium), pH of the stomach and duodenal content did not differ between treatment groups (P > 005). All treatments containing organic acids exhibited positive effects on diarrhea control (P < 005). The cecal contents of volatile fatty acids (VFA) were higher in piglets fed diets containing acids than in animals that received the control diet (P < 005), and blends containing essential oils improved the jejunum villus height compared with the control group. The use of diets containing acids improved diarrhea control and VFA production in the cecum, and specifically the diets containing microencapsulated acid blends required the lowest doses to be effective.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22395/19461,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Cryopreservation of tambaqui semen using a dry shipper and a programmed freezing machine,"Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is a native freshwater fish that is of great importance for Brazilian aquaculture. Because of this importance, several techniques have been developed to improve the reproduction of this species in captivity. One of these techniques is the cryopreservation of sperm. In an effort to increase the efficiency of cryopreservation protocols, researchers have tried to determine suitable diluting solutions and freezing methods, which will provide a better post-thaw sperm quality. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of different diluents and freezing methods for the cryopreservation of tambaqui (C. macropomum) sperm. Samples of fresh semen were diluted in different treatments (Glucose 5% + 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide – DMSO, Glucose 5% + 10% Methyl glycol – MG, BTS + 10% DMSO and BTS + 10% MG) at a 1:9 dilution rate and frozen in a programmed freezing machine and a dry shipper. The semen samples were thawed and evaluated for vitality, sperm morphology and kinetics. Cryopreserved semen with DMSO and using the programmed freezing machine provided a greater percentage of motile sperm (15.44 ± 1.04%) after thawing compared to the dry shipper (3.99 ± 0.55%), regardless of the diluent. Additionally, DMSO showed better sperm velocities than MG regardless of the freezing method and the extender employed. A higher percentage of living spermatozoa was observed when glucose (37.28 ± 1.32%) (regardless of the freezing method and cryoprotectant) and DMSO (37.98 ± 1.25%) was used in the programmed freezing machine. For morphology, a greater amount of normal spermatozoa (46.10 ± 1.82%) was observed when the semen was cryopreserved using a freezing machine programmed with DMSO as the cryoprotectant and Glucose or BTS (38.16 ± 1.9% and 39.26 ± 1.87%, respectively) as extenders. Therefore, we suggest the use of the DMSO (10%) cryoprotectant in association with the Glucose (5%) extended in the programmed freezing machine for cryopreservation of C. macropomum semen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21997/19459,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis and ingestive behavior of lambs fed diets containing cottonseed cake in substitution of soybean meal","The cottonseed cake is a co-product obtained after extraction of oil cottonseed, and because of their bromatological characteristics has potential use in ruminant feed, can increase the economy efficiency of animal production systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate diets with cottonseed cake in substitution of soybean meal through nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis and the ingestive behavior of lambs. Forty crossbred Santa Inês × Dorper non-castrated rams with average initial weight of 20.9 ± 2.5 kg were distributed into a completely randomized design with four treatments and ten replicates, and fed diets containing cottonseed cake in substitution of 0, 33, 66 and 100% of soybean meal. The diets were composed of corn, soybean meal, cottonseed meal and hay, with forage:concentrate reason of 50:50, isonitrogenous, with 14% crude protein. The animals were confined individually in pens with slatted floor, the evaluations of ingestive behavior, which included observations of the feeding, rumination and idle times were performed in a period of 24 hours, in 5-minute intervals. At 97 days of experiment, a spot urine sample was collected from all animals to quantify the concentrations of nitrogen, creatinine, allantoin, uric acid, xanthine and hypoxanthine in the urine. The data were subjected to variance analysis and regression, adopting ?= 0.05. There was no significant difference between treatments for nitrogen balance, the synthesis of nitrogen compounds, and microbial efficiency. In addition, there was no effect of replacing soybean meal by cottonseed meal on feeding behavior of animals. Cottonseed cake can replace soybean meal up to 100% in diets for lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21787/19458,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Performance, nutrient digestibility, and quantitative carcass traits of lambs fed sunflower seeds and vitamin E","The aim of this study was to evaluate performance, nutrient digestibility, and carcass quantitative traits of lambs fed diets with and without sunflower seeds and vitamin E. Thirty-two uncastrated lambs at approximately 60 days of age, with 15 ± 0.2 kg, were housed in individual stalls and slaughtered at 32.0 ± 0.2 kg body weight. Treatments consisted of the following four diets: C = sugarcane + concentrate; CS = sugarcane + concentrate with sunflower seeds; CE = sugarcane + concentrate with 1,000 mg vitamin E kg-1 diet dry matter (DM); and CSE = sugarcane + concentrate with sunflower seeds and 1,000 mg vitamin E kg-1 diet DM. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (with and without sunflower seeds and with or without vitamin E, on the diet DM basis), and means were compared by Tukey’s test at 5% significance level. Consumption of vitamin E intake by the lambs provided (P < 0.05) the highest ether extract intake (20.91 g day-1) and consequently the highest (P < 0.05) digestibility of this nutrient (85.34%); however, it reduced (P < 0.05) the intakes of total carbohydrates (394.81 g day-1) and non-fibrous carbohydrates (242.47 g day-1) as a direct consequence of the diet composition. Inclusion of sunflower seeds and vitamin E in the lamb diets did not influence (P > 0.05) carcass morphological or quantitative measurements. Sunflower seeds and vitamin E showed to be satisfactory alternatives for inclusion in the concentrate for feedlot lambs, providing good performance and quality carcasses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21549/19478,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Tissue composition and allometric growth of tissues from commercial cuts and carcass of Texel lambs slaughtered with different weights,"In this study, we evaluated the tissue composition, the ratios between different issues, and the allometric growth of tissues from the commercial cuts neck, shoulder, rib, and leg, and of the carcass of Texel lambs. Thirty uncastrated male lambs born from single calvings were used in this experiment. Lambs were weaned, confined individually, and distributed into five treatments with six replications. Each treatment consisted of a predefined slaughter weight (T23 – initial slaughter, T25, T30, T35, and T40). The proportion of bone decreased linearly in the shoulder, rib, and legs, but remained constant in the neck. The proportion of muscle decreased in the rib, whereas in the other cuts it remained constant. The percentage of fat increased as the slaughter weight of the lambs was increased, for all cuts. In all cuts and in the carcass, bone and muscle showed early growth (b < 1), whereas fat displayed late growth (b > 1). The proportion of bone decreased and fat increased linearly in the carcass, and the proportion of muscle was not influenced by the slaughter weight of the lambs. The muscle/fat ratio decreased in all cuts, and consequently in the half-carcass, as the slaughter weight was increased. The muscle/ bone ratio increased in the shoulder, rib, leg, and half-carcass, but there was no significant effect on the neck. The bone and muscle tissues showed early growth, whereas the fat had late growth in the different commercial cuts and carcass of Texel lambs. The tissue growth pattern of the shoulder may be representative of the allometric growth of the different carcass tissues. An increase in the slaughter weight of Texel lambs leads to a reduction of the muscle/fat ratio, due to the higher deposition of fat in the carcass of these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21415/19455,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment utilized gender as a randomized blocking factor in a 5 × 2 factorial scheme. The study goats were from the Alpine, Anglo-Nubian, 1/2 Boer x Alpine, 3/4 Boer x Alpine, and 7/8 Boer x Alpine breeds. Half of the goats were fed an experimental diet, whereas the other half were given the same diet supplemented with 1.5 L milk daily. The kids were slaughtered after they attained 30 kg body weight. The 1/2 Boer x Alpine goats showed superior growth performance because they exhibiting considerable heterosis. These animals are especially easy to use given that there is no need to maintain cross-bred females (½ Boer x Alpine e ¾ Boer x Alpine) in the flock. Using milk in the feed the animals does not adversely affect growth performance or biometric features. Moreover, it helps to reduce the total weight of the stomach and leads to a 51.39% savings on feed. Dietary supplementation of milk in goat feed is recommended so long as there is excess milk available on the property.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21299/19454,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Seasonal milk contamination by aflatoxin m1, organophosphates and carbamates in Paraná – Brazil","Aiming to evaluate the milk contamination in the dairy production systems (DPS) for mycotoxins and chemical residues of organophosphates and carbamates it was made a study encompassing 96 DPS in three regions of Parana state. There were collected samples of milk, water and food and they were evaluated for chemical residues in all samples and aflatoxin only for food and milk. Mycotoxins in food (aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2, zearalenone and ochratoxin) were detected by the method of thin layer chromatography – TLC and for the determination of aflatoxin M1 was used an immunoassay kit competitive ELISA Ridascreen®. The residues of organophosphates and carbamates were performed by colorimetric method qualitatively. There were evaluated the differences between regions, periods and the sources of mycotoxin contamination. Carbamates and organophosphates were screened for their presence in milk and the sources of food and water. Then it was estimated the contributions of each mycotoxin for milk contamination, as well as their respective contaminated food. Differences were found between periods (p < 0,05) for milk contamination with aflatoxin M1 – AFM1. For carbamates and organophosphates were found different contamination sources (p < 0,01). For the carbamates the source were pesticides used to parasitic herd control and for the organophosphates pesticides used in agriculture. For food sources contamination resulting in the AFM1 contamination it was detected that aflatoxin B1 – AFB1 was the main source. The aflatoxin G1 – AFG1 showed a strong correlation (p < 0,01) with AFB1 levels suggesting causal relationship is a function of fungal strains producing both at the same time. It was also found the prevalence of aflatoxin contamination in 70% of contaminated samples and its predominant presence in relation to other mycotoxins in all kinds of foods analyzed. By identifying the checkpoints of contamination can be proposed the inclusion of practical management methods to avoid this.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21652/19641,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Morphogenetic and structural characteristics of clones of elephant grass managed under intermittent stocking,"This work was carried out to evaluate the morphogenetic and structural characteristics of basal and aerial tillers of two dwarf elephant grass clones (BRS Kurumi and CNPGL 00-1-3) managed under intermittent stocking in six grazing cycles. A completely randomized experimental design with three replications (paddocks) in split-split-plot arrangements was used. The clones were allocated to the plots, tiller classes were assigned to the subplots and grazing cycles to sub subplots. Higher values for basal tillers than aerial tillers were seen for the following characteristics: leaf elongation rate (12.8 and 5.1 cm/tiller/day), leaf appearance rate (0.26 and 0.19 leaves/tiller/day), stem elongation rate (0.38 and 0.16 cm/tiller/day), senescence rate (0.98 and 0.47 cm/tiller/day), total number of leaves (9.3 and 7.1 leaves/ tiller), number of live leaves (7.7 and 5.8 leaves/tiller) and final length of leaf blades (33.5 and 20.0 cm). Phyllochron was lower for basal (4.0 days/leaf) than aerial tillers (5.5 days/leaf). The leaf life span increased with the advance of the grazing cycles, averaging 31.2 days. The tiller density increased with the advance of the grazing cycles showing an average increase of 167% of aerial tillers and 62% of basal tillers for both clones. The morphogenetic and structural characteristics of dwarf clones were influenced jointly by the clones and the availability of the environmental factors of growth during the spring and summer. The high leaf elongation rates, associated with high leaf appearance rate, reveal the potential of high production dry matter of leaves and restoration of leaf area after grazing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19458/19453,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Mombasa grass characterisation at different heights of grazing in an intercropping system with Babassu and monoculture,"The aim of this study was to evaluate agronomic and structural traits, as well as root mass, of Panicum maximum cv. Mombasa in different conditions of animal grazing in the same pasture in a monoculture system and a Pasture-Forestry Intercropping System (intercropped with Babassu palm trees). Evaluations were performed from December 2012 to February 2013. The systems were kept under continuous grazing with sheep (20 kg live weight on average) throughout the evaluation period. The design was completely randomised into split plots, in which each plot was the system and the subplots were grazing heights, with three sample cycles. The Babassu palm tree influenced the production of the aerial-part dry matter in the intercropping system due to a decrease in grass tillering caused by shading stress. The root dry matter decreased influenced by shading and intensity of animal grazing in the evaluated heights, leading to a reduction as decreased the grass height. The monoculture system led to better results for the same heights in all parameters in comparison to the intercropping system, including the number of tillers, dry matter production (DM), leaf-area index (LAI) and DM (%), which were higher in the monoculture system regardless of the assessed heights. The natural shade of Babassu palms negatively affected the productive and structural traits of Panicum maximum cv. Mombasa, thereby altering the grass structure and lowering its productive capacity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19132/19452,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Tifton 85 grass responses to different nitrogen levels and cutting intervals,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of five levels of N and two regrowth intervals on the structural, productive, and nutritional characteristics of Tifton 85 grass (Cynodon spp). The experiment was conducted in a hay production field at the State University of West Paraná, planted in 2004 with Cynodon spp. cv. Tifton 85. The experiment was established in a randomized block design with factorial treatments of five N fertilization amounts (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha-1 cut-1) applied as urea after each cut, and two regrowth intervals (28 and 35 d), with four replicates. N application promoted changes in plant structure, such as increased canopy height, stem length, leaf elongation rate, and dry mass (DM) production. The greatest N use efficiency, considering the four harvests, occurred in the plot with 25 kg N ha-1 cut-1 at the 35-d interval, with a production of 13.79 kg DM kg-1 of N applied. A nutritional analysis indicated that 100 kg ha-1 of N cut-1 promoted higher crude protein (CP) at 28 d, with the highest concentration observed in the fourth cut (208.2 g kg-1 DM) and the lowest in the second cut (140.12 g kg-1 DM). The content average in the four cuts for CP and LIG at 28 days of regrowth was 175.85 and 104.33 kg-1 g MS and at 35 days of regrowth interval was of 164.45 and 118.65 g kg-1 DM, respectively. No differences were found between regrowth intervals in the contents of mineral matter and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Environmental factors including the wide variation in precipitation (greater than 200 mm between the peak in December 2010 and the lowest in March 2011) greatly influenced Tifton 85 grass production, affecting DM and the nutritional value of the forage in each cut.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18368/19451,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Grazing behavior of non-supplemented and supplemented heifers on Italian ryegrass pasture,"We evaluated the grazing behavior of heifers, at two phenological stages (vegetative and reproductive) of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), in four times of the day (early morning, morning, evening, and night), with heifers either exclusively grazing or with oat, or corn grain, supplementation. The experimental design was completely randomized, in sub-subdivided plot arrangement, in which the main plots were the feeding systems, the sub-plots were the phenological stages and the sub-sub-plots were the times of day. We assessed ingestion behavior along 24 hours through visual observation, on four evaluation dates, two during the vegetative stage and two during the reproductive stage, studying time spent on grazing, rumination, or other activities, as well as number and duration of, and interval between meals. Supplemented heifers remained less time at a feeding station, performed fewer bites daily and, during the reproductive stage of the ryegrass, spent more time in other activities. Grazing time of supplemented heifers was shorter in the morning and at night, and the duration of their meals was shorter at night. A change occurred in the pattern of time use when heifers received supplement, and when the structural and qualitative characteristics of the pasture changed during the vegetative and reproductive phenological stages of ryegrass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18206/19450,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Characters of Pennisetum spp. used for the initial selection in the genetic improvement program for elephant grass,"The present study was carried out at the Experimental Station of the Agronomical Institute of Pernambuco (IPA) in Itambé-PE to analyse different characters for the initial selection of Pennisetum spp. clones based on the coefficient of repeatability and the number of measurements required to predict their genotypic values (with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.80). Considering the high number of genotypes in Phase I of the genetic improvement program and the requirement to reduce this number before progression to Phase II, it is relevant to identify characters with high genotypic values, which are easy to measure or acquire and that can be used in the initial selection. Therefore, we chose to evaluate the coefficient of repeatability and the number of measurements necessary to predict the genotypic values of 23 characters, either morphological or productive, of 472 Pennisetum spp. clones, in non-repeated plots. The coefficient of repeatability was estimated using the components of the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Dry matter concentration, leaf blade colour, midrib colour, leaf sheath colour, and internode colour were less affected by environmental conditions, and it was possible to predict their genotypic values (R2 = 0.80) with a maximum of four measurements, indicating that these characters are predictable and reliable for initial selection of Pennisetum spp.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18188/19640,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effects of postgrazing residue on morphogenetic and structural characteristics of Tifton 85 pastures,"The ideal time to start grazing is when pastures reach 95% light interception. The use of residual leaf area index (rLAI) to time the interruption of grazing under intermittent grazing has recently been studied in forage species in different climatic conditions in Brazil. However, studies evaluating the formation and development of leaves and tillers through morphogenetic and structural variables in functional rLAI are still lacking for Tifton 85 pastures. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of varying rLAI in successive grazing cycles on morphogenetic and structural characteristics of Tifton 85 pasture grazed intermittently by sheep. Morphogenetic and structural characteristics were evaluated in three grazing cycles under three rLAI conditions (0.8, 1.6, and 2.4). The regrowth interval (time taken to return to 95% light interception) of pastures increased from 21.33 to 29.66 days with decreasing rLAI. The leaf appearance rate increased at a rate of 0.02 leaves tiller-1 day-1 and the number of live leaves per tiller increased by 0.41 with decreasing rLAI. Phyllochron, leaf elongation rate, final leaf length, leaf senescence rate, and stem elongation rate decreased linearly with decreasing rLAI. The number of live leaves per tiller was lower (7.97) in the third grazing cycle, probably owing to the higher senescence rate observed that same cycle, while the other variables had higher values. The 2.4 rLAI condition promotes excessive stem elongation, reduced leaf appearance, lower number of live leaves per tiller, and increased senescence of leaves, while the 0.8 and 1.6 rLAI conditions promote desirable morphogenetic and structural characteristics, which correlate directly with forage quality. In order to avoid excessive forage losses, grazing must occur preferentially by the end of March, when climatic conditions still support the appropriate development of the plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18189/19449,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Pregnancy rate evaluation in lactating and non-lactating Nelore cows subjected to fixed-time artificial insemination using injectable progesterone,"Most fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols utilize progesterone (P4) as a hormonal source to achieve synchronization of estrus in cattle. The use of an injectable P4 source to control estrus would be an interesting pharmacological strategy owing to the practicality of parenteral application. However, the effects of injectable P4 on estrus cycle control in cattle remain poorly studied. In particular, no existing studies have investigated the effect of injectable P4 on the fertility of cows subjected to FTAI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy rate of lactating and non-lactating Nelore cows subjected to FTAI with injectable P4. Of the 422 non-lactating cows in this study, 162 (38.3%) became pregnant by 60 days post-FTAI. In the lactating group (n = 516), 166 (32.1%) were pregnant by 60 days after treatment with injectable P4. The proportions of lactating and non-lactating cows becoming pregnant were compared using the chi-square test, adopting a significance level of P < 0.05. It was found that the pregnancy rate of the cows subjected to FTAI with injectable P4 was influenced by lactation status.

37,2016,Conservation and viability of refrigerated platelet-rich plasma from New Zealand rabbits,"Fifteen male New Zealand rabbits were used in this study, with the aim of storing their platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for 30 days at 4-6 °C to investigate its conservation and viability during this period. Thirty samples of PRP were prepared and sorted into three equal groups (G1, G2, and G3), and every three days a sample was taken out for evaluationof the number of platelets, mean platelet volume (MPV), pH of the plasma, aggregation post addition of calcium thromboplastin, and for the presence of bacterial and fungal contamination. Results suggested that, for the number of platelets, there was no linear relationship over time. However, when comparing the number of platelets pre-storage to that post-storage, a statistical difference was observed. The hemogram MPV variables, pre and post-storage, also did not relate with time however, there was a statistical difference between the MPV of hemogram and MPV pre-storage, and between MPV pre-storage and MPV post-storage. From the pH evaluation, no influence of time on the variables was found, but statistical differences were found in the samples after storage between 30 and 6 days, 30 and 24 days, and 30 and 27 days. Platelet aggregation occurred within twenty seconds in all samples, independent of storage time. There was no growth of bacteria or yeast in any sample; however, mold growth occurred in the samples stored for 21 days from G1 and G3. It can be concluded that the PRP of rabbits can be stored in 4-6 °C refrigeration for up to18 days and still maintain the number of platelets, with no significant pH alteration or bacterial or fungal contamination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23527/19442,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Effect of colistin and tylosin used as feed additives on the performance, diarrhea incidence, and immune response of  nursery pigs","For the last several decades, antimicrobial compounds have been used as feed additives to promote piglet growth at weaning, through the prevention of subclinical and clinical disease. However, few studies have assessed the influence of these antibiotics on the immune response of nursery pigs, as well as the relation between performance, health, and immunity of animals that receive feed additives. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of colistin and tylosin when used as feed additives on the performance, incidence of diarrhea, and immune response of nursery pigs. In this study, 72 weaned pigs (average age, 28 days) were allotted into one of three treatment groups: a control group (feed with no antibiotics), tylosin group (feed containing 22 ppm tylosin), and colistin group (feed containing 20 ppm colistin). Weekly, during a five week period, the average daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed conversion ratio of the pigs were evaluated. Stools were scored daily, in accordance with a fecal texture scale. Blood samples were collected on the day of housing (d0) and on d7, d21, d28, and d35 for immune cell phenotyping. The results of this study showed that piglets in both the colistin and tylosin groups exhibited a significantly higher average daily feed intake, resulting in a higher body weight at the end of the experimental period (d35) when compared with piglets from the control group. Colistin and tylosin also significantly reduced the incidence of diarrhea. Colistin and tylosin modulated the piglets’ immune responses, particularly on d28, by changing the percentage of circulating B lymphocytes, CD4+CD8+ T cells, and the CD4:CD8 ratio.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22590/19638,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Prevalence and risk factors for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease in the canine population of the tourist city of Ibiúna, São Paulo, Brazil","The aims of the study were to determine the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, and to determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiúna, São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 570 blood samples of dogs were collected from four regions in the 48 districts of the municipality, from September 2007 to March 2008, and submitted for serological examination. Laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence, respectively. Of the 570 animals examined, 13 (2.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2%-3.8%) were seropositive for leishmaniasis, and 35 (6.1%; 95% CI = 4.3%-8.3%) were seropositive for Chagas disease. A risk factor associated with seropositivity for Chagas disease in dogs was residence in a region with a predominance of small farms generally used for subsistence planting and leisure and surrounded by forest areas (odds ratio = 4.20). By contrast, there were no risk factors identified for leishmaniasis, leading us to conclude that leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are present in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiúna, São Paulo; however, additional studies are needed in order to fully define the risk factors associated with disease in this municipality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23509/19441,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Physicochemical and sensory characteristics of milk from cows in different lactation stages and calving orders,"Knowledge of the variation in milk composition is essential for determining milk quality, which is defined by several organoleptic properties. This study evaluated the effect of lactation stage and calving order on the physicochemical composition and sensory characteristics of milk from primiparous and multiparous lactating dairy cows. Milk samples were collected monthly from December 2011 to May 2012. Data were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Milk production (PROD), somatic cell count (SCC), and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) were significantly higher in multiparous cows, whereas the casein to total protein ratio (C/TP) was significantly higher in primiparous cows. All milk components except for non-fat dry solids (NDE) were significantly affected by lactation stage. Body condition score (BCS) was not affected by calving order or lactation stage. Color was the only sensory attribute affected by calving order. In conclusion, the physicochemical properties and sensory attributes of milk were affected by calving order and lactation stage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23286/19439,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis in dairy cattle in Ipameri, state of Goiás, Brazil","Leptospirosis is a disease with worldwide distribution and with risk to human health. In addition, it affects farm animals, and consequently, causes economic losses to farmers. Therefore, understanding the epidemiological profile of the disease in each geographical region is essential. This study was conducted in the rural properties of the municipality of Ipameri, state of Goiás, Brazil, where leptospirosis has not been reported in dairy farming. The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in dairy cattle, identify the serovars present, and correlate these results with factors that could favor the appearance of the disease. For this purpose, 285 blood samples were collected from dairy cows and microscopic agglutination tests were conducted to identify the 15 serovars of Leptospira interrogans. A structured questionnaire was applied during the visits to the properties to assess the factors associated with leptospirosis. The prevalence was found to be 18.9%, and the serovars present in the region included Hardjo, Wolffi, Canicola, Hebdomadis, Australis, and Icterohaemorrhagiae. The variables associated with leptospirosis were the presence of reproductive changes in the herd, presence of rodents, increased daily production of milk, hired labor, and lower level of education of the producers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22521/19437,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Risk factors associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV seropositivity in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) from the State of Paraiba,  Northeastern Brazil","This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BoHV-1) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) infections in buffaloes in the State of Paraíba, Northeastern Brazil, using 136 female buffaloes ? 24 months old from 14 herds. For the serological diagnosis of the BoHV-1 and BVDV infections, the virus-neutralization test (VN) was used and in each herd, an epidemiological questionnaire was applied in order to obtain data to be used in the risk factor analysis. Of the 136 animals 86 (63.2%) were positive for BoHV-1 and 12 (8.8%) for BVDV. The presence of watering points (odds ratio = 17.68; 95% CI = 3.74 – 83.04) was identified as risk factor for BoHv-1, and animal purchasing was a risk factor for both BoHV-1 (odds ratio = 68.64; 95% CI = 12.28 – 383.73) and BVDV (odds ratio = 3.64; 95% CI = 1.04 – 12.76). The results from the present study showed an evidence of the presence of BoHV-1 and BVDV infections in buffaloes from the State of Paraíba, Northeastern Brazil. It is suggested that control and prevention measures should be adopted, such as the use of diagnostic tests prior to animal purchasing and the use of vaccines to avoid the introduction of infected animals into the herds and the consequent dissemination of the infections, minimizing economic losses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21281/19436,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Growth and nutrient uptake patterns in plants of Duboisia sp,"Characterizing growth and nutrient uptake is important for the establishment of plant cultivation techniques that aim at high levels of production. The culturing of Duboisia sp., although very important for world medicine, has been poorly studied in the field, since the cultivation of this plant is restricted to a few regions. The objective of this paper is to characterize growth and nutrient absorption during development in Duboisia sp. under a commercial cultivation system, and in particular to assess the distribution of dry matter and nutrients in the leaves and branches. Our work was performed on a commercial production farm located in Arapongas, Paraná, Brazil, from March 2009 to February 2010. A total of 10 evaluations took place at approximately 10-day intervals, starting 48 days after planting and ending at harvesting, 324 days after planting. The growth parameters analyzed were the height of the plants and the dry matter of the leaves and of branches, while the chemical composition of the leaves and branches was used to study nutrient absorption. Data were submitted to regression analysis. Growth in height followed Richards’ model, mirroring the rise in air temperature and water availability. Phytomass accumulation in the aerial parts of the plants was slow during the first 150 days, but grew 25 times from that point to harvesting. Starting from 260 days, phytomass accumulation in the leaves began to be notable, while in the branches, a growth of 169% occurred, a pattern of biomass partitioning that is unfavorable for the producer. Accumulation of nutrients mirrored the accumulation of phytomass, showing the same unfavorable partition. The nutritional demand for macronutrients and micronutrients was, respectively, N < K < Ca > P > Mg > S and Fe >Mn> Zn > B > Cu.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22727/19430,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Experimental infection of broiler chicks with Salmonella Typhimurium from pigeon (Columba livia),"Several cases of animal and human salmonellosis caused by the Salmonella serotype Typhimurium have been reported. In animals, subclinical infection favors pathogen dissemination through feces. In this context, the domestic pigeon (Columba livia) with an asymptomatic condition may play an important role in the transmission of salmonellosis, through the elimination of contaminated feces in commercial aviaries or in poultry feed facilities, causing economic losses to the poultry industry and presenting a risk to public health. This study aimed to evaluate the mortality, clinical signs and the presence of Salmonella Typhimurium in the feces and organs of chicks previously inoculated with bacteria isolated from a pigeon. One-day-old chicks were distributed in two experimental groups (G1 and G2) of 32 birds each, and a control group of six birds. Two inocula of 0.4 and 0.7 mL with 105 and 106 colony forming units were used in G1 and G2 birds, respectively. At 1, 4, 7 and 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) fecal samples were pooled from each cage and individual cloacal swabs were collected. At 14 dpi, all chicks were euthanized and samples were collected from the liver, spleen, lung, cecum and intestine for microbiological analysis. Mortality was only observed among G2 birds (6.25%). Most birds presented clinical signs of diarrhea at 4 dpi and no symptom as observed at 14 dpi. The results from cloacal swabs demonstrated bacterial elimination in 68.8% and 53.1% of G2 and G1 birds, respectively at 1 dpi. Additionally, fecal samples had elevated bacterial shedding in all four periods of observation , with a higher excretion at 4 dpi (62.5%) for both groups. Among G2 birds, 74.2% were positive for the pathogen in the intestine; G1 birds presented the lowest rate of lung infection (29%), and both groups had more than 50% positivity for liver and caeca. The results revealed that infected chicks with a Salmonella Typhimurium strains isolated from pigeons may host the pathogen in several organs, and simultaneously present diarrheic disorders with significant levels of bacterial excretion in feces.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19366/19433,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Characterization of edible films of Swartzia burchelli phosphated starches and development of coatings for post-harvest application to cherry tomatoes,"The market demand for corn starch and cassava continues to increase because of their use in edible applications, their biodegradable nature, and other appealing properties. As a result, there is a need to identify alternative starch sources, for example, the seeds of S. burchelli, with the potential to be modified for use in post-harvest applications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and characterize edible films based on the starch phosphates of the seeds of S. burchelli, with the specific aim to apply these starches to cherry tomatoes for post-harvest conservation. After extraction, the starch was phosphorylated with sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) in different concentrations and times according to a 2 x 2 factorial design with additional treatment (native starch). After modification, the starch phosphates were selected for the preparation of edible films using glycerol as a plasticizer, in proportions of 5, 10, 15 and 20% for each selected starch. The films were measured for thickness, permeability to water vapor and solubility in water. According to their permeability values, 4 films were selected for application in the coverage of cherry tomatoes. The conservation of cherry tomatoes with and without coverage was studied over 8 evaluation times (up to 21 days) at 10±2 °C and 80±5% relative humidity. The weight loss, soluble solids, titratable acidity, maturation index, and firmness were measured every 3 days during storage. The starch phosphates showed a phosphorus content within that established by standards, such that the resulting films are acceptable for use in food for human consumption. The edible films presented with an acceptable appearance and without the development of cracks. The concentration of glycerol and the type of starch influenced the characteristics of the films, increasing the permeability and reducing the water solubility of the various edible films. The best result obtained regarding the conservation of cherry tomatoes was observed for fruits with edible coatings of greater permeability to water vapor; such fruits exhibited only a slight decline in firmness during storage compared with the control. It can be concluded that the modification performed on the starch and the glycerol concentration positively influenced the properties of the edible films, allowing for optimal use in post-harvest applications. Similarly, the edible coatings conferred better appearance to the fruits, maintaining their maturation index and firmness during the experimental period and providing better post-harvest storage conditions for the cherry tomatoes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22672/19431,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Nematicidal activity of crambe extracts on Meloidogyne spp.,"Alternative methods for the control of nematodes, such as the use of plant secondary metabolites, can be explored for integrated pest management systems. The objective of this work was to assess the best solvent for obtaining allyl isothiocyanate from Crambe abyssinica leaves, and the effects of this extract on Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. Dry leaves of C. abyssinica at 200 mg L-1 were used to prepare extracts by using water (by infusion and grinding), acetone, water + ethanol (hydroalcoholic extraction), methanol, hexane, and chloroform as solvents. Following the evaporation of the solvents, the residue was resuspended in water for use in the experiments. Distilled water and chemical nematicide were used as control treatments. Once the most effective extracts were defined, the following dosages of dried crambe leaves were used: 0, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg L-1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify the allyl isothiocyanate present in the extracts. After the solvents evaporated, the residues were eluted with water and used in assays with 200 eggs for the hatching test or 200 second stage juveniles (J2) for mobility and mortality tests. The hydroalcoholic extract was the most effective in reducing the hatching of M. incognita and M. javanica juveniles, by 71.6 and 74.4 percentage points, respectively. The mortality of M. incognita and M. javanica in the hydroalcoholic extract was 93.2 and 64.4%, respectively, followed by the methanol extract (17.6 and 34%) and the extract obtained by grinding (9.2 and 28%). The hydroalcoholic extract at 250 mg L-1 showed high nematicidal effect. The HPLC analysis of the extracts revealed that only the methanol and hydroalcoholic extracts had allyl isothiocyanate, indicating that the inhibitory effects on the hatching, mobility, and mortality were not solely attributed to the presence of this compound.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22378/19635,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Estimated length of soybean phenological stages,"The use of modeling is a trend for agronomic science that aims to detect factors that could limit the growing practices and influence the potential yield of some crops. The objective of this study was to calculate the accumulated thermal time and estimate the phenological stages length of three soybean cultivars in two crop years, using agronomic models associated to meteorological variables. Two experiments were conducted in a field at the Agroclimatology Laboratory (LAGRO) of the Federal University of Santa Maria/UFSM, campus of Frederico Westphalen/RS, Brazil during the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 crop years. A randomized block in a factorial scheme 6x3 with six spatial arrangements (45, crossed, 20, 20x40, 20x60 and 20x80 cm) and three cultivars with different cycles and growth habits (BMX Ativa RR/determinate, BMX Turbo RR/indeterminate and BMX Potência RR/indeterminate) with three replications were used for the experimental design. Sowing was held on 11/28/2012 and 12/02/2013. The assessed phenological stages were sowing-emergence; emergence – final vegetative; final vegetative – full bloom; full bloom – physiological maturity. The duration of each stage was related to meteorological parameters: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and thermal time. Air temperature influences soybean growth and development. The accumulated thermal time varies between years and among cultivars, and it is the main contributor to the estimated duration of the phenological stages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22392/19645,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Spatial distribution of organic carbon and humic substances in irrigated soils under different management systems in a semi-arid zone in Ceará, Brazil","Spatial distribution of organic carbon and humic substances in irrigated soils under different management systems in a semi-arid zone in Ceará, Brazil Knowledge of the spatial variability in soil properties can contribute to effective use and management. This study was conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution of the levels of total organic carbon (TOC) and humic substances (humic acid (C-FAH), fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), and humin fraction (C-HUM)) in an Ultisol under different land uses, located in the irrigated perimeter of Baixo Acaraú-CE, transition to semiarid Ceará. The distribution and spatial dependence of the humic fractions were evaluated using descriptive statistics, including semivariogram analysis and data interpolation (kriging). The TOC showed a pure nugget effect, whereas the other fractions showed moderate spatial dependence. Forested and banana cultivation areas showed similar distributions of C-FAH and C-FAF, due to the high input of organic matter (leaves and pseudostems) in the area of banana cultivation and the absence of soil disturbance in the forested area. Data interpolation (kriging) and mapping were useful tools to assess the distribution and spatial dependence of soil attributes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22377/19475,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Comparison between biodegradable polymers from cassava starch and glycerol as additives to biogas production,"In this study, we compared cassava starch-based biodegradable polymers (PBMs) and glycerol (G) as additives used to increase biogas production from the co-digestion of swine wastewater (ARS). We chose to work with an inoculum comprising 40% (v/v) of the total volume of the reactor; this inoculum was obtained from a Canadian model digester for treating swine waste. In the anaerobic digestion process, batch reactors were used on a laboratory scale with a total volume of approximately 4 L and a working volume of 3.2 L. Three treatments were conducted to compare the efficiency of solid removal, the chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the production of biogas. The first treatment contained only swine waste; the second included the addition of glycerol at 1, 3, and 5% (w/v); and the third treatment included the addition of 1, 3, and 5% (w/v) of PBM residue in relation to the swine wastewater. From the results, it can be concluded that higher yields were obtained for the treatment with 3% PBM and 1% glycerol. Most treatments showed high removal rates of total solids and total volatile solids. Reductions lower than 70% were obtained only for treatments with PBM and glycerol at a ratio of 5%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22090/19634,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Inert powders alone or in combination with neem oil for controlling Spodoptera eridania and Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae,"Laboratory studies was carry out to evaluated the potential of inert powders: bentonite, kaolin and diatomaceous earth (DE) applied as dust and aqueous suspension alone and associated with neem oil to the control Spodoptera eridania and Spodoptera frugiperda second instar larvae. In dust applications, 100% mortality of S. eridania, at the concentrations of 1.5 and 2.0 grams of bentonite, and 93.3% of S. frugiperda, at the concentration of 2.0 g were observed. DE at the height concentration (2.0 g) caused 76.2% mortality of S. eridania and 46.6% of S. frugiperda. Kaolin, in all concentrations, was the only treatment that did not differed from the control for S. eridania but was different, in the high concentration, for S. frugiperda. When the plants were treated, larvae of S. eridania fed in the treatment DE, had an increase of two days in larval period. For the sex ratio, the percentage of males was greater in the treatments with kaolin, for both species. When powders was applied suspended in water separately or combined with neem oil, the best results were observed in combined of the bentonite (10%) + neem, with 100% mortality for both species, and kaolin (10%) + neem with 78.5% and 95.6% mortality for S. frugiperda and S. eridania, respectively. These treatments were classified as non-additive synergistic.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21820/19424,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Base temperature as a function of genotype: a foundation for modeling phenology of temperate fruit species,"To complete each phase of the growing season, plants must accumulate thermal time at lower base temperature (Tb). Little information exists on Tb variation between either fruit species or cultivars of the same species. We therefore aimed to determine the lower base temperature for contrasting genotypes in precocity of peach, plum, grape, pear, and kiwi. Twigs 25-35 cm long for the following cultivars: peach, Tropic Beauty (TB) and Eragil (ER); plum, Gulf Blaze (GB) and Letícia (LE); grape, Chardonnay (CH) and Cabernet Sauvignon (CS); pear, Smith (SM) and Packham’s (PA); and kiwi, Golden King (GK) and Hayward (HA) were collected in orchards in Veranópolis, RS Estate, on 06/13/2014, with 0 h at temperatures ? 7.2°C (chilling hours; HC) in the field. Intact twigs packed in black plastic film were subjected to 1,008 HC at 0°C in incubators to overcome dormancy and then transferred to temperatures of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12°C on single-node cuttings planted in phenolic foam to define effective heat temperature for the genotypes. Over 110 d, budburst of the buds was evaluated in 2-3-d intervals in the green-tip stage. The resulting inverse data of number of days to budburst (1/days to budburst) was inserted into regression curves to estimate Tb for each genotype. Historical phonological series comprised of 10 years for the analyzed cultivars and meteorological data of the cultivation sites were used to determine thermal time (degree-days) for the fruit trees during the growing season, considering different phenological phases. Temperate fruit species exhibited different Tb behaviors: Tb was lower for early cultivars (TB and GB = 2.2°C; CH = 2.1°C; SM = 4.4°C; GK = 4.3°C) and higher for late cultivars (ER = 6.3°C; LE = 6.2°C; CS = 4.3°C; HA and PA = 8.2°C) for all cultures. The Tb f fruit cultivars related directly with genotype chilling requirements: the higher the chilling requirement, the higher the Tb of the cultivar. Cultivars of the same fruit species yielded a sum of degree-days almost equal to finalize the growing season, regardless of the degree of precocity (TB = 1720; ER = 1801; GB = 1680; LE = 1718; CH = 2310; CS = 2369; SM = 2096; PA = 2003 GD; GK = 2775; HA = 2691). Regarding phenological phases, 82% of the assessed cases responded more to thermal time (degree-days) than to chronological time (d) to complete phenological steps. Differences in Tb between genotypes are a relevant factor for improving the accuracy and applicability of phenology models in agriculture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21946/19425,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,In vitro establishment and early development of barueiro (Dipteryx alata Vogel),"The barueiro (Dipteryx alata Vog.) is a native fruit species of the Cerrado ecoregion that has multiple uses. It is a wild species, and its cultivation is difficult. Furthermore, it is threatened with extinction. Plant tissue culture is a major tool for the conservation of germplasm, as well as a means of propagating high-quality seedlings on a large scale. However, this technique has not been used with barueiro, although it might provide valuable contributions to the process of barueiro domestication. The most popular method of cultivation is the use of the Murashige and Skoog medium (MS), which is considered one of the most nutritionally complete media. Woody plant medium (WPM) is indicated for the propagation of woody species, but there are no reports of its use for barueiro cultivation. Woody plants tend to have problems with rust in vitro during the establishment phase. Activated charcoal acts as an adjuvant for the adsorption of phenolic compounds, mitigating its effects in the medium. Thus, the objective of this study was to test four activated charcoal doses (0, 2, 4 and 6 g L-1) and three culture media: MS, WPM, and AA (over water agar) in the in vitro establishment of barueiro. The experimental design was a completely randomised (DIC), 4 × 3 factorial design with three replications. At 60 days after inoculation, the explants were evaluated for dry matter, fresh weight, stem diameter, shoot length, number of leaves, longest root length, germination rate, and chlorophyll contents. The MS medium supplemented with 3,0 g L-1 activated charcoal appeared to be the best for in vitro establishment of barueiro.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21605/19422,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Hydration patterns and physiologic quality of common bean seeds,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the hydration pattern of landrace bean genotypes and their physiological quality. The hydration curve of eight landrace (BAFs 07, 13, 23, 42, 44, 50, 55, 81) and two commercial cultivars (IPR-88-Uirapurú and Iapar 81) genotypes was determined from seed moisture. Determination of initial physiological quality was performed by germination and vigor tests (seedling performance and accelerated aging). Characterization of the genotypes, regarding accelerated aging tests, showed that BAFs 13, 42, 55 and 81 had the highest physiological potential, whereas BAFs 07, 23, 44, 50 and the commercial cultivars had lower physiological quality. The hydration curve followed a triphasic pattern with radicle protrusion occurring between 21 and 27 hours after seed hydration. The percentage of reserves translocated to the seedling during formation showed that BAF 42 had the highest conversion efficiency compared to the smaller efficiencies of BAFs 23, 50 and Iapar 81. The seedling length test showed that BAFs 42 and 55 had the most vigorous seedlings, which was driven by the high percentage of reserves translocated to the seedling during formation. BAFs 23, 50 and the cultivar Iapar 81 showed lower reserve translocation, demonstrating that low mobilization potential leads to smaller seedlings. The hydration of bean seeds during germination was affected by physiological quality, as genotypes considered more vigorous exhibited higher hydration rates than those of the less vigorous genotypes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21707/19423,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The treatments were the application of the herbicides bentazon (720 g ha-1), nicosulfuron (50 g ha-1), halosulfuron (112.5 g ha-1), oxadiazon (875 g ha-1) and 2.4-D (698 g ha-1), plus a control treatment without herbicide application. Phytotoxicity was assessed every seven days after application (DAA) of the herbicides until the symptoms disappeared. Foliar anatomical analyses of the leaves in the collected grass were conducted until the 35th DAA. The quantitative characters of the keel and wing region of the blade of Z. japonica were assessed, as well as the biometric characters, which were submitted to an analysis of variance F test, and the averages were compared by Tukey’s test at a probability of 5%. The values of the anatomical characters of the foliar blade were tested by cluster analysis. The application of herbicides did not negatively influence the height of the plants but did reduce their dry mass. Toxic symptoms disappeared after 21 DAA, with the only symptoms of injury observed in plants treated with the herbicides oxadiazon and nicosulfuron. In addition, the cluster analysis indicated the formation of a unique discriminatory group. Thus, the results show that the herbicides applied to Z. japonica were selective for the species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21488/19633,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Genotype by environment interaction of “carioca” seeded common bean advanced lines in northeastern Brazil,"The objectives of the present work were to identify common bean lines with high grain yield, adaptability and stability; stratify the environment; and detect the most important factors for the genotype by environment (G×E) interaction in northeastern Brazil. Nineteen experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with three replications during the rainy growing season at 11 locations in the States of Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Bahia in 2009 and 2010. In each experiment, 16 “carioca” seeded lines were evaluated, and the grain yield, assessed. Data were subjected to analyses of variance and adaptability and stability by the methodologies of Annicchiarico and Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interactions (AMMI), analysis of the factors for environmental stratification and joint analysis with decomposition of the G×E interaction in genotype by year and genotype by location. According to the AMMI method, BRS Estilo and CNFC 11951 were selected as stable high-yielding lines. CNFC 11954, IPR Juriti, CNFC 11948 and BRS Estilo were identified as stable high-yielding lines based on the methodology of Annicchiarico. BRS Estilo was identified as stable according to both methodologies and was therefore considered suitable for growth in the Northeast region for use as a parent line in regional breeding programs. The locations in this region used to test the common bean lines were informative, except Carira, which could be eliminated from the assay network. Interaction among genotypes, locations and years were observed, suggesting that assessments shoud be conducted at the largest number of locations and years, in this order of importance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21096/19669,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Quantification of storage proteins during seed imbibition of native species from the brazilian caatinga vegetation,"Poincianella pyramidalis (Fabaceae), Schinopsis brasiliensis (Anacardiaceae) and Sideroxylon obtusifolium (Sapotaceae) are native species of the Caatinga vegetation from northeastern Brazil and have both biological importance and potential economic uses. Little is known about the water uptake and degradation of storage proteins during seed germination of these species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the imbibition and quantify the amount of storage proteins during seed germination of P. pyramidalis, S. brasiliensis and S. obtusifolium. Two lots of S. obtusifolium seeds with different vigour were used. Four replicates of 20 seeds of P. pyramidalis, S. brasiliensis and S. obtusifolium, were sown onto gerboxes with blotting paper soaked in distilled water and incubated during 72, 200 and 624 hours. Before and after imbibition seeds were weighed and frozen at until the sequential extraction and analysis of the seed storage proteins. Based on our results, we conclude that seed germination of P. pyramidalis, S. brasiliensis and S. obtusifolium has a well-defined triphasic imbibition. All storage proteins content of P. pyramidalis and S. brasiliensis seeds degraded along with the seed imbibition. Likewise, the content of albumins, globulins and glutelins decreased as S. obtusifolium seeds absorbed water.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18909/19418,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Technological quality of grains of common beans selected genotypes from the carioca group,"Common bean variety improvement programs focus on productivity increase as their main goal. However, some characteristics related to technological quality must also be analyzed in order to assure that new recommended cultivars satisfy key commercial standards, related to consumer acceptance. This study evaluated the technological quality of seeds from different ‘carioca’ bean genotypes. We tested seeds from 25 bean genotypes, selected by the State Consortium for Research on Common Bean Improvement (including EMBRAPA, UFLA, UFV and EPAMIG) for the VCU assay of the carioca variety, including 21 new lines and 4 commercial cultivars, used as controls. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. We assessed the following traits: seed shape, seed constriction, 1000-seed weight, percentage of hard seeds, soluble solids content, cooking time, seed coat percentage, and hydration capacity. According to our results, the cultivars that met the commercial standards for seed shape and constriction were EMB14, CNFC 10432, CNFC 10408, EMB4, P-18163, Pérola and BRSMG Madrepérola. Genotypes MAIV-18259, VC-20, VC-23, RCII-219, CVIII-2, EMB4, MAIV-15204, CVIII-5, and BRSMG Majestoso had 1000-seed weight within carioca bean commercial standards (a minimum of 23g per 100 seeds). Most genotypes had no hard seeds. Lines CNFC 10408, MAIV-18259 and P-18163 had the highest soluble solids content. Twenty genotypes had cooking times below the maximum required by commercial standard, with lines EMB9, EMB4, MAIV-18524, CNFC 11965, VC-17, and CNFC 10432 having the shortest cooking time.

37,2016,Effects of growth regulator and nitrogen on yield and lodging of irrigated wheat,"High rates of nitrogen (N) increase plant growth, which can result in lodging. To avoid excessive growth of plants, plant growth regulators (PGRs), which cause internode length reduction, can be used. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the N nutritional status, growth, and yield of irrigated wheat as parameters using variable rates of nitrogen and growth regulator. Two experiments were conducted in Rio Paranaíba – MG in 2011 and 2012 using the BRS 264 cultivar. The treatments consisted of two concentrations of N (50 and 110 kg ha-1 as urea) and five concentrations of the growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 L ha-1 of Moddus® containing 25% w/v of trinexapac-ethyl). Each plot consisted of 20 rows of wheat spaced 0.17 m, six meters in length. We evaluated plant height, shoot dry matter accumulation, thousand-grain weight, number of grains per spike, yield, leaf N content in the index leaf and grain, amount of N uptake and export, and lodging index. The PGR resulted in a linear decrease in plant height and shoot dry matter production. However, the rates of the growth regulator did not affect productivity. The rates of N influenced the yield only in 2011.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18603/19416,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Estimating chlorophyll content from Eucalyptus dunnii leaves by reflectance values,"This study aimed to estimate photosynthetic pigments contents from leaves of Eucalyptus dunni Maiden based on values of reflectance spectra of red, green and blue colors obtained with a digital color analyzer. We collected fifty leaves from the lower third of the crown of twenty trees including young as well as mature leaves. From each leaf an area of 14 cm2 of the leaf blade was cut in which we measured reflectance values on the red, green and blue spectra with a portable digital colorimeter, obtained relative index of chlorophyll with a SPAD – 502 and determined the content of the chlorophyll a, b, and a + b by classic method of solvent extraction. We submitted the data to multiple linear regression and nonlinear analysis at 5% of error probability. It was evaluated the occurrence of multicollinearity. The negative exponential model resulted in good fit when data from red spectrum was used for chlorophyll a, green spectrum for chlorophyll b and a + b, making possible correlation coefficients between the estimated values and the extracted above 0.85. Except for the chlorophyll a content, the accuracy in estimates of photosynthetic pigments were higher than estimated by the chlorophyll meter, even with linearity between methods. Therefore, it is possible to estimate photosynthetic pigments on E. dunni leaves through values of red and green wavelengths from a digital color analyser.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21371/18970,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In total, 168 healthy Senepol (n = 80, 28 females and 52 males) and crossbred Holstein x Gir (n = 88, 49 females and 39 males) calves were evaluated. From each animal, approximately 5 mL of blood was collected by jugular venipuncture into a sterile tube without anticoagulant to obtain serum. Serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, and phosphorus; and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were determined on a automated multichannel analyzer. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in serum concentrations for total protein, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio (A:G), creatinine, urea, phosphorus, calcium/phosphorus ratio (Ca:P), AST, and GGT between Senepol calves and crossbred Holstein x Gir calves, but no significant differences in serum concentrations were observed between male and female calves for either breed (p > 0.05). It was concluded that the serum biochemistry profile of newborn Senepol and crossbred Holstein x Gir calves was affected by differences in colostrum intake management and breed characteristics. Also, no differences in blood parameters were observed between male and female calves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20372/19029,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Sperm motility, fertilization, and larval development of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) in copper-contaminated water","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of copper-contaminated water on sperm motility, fertilization, and embryonic and larval development of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). A randomized experimental design with five treatments and four replicates was used. Two experiments were carried out: (1) controlled fertilization was performed under different levels of copper contamination and egg hatching was performed in clean water; and (2) copper-contaminated water was used for both fertilization and hatching assays. The time of sperm motility and sperm motility rates linearly decreased with increasing copper concentration in the water. Fertilization and hatching rates were also affected when the concentrations of copper in the water were above 0.0979 mg Cu+2 L-1 and 0.0331 mg Cu+2 L-1, respectively. Gamete exposure to levels between 15 mg Cu+2 L-1 and 60 mg Cu+2 L-1 for short periods of time negatively affected sperm motility, oocyte fertilization, and egg hatching rates. In addition, when gametes and embryos were exposed at levels above 0.03 mg Cu+2 L-1 during long periods of time, egg hatching rates were reduced, and at levels between 0.05 mg Cu+2 L-1 and 0.20 mg Cu+2 L-1 the number of abnormal larvae increased.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22327/19050,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Nitrogen fertilization for wheat growing in dual purpose integrated system of agricultural production,"Nowadays, there are numerous arrangements of Integrated Systems of Agricultural Production, due, the particularities of each region and/or rural enterprise. The use of dual-purpose species such as, for example, BRS Tarumã® wheat further intensifies the system, because there is plant-animal production in a short time. Study aimed to evaluate the production and chemical composition of dual purpose wheat pastures managed with different DAN during periods of spikelet terminal (ST) and anthesis (AN), aiming crop production (pasture and grain) and animal (milk and / or meat). The experimental randomized block design with five treatments (0, 75, 150, 225 e 300 Kg de N ha-1, in the form of ammonium nitrate) and four replications. The average biomass values before the first and the second grazing were respectively: 2,164 and 2,127 kg DM per hectare and the waste of about 824 and 1,772 kg of DM per hectare and the daily average accumulation rate between the two grazing DM was 86 kg per hectare at 17 day intervals. The variables, number of spikes per square meter, grain number per square meter, thousand grain weight, hectoliter weight and grain yield did not differ (P>0.05) between treatments. Nitrogen fertilization increases linearly (P=0.0017) the size of the spikes depending on nitrogen rates. For the linear variable layering increased (P=0.0001), indicating the susceptibility of the crop to high levels of nitrogen. The application of nitrogen fertilizer levels in dual purpose grazed wheat before the spikelet terminal stage and anthesis does not influence on grain yield variables. The nitrogen fertilization on wheat double purpose must be fractionated at tillering and after each grazing increasing the remobilization rate of nitrogen by culture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23758/19085,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Apparent digestibility of nutrients and energy of conventional ingredients for the silver mojarra, Diapterus rhombeus","Knowledge on the nutritional value of feed ingredient is an important step in the formulation of diets in order to maximize animal productivity. Thus a study was conducted to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter (ADCDM), crude protein (ADCCP), gross energy (ADCGE) and amino acids (ADCAA) of conventional feed ingredients for juvenile silver mojarra (13.0 ± 3.23 g). The study was conducted in the laboratory for nutrition and feeding of fish (AQUANUT), using 80 silver mojarra collected in nature, which were kept in digestibility aquaria for a period of 21 days. The following ingredients were evaluated: fish meal, soybean meal, corn meal, corn gluten meal, rice bran, wheat bran and starch, which substituted 30% of a reference pelletized diet with 325.00 g kg-1 crude protein and 3,692 Kcal kg-1 gross energy. Additionally 1.0 g kg-1 chrome oxide was added to each diet as a marker. The excreta were obtained using three repetitions for each tested ingredient, which were dried for further analyses. The soybean meal showed the best ADCDM value (67.45%), followed by the other ingredients. There was no significant difference between the soybean meal (95.16%), fish meal (92.97%) and the corn meal (91.90%) for the best ADCCP coefficients. The ADCGE for soybean meal and maize meal were 65.23% and 60.31%, respectively, followed by fish meal (51.85%). The results demonstrate that silver mojarra can digest animal protein as well as that of vegetal origin. Silver mojarra can also efficiently digest and absorb some of the main amino acids of fish, such as lysine, methionine and threonine, from the same studied ingredients.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22066/19049,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Cryopreservation of Prochilodus brevis semen: freezing media and thawing rates,"Prochilodus brevis is a migratory fish, an important component of its river ecosystem and an appreciated animal in northeastern cuisine. However, human activities have threatened its survival. Thus, researchers have become interested in developing genetic material storage protocols, such as seminal cryopreservation. Therefore, determination of the appropriate freezing media and thawing rate is a fundamental step toward the use of this biotechnology in the production of common curimatã and for reducing risks to the species’ survival. As such, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of different freezing media and thawing rates on the quality of cryopreserved semen from P. brevis. For this study, males received a single dose of pituitary extract of carp 18 hours before semen collection. The semen samples were diluted in 5% glucose + 10% methyl glycol (MG), 5% glucose + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.9% NaCl + 10% methyl glycol, and 0.9% NaCl + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, loaded into 0.25-mL straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor. The semen from each treatment was thawed at three different thawing rates: 25 °C for 30 sec, 30 °C for 16 sec and 40 °C for 12 sec. Motility, vitality and morphology analyses were performed by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). The characteristics of the fresh sperm mostly resembled those found in the literature. For the parameters analyzed, fresh sperm presented higher sperm quality in comparison to all treatments with cryopreserved sperm (p < 0.05), except for the characteristic of normal morphology, for which the sperm cryopreserved in glucose and MG did not differ statistically from the fresh sperm. For the cryopreserved semen, the greatest results of total motility and curvilinear velocity (VCL) were obtained using glucose and DMSO, regardless of the thawing rate employed. For the straight-line velocity (VSL) and average path velocity (VAP), DMSO showed the best results, regardless of the diluent and thawing rate. With regard to vitality, the highest values were achieved when DMSO and thawing rates of 30 °C for 16 sec or 40 °C for 12 sec were used. In the morphological analysis, the greatest percentage of normal sperm cells was obtained using thawing rates of 25 °C for 30 sec and 40 °C for 12 sec, regardless of the freezing media. Sperm quality was found to suffer interference from the freezing media, as well as from interaction between its components (diluent and cryoprotectant) and the thawing rate used. Under the methodological conditions employed, the use of 5% glucose + 10% DMSO and a thawing rate of 30 °C for 16 seconds or 40 °C for 12 seconds is recommended for P. brevis semen cryopreservation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22003/19048,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Feeding behavior of lambs fed diets containing peach palm meal,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feeding behavior of lambs fed diets containing peach palm meal replacing maize (0, 10, 40, 60, and 85% DM). Thirty Santa Inês sheep with an average initial body weight of 21.6 ± 0.87 kg were distributed in a completely randomized design with five diets and six replicates. Feeding time in min kg–1 DM and min kg–1 NDFap increased by 34 min and 99.6 min, respectively, with each level of substitution of maize for the peach palm meal. Rumination and chewing times, in min kg–1 DM and min kg–1 NDF, also increased in response to the substitution of maize for peach palm meal. When expressed in min day–1, rumination and chewing activities decreased by 12.4 and 14.6 min, respectively, as the amount of peach palm meal in the concentrate was increased. The time spent idle increased linearly (P < 0.05), by 14.6 min day–1, with the replacement levels, compared with the control diet. Peach palm meal in the composition of sheep diets reduces the intakes of dry matter and fiber and decreases the feed and rumination efficiencies. Replacing maize by peach palm meal increases the feeding time and rumination and chewing activities of feedlot lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21936/19047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Sensory evaluation of beef and buffalo extensively reared and its relationship to sociodemographic characteristics of consumers,"Sensory characteristics of meat from different animal types, including cattle (Angus and Brangus) and buffalo raised at pasture, and information on socio-demographic determinants of consumer preference were evaluated. Samples of roasted rib eye were cut and served in a disordered and monadic manner to 188 untrained tasters. A nine-point hedonic scale was used to assess odor, color, tenderness, succulence and overall appearance. Analysis of variance was carried out using the GLM procedure of SAS®, considering animal type and socio-demographic characteristics as fixed effects and using the LSMEANS procedure for multiple mean comparisons. Differences (P < 0.001) between animal types were observed only for tenderness, with Brangus (7.02) and buffalo (6.82) meat being superior to Angus (6.25). Regardless of meat origin, age, income, smoking and place of purchase affected the perceived attributes (P < 0.05). People aged over 50 years gave higher mean scores for odor and color (P < 0.05), indicative of greater satisfaction and less demanding tastes when compared to other age categories. Despite the variability in the intrinsic characteristics, differentiation of meat by the consumer is not easy to determine, with little impact of sociodemographic characteristics on organoleptic perception. Meat from Brangus cattle and buffaloes raised at pasture was considered tenderer than that from Angus cattle raised under the same conditions by an untrained taste panel compared with.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21770/19046,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment was conducted at UTFPR Câmpus Dois Vizinhos in the period between October 2011 and July 2012, a 600 m² area. The treatments were: TMI - single corn, TMT - corn and grass Tanzania consortium at the time of sowing, TT - Tanzania grass single, TT32 - grass Tanzania silage to 32% dry matter (content similar to that of corn). The experimental design a randomized block design with four treatments and five replications. Agronomic evaluations were performed 120 days after planting, as follows: number of linear-1 plants metro, plant height and ear insertion and number of ears.plants-1. In the grass we evaluated canopy height, where it was held the botanical separation in green leaves, dried and stem. Silage started being held in 100 mm PVC pipe (mini-silos) kept sealed for 60 days. At the time of opening of the silo were determined the following parameters: DM, pH, total loss of DM (PDM), specifies mass (SM), dry matter recovery indices (IRDM), losses gas (LG), and size particle. Chemical analysis of the results of OM, MM, ADF were higher for TMI treatments, TT and TT, respectively. CP and LIG had superior results for the treatments containing grass. Corn intercropping with grass Tanzania silage provides more crude protein and lignin compared to exclusive corn silage without damaging the crop yield. Silage maiden Tanzania has higher levels of ADF and crude protein as well as increased production of dry matter than corn silage. The grass Tanzania should be harvested with 30% DM as presented better pH values, higher dry matter recovery rate, less loss of gas as well as increased production of dry matter that Tanzania harvested at the same age corn.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21765/19084,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Forty Santa Inês crossbred sheep with an average initial weight of 18.85 ± 2.80 kg and an average age of 5.0 ± 2.0 months were distributed in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement composed of two proportions of roughage and concentrate (30:70 and 70:30) and two levels of water supply (ad libitum, and 50% restriction), with 10 replicates. Water restriction had a negative effect (P0.05) feed conversion or feed conversion. Total weight gain, average daily gain, feed conversion, and feed efficiency were influenced by the proportions of roughage and concentrate. In conclusion, the diet with 70% roughage, associated with a water restriction of 50%, reduced the uptake of energy and protein, compromising the animal performance. The combination of the diet plus concentrate and water restricted to 50% of the free consumption provides a better cost-benefit ratio.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21743/19044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Impact of body condition on postpartum features in morada nova sheep,"This study evaluated the impact of nutritional status of Morada Nova sheep at lambing on the reproductive and productive performance and on the survival of lambs in early weaning system. Nineteen, Morada Nova sheep were assigned to two groups according to body condition score (BCS) at lambing: low BCS (n = 11) and high BCS (n=8) with body condition respectively of (mean ± SD) 2.0 ± 0.3 e 2.9 ± 0.1. From birth until lamb weaning (45 days), sheep were weighed weekly and checked the BCS, loin subcutaneous fat thickness, loin depth, hematological profile, milk composition and production, and every three days, we measured the uterine diameter. Lamb weightings were performed up to one week after weaning (52 days). The lower availability of muscle and fat reserves in the low BCS group negatively affected milk production and consequently performance of suckling lambs. However, the results indicated that the uterine involution process, the reproductive parameters including prolificacy, rate of multiple births, number of white blood cells, milk quality, body weight of lambs at birth and mortality rates were not affected by the body condition. The results allowed to describe the responsiveness to opposite nutritional status of Morada Nova sheep, showing their characteristics of adaptation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21699/19043,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In this diverse environment, some of the difficulties can be minimised through the grouping of production units through the study of typology. The objective was to characterise the systems of milk production from West Parana State by considering production rates, area, power, facilities, and marketing of milk. To this end, 735 semi-structured interviews with dairy farmers were performed by using a questionnaire for management practices and feed that is used on the farms. To obtain the explanatory variables used for principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), a homogeneous division of 735 farmers in five groups was used. Ten per cent of producers were randomly selected for the performance of field visits to the properties, where a new questionnaire was applied with specific points regarding feeding management on the property, and feed was collected to determine its composition. The collected data were tabulated and feed was ranked based on the classification proposed by the NRC (2001). Analyses of feed were carried out in the Laboratory of Animal Nutrition of Unioeste. The West Parana State has five groups of dairy production systems. There is great variability in the fresh forages that are used, but maize silage is the main forage utilised for fermented feed, and concentrate supplementation is adopted by more than 60% of farms during both seasons.

Regarding the quality of the eggs, the percentage of yolk and albumen, shell thickness and Haugh unit were not affected by the different diets. The percentage of shell, specific gravity and albumen height showed significant differences. We found that supplementation of only one amino acid in the diet (T7, T8 or T9), with the exception of methionine (T6), worsened performance relative to the control. Supplementation of three amino acids (methionine, lysine and threonine; T5) or four amino acids (methionine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan; T4) worsened egg production and conversion per mass and per dozen eggs; however, feed intake and egg weight and mass were similar to the control treatment. When all amino acids (methionine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine and valine; T2) were supplemented performance was similar to the control treatment in all variables. Supplementation of methionine, lysine and threonine is essential for birds in the laying phase; however the addition of six essential amino acids (lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and isoleucine) to the diet of laying hens is important for a good productive performance comparable with the control treatment T1. However, the inclusion of the latter two (isoleucine and valine) is justified only if the production cost is lower.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21504/19083,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Supplementation of grazing suckling beef calves receiving different energy sources,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different energy sources - corn, sorghum, and wheat bran - on performance, intake, digestibility, and nitrogen utilization efficiency of beef calves subjected to creep feeding. Thirty-four calves (12 males and 22 females) with initial age and weight of four months and 108±3.9 kg, respectively, were used in a randomized-block experimental design with four treatments and two blocks (males and females). Treatments were control (MM), a mineral mixture ad libitum; corn (C); corn + sorghum (C+S); and corn + sorghum + wheat bran (C+S+WB). Supplements contained approximately 20% crude protein (CP), and were fed in the amount of 0.5% of body weight. Supplemented animals had higher performance (P < 0.05) when compared with those on treatment MM. Supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (NDFap), non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), digestible neutral detergent fiber (dNDF), and digestible organic matter (dOM). The digestibility of NFC was higher (P < 0.05) in the supplemented treatments. The C+S and C+S+WB treatments provided increased digestibility (P < 0.05) of OM, CP, and NDFap. The synthesis of nitrogen compounds was higher (P < 0.05) in animals on treatment C as compared with those on the other supplemented treatments. Animals on treatments C+S and C+S+WB had higher (P < 0.05) nitrogen utilization efficiency compared with those on the other treatments. Concentrate supplementation improved the animal performance. The use of other energy sources (sorghum or wheat bran) in association with corn is recommended for suckling calves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21500/19039,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Meat quality of castrated and non-castrated Santa Ines lambs subjected to food restriction,"This study aimed to evaluate the quality of meat of castrated and non-castrated Santa Ines lambs submitted to food restriction. Were used 30 lambs, 15 castrated and 15 non-castrated, about two months of age and average initial body weight of 13.00 ± 1.49 kg. The lambs were distributed in a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (restriction level x sex class), according to the amount of food provided. The duration of the experiment was determined by the time required for the animals in the one of the groups achieved 28 kg of body weight. There was interaction between food restriction levels and sex class to the variables intensity of yellow color and pH in the longissimus lumborum muscle and the shear force in the semimembranosus muscle. In non-castrated animals, the intensity of yellow color was higher in the longissimus lumborum muscle at the level of 30% of food restriction. There was no significant interaction between food restriction levels and sex class for the quality aspects related to color saturation, color tone, luminosity, red intensity, water holding capacity and cooking losses in longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus muscles. Although food restriction and sex class have influenced the variables related to the quality of meat of the animals evaluated, the mean values are considered acceptable by the literature. The feeding restriction levels and sex class influence some important features of quality of Santa Ines lamb meat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21174/19038,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Forage mass, chemical composition and leaf chlorophyll index of signal grass and organic matter in soil under increasing levels of nitrogen","This study evaluated the forage mass, plant height, chemical composition and chlorophyll index of signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk), as well as the content of organic matter (OM) in soil under increasing levels of nitrogen. The experiment was conducted in the Rio Manso Farm, experimental unit of the Federal University of the Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys - UFVJM in the municipality of Couto de Magalhães de Minas, state of Minas Gerais. For plant evaluation, we use a split plot randomized block design with four replications. Nitrogen levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 kg ha-1 N) were assigned to plots and the cuts made in plants, to subplots. For the assessment of soil organic matter, we used a split-split-plot, with nitrogen levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha-1 by cut) in the plots, collection depth (0-10 and 10-20 cm) in the subplots and three sampling times (before the onset of the experiment, at the end of the 1st crop year and at the end of the 2nd crop year) in sub-subplots in a randomized block design with four replications. It can be concluded that nitrogen fertilization linearly increases forage mass, plant height and crude protein content of signal grass, which are positively correlated with chlorophyll index. At the end of two agricultural years, the content of organic matter in the soil decreases, which can be attributed to management of cutting and removal of the cut material.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20450/19089,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of concentrate supplementation during pre-kidding on the productive and reproductive performance of goats raised on Guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv. Tobiatã) pasture,"Sixty goats (20 Alpine, 18 Anglo-Nubian, and 22 crossbred Boer), with average body weight 49.33 ± 1.41 kg, were raised on Panicum maximum cv. Tobiatã pasture with two different levels of concentrate supplementation, 300 (SL30) and 600 g kg-1 (SL60) of the daily requirements, and evaluated from the pre-mating season until an average of 110 days of lactation. Milk controls were performed every 14 days. The following milk production curve parameters were estimated: time to reach peak milk production (TP), peak milk production (PP) and milk production during the first 110 days of lactation (MP). The following milk components were determined: fat, protein, lactose, total solids (TS), defatted dry extract (DDE), urea nitrogen (UN) concentrations, and somatic cell count (SCC). Goat prolificacy and birth weight of the kids were also determined. Breed affected the lactation curve, with Alpine and Anglo- Nubian goats presenting higher TP, PP, and MP. Protein, TS, and DDE concentrations were also affected by breed, being higher for crossbred Boer goats. Milk fat, lactose concentrations, and the log of SCC were affected by the concentrate supplementation level, being higher for SL30, as well as by the breed, with crossbred Boer goats presenting higher fat concentrations and log of SCC, and crossbred Boer and Alpine goats presenting higher lactose concentrations. UN was affected by the stage of lactation. Prolificacy and birth weight were affected by breed and concentrate supplementation level, being higher for Anglo-Nubian and crossbred Boer goats with SL60. Kids from single births presented higher birth weights. The Anglo-Nubian breed presented good milk production and the best body condition, which might indicate the effectiveness of this production system, SL60 supplementation resulted in higher birth weight and prolificacy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18636/19036,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Characteristics of cattle breeders and dairy production in the southeastern and northeastern mesoregions of Pará state, Brazil","The objective of this study was to characterize the dairy production systems of the southeastern and northeastern mesoregions of Pará state. A total of 112 questionnaires were administered on rural properties with dairy cow milk production in the municipalities of Ulianópolis and Irituia from April to May 2013. The activity was conducted mainly by men between 36 and 70 years of age. The education level was low, with 67% of the cattle breeders having incomplete basic education and 20.5% being illiterate. Regarding herd feeding, only 19.6% of the breeders used energy supplements, and 13.39% used roughage supplements. Sanitation control was performed by 99.1% of the breeders, with vaccines against foot and mouth disease and brucellosis being the most common vaccines because they are mandatory. Milking was performed manually on 98.2% of the properties, and pre-dipping and post-dipping techniques were used on only 2.7% and 3.6% of the properties, respectively. Regarding management, 84.8% of the breeders did not perform financial planning, and 99.1% did not have a defined chart of accounts and cost centres and were unaware of their production costs. Average herd productivity was 4.34 L cow-1 day-1, with average production varying between 30 L day-1 in units with fewer than 10 lactating cows and 355 L day-1 in those with over 55 cows.

37,2016,Feeding behavior of lambs fed castor meal,"The experiment aimed to evaluate the feeding behavior of Santa Inês lambs fed diets containing different levels of detoxified castor meal in the concentrate. Twenty-four sheep with an average body weight of 18.5± 2.26 kg, at four months of age, were distributed in a randomized complete design with four treatment and six replications. Treatments consisted of four levels of castor meal (0, 33, 67, and 100%) replacing soybean meal. Animals underwent a 15-day adaptation period and an experimental period of 84 days. The diet was composed of 60% sugarcane silage and 40% concentrate, on a dry matter basis. Animal behavior (idle, rumination, and feeding activities) were observed visually for two 24-h periods with 5-min intervals, and recorded. The number of rumination chews and the time taken to ruminate each cud per day were counted using a digital stopwatch. Dry matter (DM) intake was not affected by inclusion of castor meal in the concentrate, averaging 884.02 g day?1. The feeding activity was not affected by addition of castor meal. Rumination time increased linearly, whereas the idle and rumination times decreased linearly with addition of castor meal. Feeding time, expressed in min per kg of DM and NDF, was not influenced by the inclusion of the meal in the diet, averaging 373.3 and 880.0 min, respectively. The number of chews and the time taken to ruminate each cud were not changed by inclusion of castor meal in the diet. Feed efficiency, expressed in grams DM and NDF per hour, was not influenced by castor meal inclusion in the diet. Rumination efficiency expressed in g DM h?1 decreased, but was not affected when expressed in g NDF h?1. Total replacement of soybean meal by castor meal in the concentrate does not affect the feeding time or feed efficiency of feedlot sheep, but leads to a small reduction of their rumination efficiency. Thus, we recommend the inclusion of castor meal in sheep diets at the levels tested in this study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18251/19033,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Biofertilizer in the nutritional quality of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.),"The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in the nutritional composition to the application of biofertilizers. The experiment was conducted with increasing doses of biofertilizers in a greenhouse at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine / UNESP, Araçatuba - Sao Paulo, Brazil, from April to October 2010. The experimental design was completely randomized with six biofertilizer doses from cattle manure (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m3 ha-1) and five replications. Cuts were performed, on average, every 27 days, 10 cm above the ground when 10% of the plants were flowering. Biofertilization had a positive significant impact on foliar nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and shoot iron concentrations. The values of crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber did not differ between doses of biofertilizers. Biofertilization is a viable alternative for nutrition of this species, showing positive results in the nutritional composition of alfalfa.

37,2016,"Neospora spp. and Toxoplasma gondii infection in sheep flocks from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii are coccidian parasites (protozoa: Apicomplexa) that cause reproductive losses in ruminants. Although, in sheep, abortion is generally related to T. gondii, potential damage caused by N. caninum must be considered. The aims of this study were to evaluate the frequencies of antibodies against Neospora spp. and T. gondii, and to identify the risk factors related to neosporosis and toxoplasmosis in sheep from ten flocks located in Central-Western, Northwestern, Southwestern, and Southeastern mesoregions of the Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 300 sheep (30 per flock) and an epidemiological questionnaire was completed by the farmers. The presence of canids, felids, and rodents, the sources of water for the animals, and their reproductive history were investigated as potential epidemiological factors related to the studied infections. Serum samples were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test for the presence of antibodies against Neospora spp. (cutoff 1:50) and T. gondii (cutoff 1:64), with respective frequencies detected being 16.3% (49/300) and 41.3% (124/300). Seropositivity to both parasites was observed in 8% (24/300) of the animals. Neospora spp. and T. gondii were present in 90% (9/10) and 100% (10/10) of the flocks, respectively. The presence of cats in the pastures, pens, and barns was significantly associated (p=0.047) with high frequencies (53.3% to 70%) of antibodies against T. gondii in the flocks. However, no associations were detected (p>0.05) between each of the other risk factors and the frequency of antibodies against Neospora spp. or T. gondii. Results of this study showed a broad distribution of both protozoa in evaluated sheep flocks.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21795/19081,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Cryopreservation protocol for equine platelet-rich plasma,"In this preliminary study, a new equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) cryopreservation protocol was evaluated. PRP was obtained by a double centrifugation technique of whole blood collected from 8 adult healthy ponies. A fresh sample of PRP was analyzed for total platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet morphology. Upon morphological evaluation, 200 platelets were counted using a differential interference contrast microscope with a 40x phase objective and classified as activated (with pseudopodia), inactivated (normal discoid shape), or uncertain state (spherical shape, without pseudopodia). Two other PRP samples, one containing DMSO as a cryoprotectant and the other without DMSO, were stored in a mechanical freezer at –80ºC. After 14 days, the frozen samples were thawed and submitted to the same analysis as described above. The fresh PRP showed a platelet count of 830 (±95.3) x103 uL-1, an MPV of 5.2 (±0.07) fL, and composed of 4% activated platelets. There was no significant difference in platelet count, MPV, and activated platelets between fresh and 6% DMSO frozen PRP samples (617.9±65.5x103uL-1; 5.3±0.06fL; 9.5%) (p > 0.05). On the other hand, samples frozen without DMSO showed a significantly lower platelet count (519.6±66.1x103uL-1), higher MPV (5.7±0.08fL), and more activated platelets (13.9%) than the other groups (p < 0.05). The 6% DMSO was able to preserve platelet morphology in PRP stored at –80oC for 14 days, but studies on platelet function of thawed PRP are still needed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21777/19027,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Detection of Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus infection in newborn calves before colostrum intake,"The detection of Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection, especially among persistently infected calves (PI), should be performed earlier in order to eliminate the source of the infection and to prevent the spread of the disease in the herd. However, colostrum intake can influence the results of some of the tests used to diagnose the BVDV infection. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficacy of serum neutralization (SN) test in conjunction with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of BVDV infection before colostrum intake. The deliveries of the animals were assisted to select 52 newborn Holstein calves for inclusion in the study. Initially, the whole blood and serum samples were collected from the calves before (T0) and after (T1) the colostrum intake. The calves that were RT-PCR positive at any of the time-points were retested on the 30th day post birth (T2). The presence of specific antibodies for BVDV was evaluated by SN, and that of viral RNA by the RT-PCR. The BVDV-specific antibodies were observed in the serum of 13.46% (7/52) of the calves at T0 because of fetal infection. At T1, seroconversion was observed in 100% (52/52) of the calves. The geometric mean titers (GMT) of the antibodies for BVDV increased significantly from T0 (14.52) to T1 (2490) (P = 0.0001). Of the four calves that were RT-PCR positive before colostrum intake (T0), two were seronegative and two, seropositive. Of the forty-eight RT-PCR negative calves, five were seropositive. After 30 days post birth, all of the animals tested negative by RT-PCR, thus excluding the possibility of persistent infection. The association observed between the results of the SN and RT-PCR assays at T0 (P = 0.025) could not be observed at T1 (P > 0.05). The SN test before the colostrum intake allowed the detection of fetal infection in the herd; however, this test was ineffective as a diagnostic method after the transfer of passive immunity. The confirmation of the results of the SN assay by those of the RT-PCR was essential for the identification of the infected calves before colostrum intake.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21732/19078,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Morphogenesis in pastures of Coastcross-1 and Tifton 85 mixed with forage peanut, submitted to cutting management","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence of forage peanut (Arachis pintoi Krap. and Greg.) on the morphogenesis characteristics of two cultivars of Cynodon (Tifton 85 and Coastcross-1). The experimental design was factorial (three factors), in randomized blocks, having as factors the cultivars (2), the occupancy area of forage peanut (4) and the seasons (3), with three replications, established in plots. There were three assessments during the study, in spring, summer and autumn, in which the total number of tillers, the culm and leaf elongation, the senescence rate and leaf emergence, the phyllochron, the leaf lifespan, the leaf number and the height of culm and canopy were evaluated. The number of green leaves, number of elongating leaves and senescence rate were similar among cultivars, but cv. Coastcross-1 showed higher number of expanded leaves and leaf emergence rate, and lower phyllochron and leaf lifespan. We observed lower rates of senescence and higher leaf emergence in spring, and lower rates of leaf elongation in autumn. The increasing participation of forage peanut in the pastures did not affect the calculated morphogenetic variables, but decreased the number of grass tillers. A lower average daily thermal accumulation decreased the development of both grasses in this study, with a more pronounced effect in cv. Tifton 85. The Coastcross-1 cultivar has higher elongation rate and leaf emergence, coupled with lower phyllochron and leaf lifespan, indicating a need for shorter rest periods when compared to cv. Tifton 85.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18320/19034,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in dogs residents in two different environments, they are: recycling of solid waste centers (Group 1) and a neighborhood adjacent to a forest (Group 2), both in Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil and to determine epidemiological variables associated to infection in these different realities. Serum samples, randomly collected, from 61 dogs from Group 1 and from 74 dogs from Group 2 were submitted to Indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) to research for anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies. Of the 135 dogs analyzed, 13 animals (9.6%) were positive; nine (14.7%) in Group 1 and four (5.4%) in Group 2, the difference between the groups is not statistically significant. These results suggest the presence of the protozoan Leishmania spp. in both environments studied which indicate potential for infection in the human population.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22721/19028,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Mesenchymal stem cells promote augmented response of endogenous neural stem cells in spinal cord injury of rats,"Traumatic spinal cord injury results in severe neurological deficits, mostly irreversible. The cell therapy represents a strategy for treatment particularly with the use of stem cells with satisfactory results in several experimental models. The aim of the study was to compare the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) with and without mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), to investigate whether MSCs migrate and/or remain at the site of injury, and to analyze the effects of MSCs on inflammation, astrocytic reactivity and activation of endogenous stem cells. Three hours after SCI, animals received bone marrow-derived MSCs (1×107 in 1mL PBS, IV). Animals were euthanized 24 hours, 7 and 21 days post-injury. The MSC were not present in the site of the lesion and the immunofluorescent evaluation showed significant attenuation of inflammatory response with reduction in macrophages labeled with anti-CD68 antibody (ED1), decreased immunoreactivity of astrocytes (GFAP+) and greater activation of endogenous stem cells (nestin+) in the treated groups. Therefore, cell transplantation have a positive effect on recovery from traumatic spinal cord injury possibly due to the potential of MSCs to attenuate the immune response.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21596/19077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Bacteria isolated from abscesses of small ruminants inspected in the semiarid region of Brazil,"Loss in the supply chain of small ruminants owing to condemnations of carcasses in the abattoirs and slaughterhouses is common in northeastern Brazil. This study aims to identify bacterial agents, including Mycobacterium spp., in the abscesses found in the postmortem analysis of the carcasses of sheep and goats bred in northeastern Brazil. Our analysis involved 679 goats and 1,838 sheep carcasses. Abscess samples were extracted and inoculated on blood agar and Lowenstein Jensen with pyruvate or glycerol for bacterial isolation. We then performed polymerase chain reaction of the hps 65 gene; samples positive for Mycobacterium spp. were subjected to DNA sequencing. Relative frequencies of abscesses in goats and sheep were 5.44 and 3.26%, respectively. Microbiological analysis revealed 87.7% bacterial growth in the inoculated samples. Among these, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis represented 67.7% of the isolates. We observed 1.9% mycobacteria growth in the abscess samples inoculated on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. PCR of DNA extracted from abscesses samples showed amplification of 0.9% of samples. After sequencing, Mycobacterium spp. isolate was identified as M. novocastrense. C. pseudotuberculosis was the main agent responsible for the formation of abscesses in the examined animals, and we did not identify any species of the M. tuberculosis complex in the examined small ruminants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21508/18977,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Weight gain, behavioral and cortisol changes after orchiectomy with or without local anaesthesia in piglets","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intratesticular local anesthesia on weight gain and behavioral and cortisol changes in piglets submitted to castration. Study design was a randomized controlled trial. Twenty-nine male Landrace crossbred piglets aged 3 to 6 days were used. The piglets were randomly divided into two groups: orchiectomy with anesthesia (A, n = 15) and orchiectomy without anesthesia (NOA, n = 14). Piglets in the A and NOA groups were treated with 0.5 mL of intratesticular 2% lidocaine with a vasoconstrictor in each testicle and 0.5 mL of intratesticular 0.9% sodium chloride, respectively. Blood samples were collected from all animals immediately after surgery and at 3 and 6 days postoperatively for measurement of the serum cortisol concentration. Behavior was assessed daily for 6 days by two observers blinded to the treatment. Weight was measured at the same time as cortisol measurement. Analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to investigate differences in time within and between the two groups. Mean times of six evaluations done for 90 minutes during 6 days of each behavior were compared by Tukey t test. The level of statistical significance was 5%. The serum cortisol concentration was higher immediately after surgery than at 3 and 6 days postoperatively in both groups. Weight gain was greater at 3 and 6 days postoperatively in the A group than in the NOA group. Intratesticular local anesthesia before castration in piglets is technically practical, is in accordance with good welfare practice, and improves short-term weight gain in piglets submitted to castration.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21241/19435,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Biomechanical evaluation of two extracapsular techniques for cranial cruciate ligament reconstruction in cadaver dogs,"Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) is one of the most important orthopedic conditions in dogs, leading to joint instability, pain, osteoarthritis and eventually to meniscal injuries. Several surgical techniques have been described to reestablish joint stability following CCLR, including extracapsular procedures. This study compared the biomechanical effects of two extracapsular stabilization techniques (lateral fabello-tibial suture – LFTS, and modified retinacular imbrication technique – MRIT) using nylon leader line following experimental CCLR in cadaver dogs. Twenty canine cadaveric stifles were used. Joint stiffness, cranial and caudal tibial displacement were evaluated in 4 different experimental scenarios: intact stifle, stifle with CCLR, CCLR treated with lateral fabello-tibial suture (LFTS), and CCLR treated with modified retinacular imbrication technique (MRIT). Results: Mean cranial tibial displacement increased progressively from intact to MRIT, LFTS and CCRL stifles. MRIT resulted in less caudal drawer motion than LFTS. Joint stiffness did not differ significantly between LFTS and MRIT treated stifles. Conclusion: LFTS and MRIT increase joint stability but MRIT is more effective; however none of the techniques studied was able to restore original intact stifle stiffness. Clinical implications of the results presented remain to be determined but kinetic gait analysis studies are warranted to determine whether this biomechanical advantage translates into improved hind limb function in dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21478/18976,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica isolates in fish species captured from the Lagoa dos Patos estuary,"Microorganisms that cause human diseases can contaminate fishes in aquatic environments as well as during their capture, handling, and transport. The purpose of this study was to isolate Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica from fishes captured in the Lagoa dos Patos estuary that were eviscerated and cleaned for trade. Thirteen fish landing were analyzed and 65 entire fishes and 65 cleaned fishes were studied to determine the presence of V. parahaemolyticus and S. enterica. Bacterial isolates were compared using rep-PCR. V. parahaemolyticus was isolated from one entire Micropogonias furnieri and two entire Mugil platanus, as well as from three eviscerated M. platanus. S. enterica was isolated from two eviscerated Paralichthys orbignyanus. Identical rep-PCR bands from V. parahaemolyticus were observed in entire and eviscerated fishes from the same discharge, suggesting processing failures that neither eliminated the microorganism from the raw material nor prevented cross-contamination. S. enterica was not isolated from entire fishes, presumably because contamination occurred due to hygiene and sanitary failures. Our results showed that M. furnieri and M. platanus captured in the Lagoa dos Patos estuary may host V. parahaemolyticus and that this microorganism, as with S. enterica, may also persist even after the fish is cleaned. This is the first record of the isolation of V. parahaemolyticus from M. furnieri.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21540/18978,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Barbatiman and chitosan creams as adjuvants in rabbit skin wound healing,"In this study, 5% barbatiman and 5% chitosan creams were evaluated as adjuvants in the tissue repair process by secondary intention of rabbit’s skin wounds. Four equidistant wounds were induced in the dorsal skin of 20 adult male rabbits, which were submitted to healing by secondary intention and treated with 5% chitosan cream (QC, n=5), 5% barbatiman cream (BC, n=5), 2% allantoin cream (n=5), and base cream (n=5). The creams were applied with the aid of disposable spatulas after washing the wounds. The wounds were daily analyzed by clinical examination for 21 days and histological analyses were performed on the 3rd, 14th, and 21st day after induction. The microscopic evaluation of the wounds of all groups showed macroscopic features of the healing process at different time intervals. The QC and BC treatments helped in the skin repair process in rabbits when compared to the other two treatments. They induced fibroblast activation and early collagen deposition, and modulated re-epithelialization and neovascularization. Thus, it was concluded that BC and QC are efficient and economically feasible as adjuvants in the healing process of skin wounds in rabbits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21276/18975,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Bovine mastitis: prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile and detection of genes associated with biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus,"Brazil currently ranks as one of the world leaders in food production and exportation. This scenario encourages the development of animal and plant health programs to ensure the production of safe food, helping the country to become an international provider of food for excellence. However, some health problems in dairy production, such as mastitis, have garnered increasing concern. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of bovine mastitis in select properties located in the western Santa Catarina region, to assess the susceptibility profile to antimicrobial agents used for treatment and to check for the presence of genes (icaA and icaD) associated with biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. In 148 milk samples collected, 72.97% had bacterial growth (n = 108). Among the isolated microorganisms, 21.62% (n = 32) were classified as Staphylococcus aureus, 18.91% (n = 28) as Staphylococcus sp. coagulase negative, 7.43% (n = 11) as Corynebacterium sp., 6.76% (n = 10) as Staphylococcus sp. coagulase positive, 5.41% (n = 8) as Nocardia sp. and 12.83% (n = 19) classified in different bacterial genera. Among the isolates submitted for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, it was observed that 8.95% (n = 6/67) had resistance to amoxicillin, 8.04% (n = 7/87) to ampicillin, 5.88% (n = 5/85) to cephalothin, 3.40% (n = 3/88) to ceftiofur and enrofloxacin, 20.45% (n = 18/88) to streptomycin, 17.04% (n = 15/88) to gentamicin and lincomycin, 31.81% (n = 28/88) to neomycin, 14.94% (n = 13/87) to penicillin and 25% (n = 22/88) to tetracycline. Staphylococcus sp. coagulase negative isolates showed higher multidrug resistance when compared to those of S. aureus and Staphylococcus sp. coagulase positive. Thirty-one strains of S. aureus isolates were genotypically tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), yielding a positive result for the icaA gene in 83.87% of the samples, 80.64% positive for icaD and 74.19% of these showed both genes. The results reinforce the importance of controlling this disease by adopting strict hygiene protocols and disinfection of equipment used for milking and the prescription of appropriate therapies to clinical and subclinical cases of mastitis, as well as evaluating not only the susceptibility profile of isolates but also the biofilm formation capacity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21700/18984,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Physicochemical properties and enzymatic bean grains dried at different temperatures and stored for 225 days,"Beans are an important food in the world and are present on the tables of Brazilians almost daily. The harvest of these grains occurs seasonally during the year, and hence, steps after harvesting are essential to maintain product demand. However, the drying and storage conditions may alter the characteristics of the beans, reducing their economic value and their acceptability to consumers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of storage time on the chemical, technological and enzymatic parameters of black beans dried at three temperatures (30, 45 and 60 °C) and stored for 225 days in conventional woven polypropylene bags. The results show that the increase in storage time leads to a lower protein solubility, and a decreased content of tannins, lipids and proteins; and an increased cooking time, fat acidity, and the enzymatic activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. These parameters are important in the quality control of beans for consumption and as a raw material for the food industry. The quantity of broken grains and the grain roughness index are only influenced by the drying temperature regardless of the storage time of 225 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21647/19053,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Rates of nitrogen from nitric and ammoniacal sources required by upland rice genotypes originating from Brazil and Colombia,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial growth, nitrogen (N) uptake, and agronomic efficiency after the use of N fertilizers in upland rice cultivation. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse by using pots filled with surface-layer (0 to 20 cm) soil collected from the municipality of Jaguapitã, Paraná. The experimental design was completely randomized with 4 replications. A factorial scheme of 5 × 2 was used, in which the factors were 5 N rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 kg ha-1 N) and 2 cultivars of rice (Fedearroz Lagunas [Colombian] and IAPAR- 9 [Brazilian]). The N sources tested were ammonium sulfate (Experiment I) and calcium nitrate (Experiment II). The following variables were evaluated: number of tillers per pot (NTP), dry mass of the shoots (DMS), N content in the dry mass (NCDM), and agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer (AEN). The data obtained in the experiments were evaluated using analysis of variance, and mean values were compared using Tukey’s test at 5% significance for rice cultivar effects or adjusted to polynomial regression equations for N rates. Use of calcium nitrate yielded higher values of NTP, NCDM, and AEN. The cultivar Lagunas showed higher NTP, while IAPAR-9 showed higher DMS. An increase in N rates, for both sources, resulted in the increase of NTP, DMS, and NCDM; however, AEN was decreased.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22887/18969,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Partial substitution of sodium chloride in Toscana sausages and the effect on product characteristics,"High sodium intake has been linked with problems of hypertension and in Brazil, it still has above that recommended by the World Health Organization. Meat products contribute 20–30% of sodium intake in the diet, indicating the necessity of reducing the amount of sodium added. The aim of this study was to reduce the sodium content in Toscana sausages by partial replacement of sodium chloride with PuraQ Arome NA4 substitute, and to evaluate the effect on physico-chemical and microbiological parameters and sensory acceptability. Three formulations – one control (T1), and one with 20% (T2) and another with 30% (T3) sodium reduction compared with the control – were produced. For comparative purposes, the physico-chemical, microbiological and sensory parameters were determined. In the proposed formulations with 20% and 30% reduction, the sodium contents were 857.3 mg 100 g-1 (T2) and 790.3 mg 100 g-1 (T3), compared with 926.7 mg 100 g-1 in T1. The produced samples were in accordance with the physico-chemical (moisture, lipid, protein and calcium) and microbiological (Salmonella, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, and sulphite-reducing Clostridium and Coliforms at 45°C) parameters stipulated by Brazilian law. The analysis of lightness and hue indicated that the sample T3 had a more intense red colour, while T1 had a less intense red colour. In the shear force evaluation, no difference was observed between the samples. The sample T2 was the most preferred in the ordering of preference test; however, in the hedonic scale, there was no difference between the means of sensory values for roast colour, aroma, texture, flavour and overall impression, indicating that all samples had adequate sensory acceptance. Acceptability levels were greater than 74.6% for all attributes evaluated in T1, T2 and T3.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20968/18971,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Selection of common bean land cultivars based on agronomic performance, cooking time, and mineral concentration","The potential use of common bean land cultivars with respect to their agronomic performance, cooking time and nutritional quality has scarcely been evaluated in breeding programs. The objective of the present study was to evaluate 19 common bean land cultivars for their agronomic traits, cooking time, and mineral concentration in grains to identify cultivars for potential use by a higher number of farmers or even breeding programs. Two field experiments were conducted in Alegrete and Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, in the 2012/2013 season. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with three replications. A total of 23 cultivars were evaluated; 19 land cultivars were obtained from smallholder farmers from RS, and there were four control cultivars (Carioca, Pérola, Valente, and Guapo Brilhante). The traits evaluated included the cycle, insertion of the first pod, grain yield, cooking time, and concentrations of calcium, iron, zinc, and copper in the grains. The data were subjected to joint variance analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and the Z index. The common bean cultivars showed differences in the cycle, insertion of the first pod, grain yield, cooking time, calcium, iron, zinc, and copper concentrations in grains, and the Z index. The cultivars Preto Miúdo and Cavalo Rajado had a high grain yield, i.e., greater than 2,900 kg ha-1. The land cultivars were classified as having early and intermediate cycles, and all had cooking times less than 30 min. Palha Roxa, Carioca Vermelho, and Perdiz had high concentrations of calcium, iron, zinc, and copper in the grains, an intermediate cycle, and low grain yield. Positive correlations of moderate magnitude were observed between the calcium and iron (r= 0.597), iron and zinc (r= 0.570), and zinc and copper (r= 0.548) concentrations. Indirect selection for high iron or zinc concentrations in grains will be effective for obtaining common bean cultivars with a higher nutritional quality. A cross between Carioca Santa Maria and Guapo Brilhante cultivar is recommended to obtain segregants with high agronomic performance, fast cooking, and high minerals concentration of in the grains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21702/18968,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Physiological, biochemical, and nutritional parameters of wheat treated with a fungicide and foliar fertilizer","Agronomic improvements in grain yield and quality of wheat crops could be obtained through the application of strategies, such as using foliar fungicides with fertilizers, to protect the leaves against pathogens and delay senescence during grain filling. However, few studies have reported the effect of these practices on wheat, although these treatments could represent a new method of increasing wheat production and profits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of foliar fertilizer, applied alone or in combination with a fungicide, on the photochemical, biochemical, and nutritional parameters of wheat plants. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions in a 2 × 3 factorial design (fungicide × foliar fertilizer) with four replications. The fungicide treatment used was azoxystrobin + cyproconazole + mineral oil; the control was left untreated. The foliar fertilizer was used at two different rates, and the control was not treated. Plants were sprayed at the GS29/GS30, GS45, and GS60 growth stages, and the plants were assessed ten days after the last spray. Chlorophyll a fluorescence, the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and electron transport rate were positively influenced by fertilizer. Fertilizer spraying significantly increased the leaf pigment content (chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids) and the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentration in flag leaves. When used in mixture, the fertilizer mitigates the stresses generated by the fungicide.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21672/18967,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Nutritional and biochemical changes induced by lead in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.),"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of increasing concentrations of lead (Pb) in the nutrient solution on growth and macronutrient and organic solute contents of Helianthus annuus plants. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. The dry mass yield was not affected by the treatments up to a Pb concentration of 0.6 mM, indicating that H. annuus was tolerant to this Pb concentration in the growth medium. The reductions in leaf, stem and root dry masses at a Pb concentration of 0.8 mM were 74, 84 and 85%, respectively. Lead stress did not reduce the levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), indicating that the growth reduction observed at 0.8 mM Pb could not be attributed to deficiencies of these nutrients. On the other hand, Pb significantly reduced calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) contents in leaves, stems and roots, which might, at least in part, explain the Pb-induced growth reduction in the H. annuus plants. Pb increased soluble carbohydrate, free amino acid and proline contents in leaves, and soluble protein and proline contents in roots, showing stress-induced changes in cell metabolism. The data also suggest that Ca and Mg concentrations may be used as nutritional indicators and the proline content may be used as a biochemical indicator of Pb toxicity in H. annuus.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21670/18966,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Soybean oversowing with Urochloa brizantha and Panicum maximum and the straw formation in a no-tillage system,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the soybean oversowing with braquiarão (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) and colonião (Panicum maximum cv. Aruana) and the capacity of these forage crops to produce dry mass during the fall-winter-spring period. Two experiments, one for each forage species, were conducted in field conditions in the 2011/2012 season and were repeated in 2012/2013. The experimental set-up was arranged in a randomized block design with four repetitions in a 2 x 5 factorial. The soybean oversowing was studied in the development stages R6 and R8 (2011/2012) or R5 and R8 (2012/2013) with braquiarão or colonião grass in five seed amounts (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 points of cultural value – PCV = seeds amount x culture value). In both seasons, the braquiarão oversowing at soybean stages R5 and R6 resulted in higher dry mass production, when compared to stage R8. Additionally, the amount of 600 seeds PCV was sufficient to obtain an excellent percentage of soil cover (>95%), in addition to the satisfactory number of plants per m2 and the dry mass production. On the other hand, independent of the soybean development stage in the oversowing moment, colonião was not promising for use in this sowing type because its low stand and irregular soil covering, even at the higher seed amounts.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21579/18964,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,High gamma irradiation doses and long storage times reduce soybean seed quality,"High quality seeds are required for soybean production. This study evaluated the effect of gamma irradiation and storage time on seed quality in soybean lines VX04-6828 and VX04-5692. Seeds were gamma irradiated (60Co) with 0, 50, 150, and 250 Gy. After the first seed production cycle (M1), the harvested seeds were stored in the laboratory for 0, 2, 4, and 6 months. Moisture content, seed quality (germination rate, dead seeds, and normal and abnormal seedlings), and seed vigor (first germination count, germination index, and seedling length) were determined. Data were submitted to analysis of variance for each soybean line using a 4 x 4 factorial design (four storage times x four gamma irradiation doses). Response surfaces were constructed based on the F test significance (p ? 0.05). VX04-5692 seeds were more sensitive to gamma radiation than were VX04-6828 seeds. Soybean seed quality was highest in M2 seeds derived from seeds irradiated with less than 100 Gy and stored for up to two months. High gamma irradiation doses and long storage times reduced soybean seed quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21658/18965,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Immobilization and nutrient uptake in ‘early isabella’ grapevines grafted on different rootstocks in organic management,"This study evaluated the immobilization and nutrient uptake in an experimental organic vineyard of ‘Early Isabella’ grapevines in the Midwestern region of Parana State, Brazil. The experimental design was implemented in randomized blocks with two different rootstocks ‘Paulsen 1103’ and ‘VR 043-43’ along with four replications and three plants per plot. Five years after planting, one plant per plot was completely removed from the soil and then subdivided into root, stem and canes. The remaining plants in the area were managed until harvest. The sectioned parts and clusters were dried in a forced air oven at 65°C. The dry mass was subsequently determined and mineral analyses were performed. The amounts of nutrient uptake immobilized by ‘Early Isabella’ grapevines with yields between 9.9 and 16.6 t ha-1 were 64.9, 19.0, 156.9, 45.8 and 12.7 kg ha –1 for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, respectively, when grafted on Paulsen ‘1103’ and 112.8, 29.3, 260.8, 82.3 and 26.0 kg ha-1, respectively, when grafted on ‘VR 043-43’.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21539/18972,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Determination of soil water tension for irrigation management of sweet sorghum,"Culturing of sweet sorghum is being considered as an excellent option for ethanol production, from an agronomical and industrial point of view. At present, information regarding the best soil water tension for beginning sweet sorghum irrigation is not available; hence, this study aimed to determine the adequate soil water tension under field conditions for beginning irrigation of four cultivars of sorghum. Two experiments were conducted at Nova Porteirinha, MG, in a randomized block design with sub-subdivided plots having four replications. Each experiment comprised six treatments of soil water tension (plots)-20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 kPa-for resuming sweet sorghum irrigation, and four sweet sorghum cultivars (subplots)-BRS 508, BRS 509, BRS 511, and CMSXS647. After planting, the soil water level in the plots was elevated to field capacity (10 kPa), and then the treatments were applied. During treatment application, irrigation was resumed when the soil water tension reached the limit established in order to elevate the soil water tension to 10 kPa. The amount of water replaced during each irrigation was determined by generating a soil water retention curve for the experimental area. The following parameters were evaluated: green mass production, juice volume, soluble solids (Brix), and tons of Brix per hectare (TBH). The different soil water tensions and cultivars, agricultural year, and interaction between tension and year significantly affected (p ? 0.05) the characteristics evaluated, according to the F test. The agronomical characteristics of the evaluated cultivars showed linear relationship with water supply in the soil. According to TBH, irrigation of sweet sorghum needs to be performed when the soil tension reaches 20 kPa. The TBH values did not differ significantly among the four cultivars at the 5% significance level according to Tukey test.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21536/18962,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Comparative analysis of five DNA isolation protocols and three drying methods for leaves samples of Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez,"The aim of the study was to establish a DNA isolation protocol Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez., able to obtain samples of high yield and quality for use in genomic analysis. A commercial kit and four classical methods of DNA extraction were tested, including three cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based and one sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-based methods. Three drying methods for leaves samples were also evaluated including drying at room temperature (RT), in an oven at 40ºC (S40), and in a microwave oven (FMO). The DNA solutions obtained from different types of leaves samples using the five protocols were assessed in terms of cost, execution time, and quality and yield of extracted DNA. The commercial kit did not extract DNA with sufficient quantity or quality for successful PCR reactions. Among the classic methods, only the protocols of Dellaporta and of Khanuja yielded DNA extractions for all three types of foliar samples that resulted in successful PCR reactions and subsequent enzyme restriction assays. Based on the evaluated variables, the most appropriate DNA extraction method for Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez. was that of Dellaporta, regardless of the method used to dry the samples. The selected method has a relatively low cost and total execution time. Moreover, the quality and quantity of DNA extracted using this method was sufficient for DNA sequence amplification using PCR reactions and to get restriction fragments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21305/18961,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The present study aimed to characterize morphometrically aggregates of a Inceptisol, originated from pelitic rocks, after 1.5 years of the implementation of a management system that adopts conservation tillage practices in the coffee cultivation. The aggregates were collected at the depths of 0.0-0.05; 0.05-0.20; 0.20-0.40; 0.40-0.80 m, both at row and interrow position in a coffee field, and also a natural environment of native vegetation that was used as a reference for the study. The analyzes of the aggregates were carried through 2D images obtained by scanning at 300 dpi spatial resolution. Each image contained 60 households and were processed using the software QUANTPORO. The morphometric variables were obtained: area, perimeter, compactness, roughness, appearance and Ferret diameter. For validation, the correlations among morphometric variables determined by image analysis and pattern aggregation indices (GMD, MWD and aggregates retained in the class > 2.00 mm) obtained by wet sieving were studied. After 1.5 years of implantation increased the dimensions of the aggregates on the natural environment have been detected, as well as better structural quality Inceptisol.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21294/19076,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of sugarcane waste in the control of interrill erosion,"The cultivation of sugarcane uses different cropping systems that result in varying quantities of crop waste, this may influence soil erosion. The objective of this study was to evaluate the loss of soil and water, the infiltration rate, and soil surface roughness in an area cultivated with sugarcane (Saccharum spp.). Six treatments with different levels of plant waste were evaluated: sugarcane without plant waste; sugarcane with 4.0 Mg ha-1 of waste; sugarcane with 8.0 Mg ha-1 of waste; sugarcane with 12.0 Mg ha-1 of waste; sugarcane with 16.0 Mg ha-1 of waste; and burned sugarcane. The treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with four replications, totalling 24 experimental plots. As soil depth increased, there is reduction in macroporosity, total soil porosity, organic carbon content, mean geometric diameter and weighted mean diameter of the soil aggregates, whereas the bulk density of the soil displays the opposite trend. The presence of sugarcane waste on the soil surface increases the time required for the initiation of surface runoff. Sugarcane waste does not alter soil surface roughness, and at the minimum amount of waste administered (4 Mg ha-1) reduces losses of soil and water and increases the infiltration rate. The lack of soil surface coverage after harvesting the sugarcane contributes to soil and water loss, and reduces the rate of stable infiltration of water into the soil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21236/18959,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Characterization, classification and analysis of the main properties of the Southwestern Goias soil","Characterization of the soil and the grouping of its properties through main component analysis can assist in the classification and observation of the consequences of the conversion of native forest areas in pastures. Such data can aid in management practices. Considering the lack of studies in Cerrado soils of south-western Goias, developed metagranites of Jurubatuba suite, the objective was to classify and study the physical, chemical and mineralogical soil (under native forest and pasture) Southwest of Goias. Soil sampling and classification followed the Field Methods Manual and the Brazilian System of Soil Classification, respectively. The physical, chemical and mineralogical soil were studied, as well as main component analysis made for these attributes. The profile 1 under native forest was classified as “Cambissolo Háplico Tb eutrófico latossólico”. The profile 2 under degraded pasture was rated “Latossolo Amarelo eutrófico típico”. In addition, the profile 3 under rotated pasture was rated as “Latossolo Vermelho eutrófico chernossólico”. It was observed that the “Latossolos” have higher bulk density and soil penetration resistance, indicating greater soil compaction. They showed high amounts of iron oxides and minor amount of nutrients such as calcium and magnesium. The principal component analysis allowed the grouping of profiles into two groups. Group 1 brought together the properties related to “Latossolos”, and the second was related to “Cambissolo” properties. Thus, the principal components analysis aids the understanding of soil properties and the grouping of soils with similar characteristics, the level of order and management.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21202/18957,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Growth and quality of australian cedar saplings originated from different multiclonal minigarden systems,"Forestry researchers often evaluate minicutting vegetative propagation of Australian cedar (Toona ciliata) as a viable technique for this species. However, the adoption of minigarden systems for commercial propagation still requires viability and quality testing of saplings produced after multiple harvests. In the present work, we evaluate survival, growth, and quality of Australian cedar saplings grown from minicuttings originating from multiple harvests of ministumps planted in gutter or tube systems. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with a 2 × 4 factorial treatment structure (two minigarden systems and four minicutting harvests). For the gutter system, six minicutting harvests were performed 50, 86, 115, 149, 177 and 212 days after planting ministumps, whereas for the tube system, four harvests were performed 115, 149, 177 and 212 days after planting ministumps. At the end of each sapling production cycle (105 days after each minicutting harvest), saplings were evaluated for survival, foliar area, dry mass of aerial parts, number and length of adventitious roots, dry mass of the root system, height to diameter ratio, ratio between the dry mass of aerial parts and dry mass of root system, and Dickson’s Quality Index. Sapling survival was not affected by minigarden system, except for a reduction observed in fourth cycle saplings from the tube system. Sapling quality was also similar between systems. However, sapling growth potential decreased with production cycle, indicating that ministumps lose vigor with multiple harvests.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19916/18956,E-ISSN 1679-0359

There were collected and analysed 36 samples of sun dried meat, acquired in 12 different establishment (supermarkets, mini-markets, butchers and a municipal market), and quantified mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, E. coli and presence of Salmonella spp., as well as specific content humidity, water activity (Aw) and chloride. In 83% of the establishments, mesophilic bacteria counted > 105 CFU.g-1 and 58% coliforms at 35º C > 105 NMP.g- 1 and coliforms at 45ºC > 103 NMP.g-1. Escherichia coli was isolated in 75% of the establishments. Staphylococcus spp. ranged from 4.8 x 104 to 9.0 x 108 UFC.g-1, not being isolated Staphylococcus coagulase positive. Salmonella was found in 25% of the establishments. The humidity in the sun dried meat samples ranged from 52.37% to 74.69%, the Aw from 0.87 to 0.95 and the chloride from 3.16% to 5.98%. Salmonella was 100% resistant to tetracycline, acid nalidixic, cephalothin and erythromycin, with intermediate resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin. Escherichia coli was resistant to erythromycin (100%), ampicillin (68.7%), cephalothin (71.4%), tetracycline (64.2%), nalidixic acid (35.7%) and gentamicin (12.5%). Multiresistant strains of E. coli were observed in 87.5% of the isolates, and it happened that in 28.6% of the resistance it was mediated by plasmids. Multidrug resistance profile was observed in all Salmonella, with a strain showing plasmid resistance. The marketing of sun dried meat in Cruz das Almas presents hygienic and sanitary failures due to it’s high microbial loads. This fact undermines the safety and product lifetime, and may also pose risk to public health since it markets strains with antimicrobial.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/14389/14601,E-ISSN 1679-0359

36,2015,"Qualidade do leite bovino no Semiárido do Rio Grande do Norte, Brasil","Objetivou-se com o presente trabalho, avaliar a composição e qualidade do leite cru refrigerado, proveniente de tanques, de acordo com o enquadramento dos produtores, o tipo de alimentação e os níveis de produção das propriedades que fornecem leite para a Associação dos Pequenos Agropecuaristas do Sertão de Angicos - APASA. Os dados coletados foram provenientes de 47 produtores, provenientes de diferentes cidades do estado do Rio Grande do Norte, vinculados a APASA. As coletas foram realizadas em 23 tanques ao longo do mês de junho de 2013, sendo duas coletas por semana, e cinco amostras por tanque, totalizando 920 observações. As propriedades foram caracterizadas de acordo com o tipo de tanque, particular ou comunitário; alimento fornecido durante as coletas, volumoso e volumoso + concentrado; o enquadramento do produtor, produtor familiar e não familiar; e por fim de acordo com a quantidade ou estrato de produção das propriedades. Foram realizadas as análises para os teores de gordura, proteína total, caseína, lactose, sólidos totais, extrato seco desengordurado (ESD), crioscopia, ureia, contagem de células somáticas (CCS) e resíduo de antibiótico. As análises estatísticas foram realizadas para cada grupo e as médias foram comparadas pelo Teste de Tukey, utilizando o nível de significância crítico de 5% de probabilidade através do procedimento PROC GLM do programa SAS®. A maioria dos componentes diferiu estatisticamente para cada classe analisada. A ureia e a CCS foram os componentes que mantiveram as maiores diferenças e variações, provavelmente devido a grande variedade no perfil dos produtores, e também, no caso da CCS, na qual os valores observados sofreram grande variação de amplitude. A maioria dos componentes do leite apresentaram diferença estatística entre tipo de estrato, tipo de produtor, tipo de alimentação e tipo de tanque, mas a sua magnitude pode ser considerada de baixa importância e, provavelmente, pouco influencie na fisiologia e produtividade do animal. Portanto, concluiu-se que, apesar das pequenas variações encontradas nos componentes do leite fornecido a APASA, eles são influenciados pelos diferentes tipos de manejo alimentar, volume de leite produzido, bem como pelo tipo de produtor",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18139/16745,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Hypertrophic osteopathy associated with systemic granulomatous disease in a horse,"A 4-year-old Criollo stallion was presented at the equine clinic of veterinary hospital of the Federal University of Santa Maria, RS, with a 30-day history of progressive weight loss, anemia and swelling of the forelimbs and face. Physical examination revealed that the swelling was firm and had a bone-like consistency, also radiographs showed extensive periosteal proliferation on the forelimb long bones that suggested hypertrophic osteopathy (Marie´s disease). Physical examinations identified no respiratory findings. However, during ultrasound examination, superficial lung disease was identified. The animal was treated with antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 12 days. Due to a complete lack of response to this treatment, the horse was euthanized. At necropsy several granulomatous lesions were identified in the thorax, abdomen and testicular tunics. Bony proliferation was evident on many bones of the appendicular skeleton and face. Based on these findings the diagnosis of hypertrophic osteopathy associated with sarcoidosis was established. It is important to perform a thorough clinical examination and include hypertrophic osteopathy in the differential diagnosis of diseases that are accompanied by swelling of the face and limbs as edema from various causes, fibrous osteodystrophy, for example.

37,2016,Surgical management of ectrodactyly in a dog,"Ectrodactyly is the term used to designate cases in which soft and bone tissue separation within the distal region of the thoracic limbs is present. It is observed in particular below the metacarpal bones and extending to the radius and ulna. In addition, it can often be associated with ipsilateral elbow luxation. We describe a case of ectrodactyly in a 3-month-old mongrel dog, where bone and soft tissue separation occurred between the third and fourth digits, extending proximally to the carpal region. We identified shortening of the ulna without elbow luxation. The dog was subjected to a surgical procedure comprising bone and soft tissue reconstruction and ulnar diaphyseal osteotomy, which was fixed using a Steinmann pin in the intramedullary canal, maintaining a distance of 1 cm between the two ulnar fragments. Two distal phalanges were removed because it was not possible to reposition them anatomically in the limb. The dog walked with mild lameness nine months after surgery.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20067/18633,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Tuberculosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the Baixo Araguari Region, Amapá, Brazil","Water buffalo are of great economic importance in Brazilian Amazonia, which has the largest herd in Brazil. Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a zoonotic disease that results in severe losses to water buffalo production. Although the disease has already been described in the country, data on the occurrence and distribution of bovine tuberculosis in water buffalo in Brazil is very scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of bovine tuberculosis in water buffalo in the Baixo Araguari River region of Amapá, Brazil. Thirty herds, randomly selected from the 41 herds of water buffalo in the region, were sampled. From those herds, 212 randomly selected water buffalo were subjected to the comparative tuberculin skin test. The proportion of Baixo Araguari River region herds that were positive for bovine tuberculosis was 50.0% (95% CI 31.3% to 68.7%) and the proportion of animals that were positive was estimated to be 14.8% (95% CI 7.8% to 21.9%). Our results show that bovine tuberculosis is spread widely among water buffalo in the Baixo Araguari River region, which suggests that measures to control the disease should be undertaken in the region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20458/18775,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Systolic blood pressure and heart rate in cats with chronic kidney disease undergoing chemical restraint during hemodialysis,"Dialysis is one of the used methods for treatment of Acute Renal Injury (ARI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to replace the function of the kidneys when refers to blood depuration. Hemodialysis removes toxins accumulated in the body directly from the blood, being a useful alternative therapy for dogs and cats with CKD in advanced stages. Because of the difficulty on handling the patient feline, this procedure requires sedation. However, few studies have been conducted to assess the safety of anesthesia in dogs and cats with CKD undergoing dialysis. The present study aimed to evaluate two different protocols of chemical restraint in cats with CKD and the effect of these on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR), since the procedure of extracorporeal circulation leads the patient to a hypotensive frame. Twelve adult cats were used, with an average weight of 4 kg, CKD, underwent two anesthetic protocols: Group GP (n = 6) using propofol, and group GCM (n = 6) using ketamine-midazolam association for the implantation procedure of central venous catheter (CVC) and hemodialysis. Cats in GP as well as the GCM group showed statistical difference in the change in SBP and HR only from baseline compared to the other time points evaluated. The two protocols maintained SBP and HR within physiological values.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20240/18629,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Ingestive behavior of crossbred Santa Inês sheep fed water with different salinity levels,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of four water salinity levels on the ingestive behavior of non-castrated crossbred Santa Inês sheep. Thirty-two non-castrated crossbred Santa Inês sheep in feedlot, at seven months of age and initial average weight of 21.76±1.25 kg, were used in the experiment. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four treatments and eight replicates. Four concentrations of salts in the water fed to the animals were evaluated: low (640 mg/l); medium (3,188 mg/l); high (5,740 mg/l) and very high (8,326 mg/l) levels of total dissolved solids (TDS). For the ingestive behaviors, the animals were observed every ten minutes, for 24 hours, to determine the time spent feeding, ruminating and idle. Also, cud chewing and the average number of defecations and urinations and the frequency of water ingestion were determined. The time spent feeding, ruminating and idle were not changed by the salinity levels in the water. Dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber intake, total chewing time, total cud chews per day, number of daily meals, average duration of each meal and number of defecations per day did not change either. However, feeding and rumination efficiency in grams of DM/h, water intake and number of urinations were linearly affected, whereas the variables rumination efficiency in grams of NDF/h, grams of dry matter per cud, grams of neutral detergent fiber per cud, number of cuds, number of chews per cud and chewing time per cud presented quadratic effect. The different levels of total dissolved solids (640; 3,188; 5,740; and 8.326 mg/l) in the water fed to the sheep did not cause alterations in their ingestive behavior. In conclusion, water with up to 8,326 mg TDS/l can be an alternative strategic and seasonal method to water crossbred Santa Ines sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21498/18725,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Feed intake, nutrient digestibility, milk production and composition in dairy cows fed silage of wet brewers grain","The aim of this study was to evaluate the supply of wet brewers grain silage with and without nutrient additives in ensiling (wheat bran, soybeans hulls and ground corn), and the effect of additives on the intake and digestibility of dry matter and nutrients as well as the efficiency, production and milk composition of Holstein cows. Four multiparous Holstein cows were used, with an average milk production of 25 liters per day. The cows were randomly assigned, via the Latin Square design (4x4), to one of four experimental diets. The experimental period was 21 days. The results obtained in the experiment were evaluated by analysis of variance, Fisher’s F test and Tukey’s test at 5 % probability. The experimental diets consisted of wet brewers grain silage alone, and this silage with the addition of wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn. The diets did not affect the initial body weight of the animals. Diets containing wheat bran and ground corn provided a higher intake of dry matter (21.78 and 21.50 kg day-1) and organic matter (20.42 and 20.22 kg day-1) compared to the wet brewers grain silage alone and the diet containing soybean hulls. The results observed for dry matter (636.96 and 632.96 g kg-1), organic matter (659.16 and 654.35 g kg-1 DM), crude protein (712.84 and 717.79 g kg-1 DM) and neutral detergent fiber (598.99 and 538.90 g kg-1 DM) when cows were fed diets containing soybean hulls and ground corn, respectively, were higher than other diets. The different diets did not change daily milk production, milk production corrected for 3.5 % fat or milk composition. The milk urea nitrogen from cows fed ground corn diets was a lower concentration (17.67 mg dL-1), however, it was still above the suitable range (10 to 14 mg dL-1). Providing wet brewers grain silage with soybeans hulls or ground corn to Holstein cows increased the digestibility of dry matter and nutrients. However, the use of silages with wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn did not alter the efficiency, production or milk composition of cows fed with these silages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21646/18726,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,"Models predict the proportion of bone, muscle, and fat in ewe lamb carcasses from in vivo measurements of the 9th to 11th rib section and of the 12th rib","The present work aimed at evaluating models that predict the proportion of bone, muscle, and fat in ewe lamb carcasses using in vivo data obtained from the 9th to 11th rib section and from the 12th rib. A study population of 30 wooled ewe lambs, derived from Texel breed crosses, were fed with different concentrate levels (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) and slaughtered at a weight of 37.70 ± 10.23 kg. Carcass fat content (FC%) and muscle content (MC%) were estimated from models using the proportion of muscle and fat in the 9th to 11th rib section or in the 12th rib, with or without additional data regarding subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT mm) or carcass ribeye area (RA cm2). Carcass bone content (BC%) was predicted based on the proportion of bones in the 9th to 11th rib section or in the 12th rib. Modeling with in vivo data included fasting body weight (FBW), withers height (WH), and ultrasound measurements of SFT and RA. The FC% could be estimated from the carcass SFT and fat content in the 12th rib. The MC% was more accurately predicted from the proportion of muscles in the 9th to 11th rib section and from carcass RA. The 9th to 11th rib section provided the most accurate data for the prediction of BC%. To determine FC% and MC% from in vivo inputs, the model must include FBW and WH. In vivo FBW measurements alone allow for the estimation of BC%. We recommend the use of 12th rib composition for the accurate estimation of carcass fat content, and the use of the 9th and 11th rib section for the prediction of carcass muscle and bone content. Models using in vivo data for the prediction of fat, muscle, and bone in ewe lambs should incorporate FBW and WH.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21663/18727,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Energy and protein requirements of crossbred cattle in feedlot,"The objective of this study is to predict the energy and protein requirements of crossbred dairy cattle in feedlot. The study was conducted at the Unidade Acadêmica de Serra Talhada, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Brazil with 30 bulls with a body weight of 339.1 ± 35.4 kg. Five animals were slaughtered at the end of the adaptation period to serve as the reference group; the remainder of the animals was slaughtered after 112 days. The latter group was randomly allocated to receive five treatments: 0, 17, 34, 51 and 68% of concentrate in the feed using a completely randomized design. The dietary intake of the animals that were not given concentrate was restricted to 1.5% of their body weight; these animals composed the group fed for maintenance. The body composition and empty body weight (EBW) were estimated by means of the comparative slaughter method and full dissection of a half-carcass. The results showed that for crossbred dairy bulls in confinement, the net and metabolizable energy requirements were 86.49 and 138 kcal EBW-0.75 day-1, respectively, and the efficiency of use of metabolizable energy for maintenance and gain were 62.67% and 31.67%, respectively. The net energy (NEg) and net protein (NPg) requirements for gain can be estimated using the following equations, respectively: NEg= 0.0392*EBW0.75*EBWG1.0529 and NPg= 242.34 x EBWG - 23.09 x RE. The efficiency of use of metabolizable protein for gain was 25.8%, and the protein requirement for maintenance was 2.96 g EBW-0.75 day-1. The rumen degradable protein can supply 62.44% of the crude protein requirements of feedlot dairy crossbred bulls with a body weight of 450 kg while gaining 1 kg day-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21476/18723,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Organs and carcass non-integrant components of Holstein calves, slaughtered at different weights, held in different finishing systems","The objective of this study was to evaluate the weight of the empty body and non-integrant components of Holstein calves carcass, kept in confinement system or pasture, slaughtered at different weights. We used 43 Holstein calves, entire, age and initial body weight of approximately 58 days and 57 kg, distributed entirely at random in confinement or cultivated pasture. In feeding systems, it was pre-stipulated four slaughter weights (SW - 140, 180, 220 and 260 kg of live weight). In confinement, were provided corn silage and concentrate based on corn meal and soybean meal, in the ratio 40:60. The other animals in ryegrass pasture, followed by pearl millet, were fed based in supplementation of corn bran and soybean meal to 1% of live weight. The EBW showed linear growth with increasing slaughter weight (SW), as well as income from hot and cold carcass and there was no effect in relation EBW/ SW. The leather, the scraps, the head, the legs, as well as the sum of external components showed growth in its absolute weight as the weight increased at the slaughter of animals. In relative terms, the hot and cold carcass yields were inversely correlated with the relative weights, as well as external components (- 0.68 and - 0.81), the heart (- 0.35 and -0, 38) lungs (- 0.53 and - 0.53), the sum of the gastrointestinal tract (-0.75 and - 0.77), the sum of vital organs (- 0.71 to - 0.75) respectively in feedlot and pasture. This is due to the different ages that the animals were slaughtered (200; 237; 251 and 263 days of age), due to pre-stipulate weights. The absolute weights of heart, kidney, lungs, liver, spleen, gall bladder, reproductive tract and gastrointestinal tract accompanied the increase in weight at animal’s slaughter. However, when grouped, showed no difference related to the increase in weight at slaughter. The differences presented by the liver, trachea and spleen were sufficient to alter the absolute and relative weights of the set of internal components, where the animals finished on pasture had higher weight. The animals finished on pasture had higher absolute weights (0.48 against 1.18 kg) and relatives (0.31 and 0.79%).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21493/18778,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Carcass physical composition and physic-chemical characteristics of meat from Nellore cattle,"Assessment of carcass physical composition and physicochemical characteristics of meat from Nellore males distributed randomly into three treatments: males castrated at 13 months of age at puberty (n=26); castrated at 18 months of age, 15 days before confinement (n=26); and young bulls (n=25). For the evaluation of meat chemical characteristics, we used samples of 12 animals taken at random from each treatment. The experimental design was completely randomized. Animals were slaughtered at 22 months of age after 100 days of confinement. The carcasses of young bulls showed higher contents of muscle (66.46 %) and bone (16.03 %), and lower fat content (17.66 %), in relation to that of steers castrated at 13 (62.83,15.28, and 22.11 %, respectively) or 18 months (63.99, 15.29, and 21.53%, respectively), which did not differ amongst themselves. The meat of young bulls was darker (3.07 points) than the meat from those castrated at 13 months of age (3.43 points), while the meat from those castrated at 18 months displayed an intermediate color (3.29 points), not differing from the others. Young bulls yielded meat with lower content of intramuscular fat (3.18 points) and lipids (3.81%) in relation to those castrated at 13 (4.58 points and 6.77%, respectively) or 18 months (4.52 points and 5.66%, respectively). Protein content was higher (P 0.05) by the age of castration, with young bulls having lower values in relation to the castrated males. Castration of Nellore young bulls in early puberty increases the edible portion of the carcass due to the higher body fat deposit.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21439/18647,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Partial replacement of corn by forage cactus in the diets of lactating goats,"The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the partial replacement of corn by forage cactus (Nopalea cochenillifera Salm Dyck) in the diets of lactating goats on the nutrient intake, milk production and composition and ingestive behavior. Five crossbreed Saanen x Pardo Alpina goats with body weights of 47 ± 3.3 kg were used in the study. The design was 5x5 Latin square design, in which the treatments were as follows: 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40% of girl cactus included in the diet as a partial replacement of corn, with 0, 18, 36, 54 and 72% of the added the cactus comprising of gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Walp) as roughage in all treatments. Treatment did not affect (P > 0.05) the dry matter intake, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and total digestible nutrients with the increasing levels of cactus in the diet, presenting means of 1.64, 0.26, 0.82, 0.54 and 1.17 kg day-1, respectively. In the same way, no influence was observed on the daily milk production and levels of fat, protein, lactose and total solids of milk, which averaged 1.18 kg day-1; 3.74, 3.34, 5.06 and 13.56%, respectively. The inclusion of cactus also had no influence (P > 0.05) on the ingestion behavior. The treatment with 35% cactus showed a lower impairment of food intake (31%). The partial replacement of the corn by the girl cactus in the diets of dairy goats can be accomplished because it does not alter the intake, milk yield and composition and feeding behavior. The replacement of up to 54% corn by the cactus is recommended to reduce producer costs for food.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21139/18641,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Chemical composition of elephant grass silages supplemented with different levels of dehydrated cashew bagasse,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical composition of elephant grass silages supplemented with different levels dried cashew bagasse (DCB). Our experiment used a randomized design replicated four times, each replicate consisting of the following five treatments: 100% elephant grass; 95% elephant grass + 5% DCB; 90% elephant grass + 10% DCB; 85% elephant grass + 15% DCB; and 80% elephant grass + 20% DCB. The elephant grass was cut manually to a residual height of 5 cm at 80 days of age, and cashew bagasse was obtained from the processing of cashew stalks used in fruit pulp manufacturing in Mossoró/RN. Plastic buckets were used as experimental silos, and 90 days after ensiling the experimental silos were opened and the contents analyzed. The addition of dried cashew bagasse to silage linearly increased the levels of dried matter and crude protein by 0.59% and 0.13%, respectively, for each 1% addition (P < 0.05). The neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent content of the silages was reduced by 0.22% and 0.09%, respectively, for each 1% addition of the bagasse. The total carbohydrate content was not influenced by the bagasse addition (P > 0.05), and averaged 82.29%. The levels of non-fiber carbohydrate showed linear growth (P < 0.05) as the dehydrated cashew bagasse was added, and pH and ammoniacal nitrogen levels were reduced. The addition of the dehydrated bagasse to elephant grass silage improves its chemical composition, and it can be effectively added up to the level of 20%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21386/18733,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A completely randomized 3x2 design (restriction level x sex class) was used to evaluate thirty lambs approximately two months of age with an average initial body weight of 13 ± 1.49 kg. When the average body weight of the animals in one of the treatment groups reached 28 kg, all animals were slaughtered. Sex class had effect on body weight at slaughter, empty body weight, hot carcass weight and cold carcass weight. The weight of the leg was greater in non-castrated animals. There was linear decreased effect according to increasing levels of restriction for the carcass cuts, except for leg and rear loin yield. There was statistic difference between sex class for the weights of kidneys, paw, and large intestine of non-castrated animals (P < 0.05). There was a negative linear association between level of food restriction and mass of blood, head, leather, paw, rumen, reticulum, abomasum, small intestine, large intestine; perirenal, omental, mesenteric and heart fat.

37,2016,Tropical kudzu as a protein source in sheep diets,"Protein nutrition plays a key role in ruminant performance and represents the largest proportion of costs in animal feed. The present study evaluated whether the roughage portion of Santa Inês sheep diets could be supplemented with different ratios of tropical kudzu as a protein source and assessed the best inclusion level of tropical kudzu based on digestibility, intake, nitrogen balance and feeding behavior. Twenty rams were evaluated during the 20-day experimental period, and they were fed formulated diets with a roughage portion (60%) consisting of Elephant grass and tropical kudzu, the latter supplemented at different concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 75% on a dry matter basis). Forty percent of the concentrate portion consisted primarily of ground corn and soybean meal adjusted to obtain an isoproteic diet. Chemical and bromatological analyses, as well as, analyses to assess intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and feeding behavior, were conducted. No statistically significant differences were found (P>0.05) for the intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose (HEMI), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) or for the feeding behavior (feeding, rumination and idle times in h/day) and nitrogen balance between the diets studied. Thus, tropical kudzu can be considered a feed alternative to supplementation with prime protein foods (in this case, soybean meal) in sheep diets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19154/18638,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Energetic values and performace of broilers feeding sorghum and soybean meal based diets supplemented with B-glucanase and B-xylanase,"Grains, brans, and vegetable meals may contain non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), which increases viscosity in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and interfere with the digestion and absorption of nutrients. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and determine the metabolizable energy of a sorghum-based broiler diet with and without the supplementation of an enzymatic complex. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with 1200 chickens, using sorghum-based feed with and without the addition of 50 g of enzyme-CCE complex (?-glucanase and ?-xylanase), and with two levels of metabolizable energy (ME kg-1): ME; ME + CCE; reduced ME (-50 kcal kg-1); and reduced ME + CCE. The data were subjected to an analysis of variance and the means were compared using a Tukey’s test at the 5% significance level. At 42 and 47 days of age, the living weight of the birds fed with the reduced ME was low, while birds fed with reduced ME + CCE had the same weight as those fed with other energy diets (ME and ME + CCE). Feed conversion was poorest at 47 days of age for the birds on reduced ME diet. In the metabolic test (with fattening diets) to determine AME and AMEn, the reduced ME diet had the lowest result, confirming the effect of the addition of enzymes. The addition of CCE to sorghum-based diets provides enough enzymatic activity to increase the metabolizable energy of the diet (50 kcal of AME) and influence the growth performance of broilers at the slaughtering age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21098/18777,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Meat quality of Morada Nova lambs subjected to different feeding regimes,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pre- and post-calving feed restriction on quantitative characteristics and lipid profile of meat from Morada Nova sheep. Twenty-four male lambs from single births only, with an initial weight of 10.0 ± 3.07 kg and at four months of age, were distributed in a randomized complete design, into three groups: pre-calving restriction (R-PRE; n=8) post-calving restriction (R-POS; n=8), and ad libitum feeding (ADLI; n=8). To make up the experimental treatments, the feeding regime applied previously on the sheep in the last third of pregnancy was considered. Treatments ADLI and R-POS were composed of lambs born from ewes fed ad libitum in the last third of pregnancy. Treatment R-PRE consisted of lambs born from ewes subjected to feed restriction in the last third of pregnancy at 60% of the recommended requirements for the group of ewes feeding ad libitum. For the lambs from treatments ADLI and R-PRE, the diet was supplied allowing 20% of the total supplied as refusals. For the animals from R-POS, a 30% restriction was imposed in relation to the animals feeding ad libitum. Animals were slaughtered with an average live weight of 25 kg. Afterwards, carcasses were chilled at 4 ºC for 24 h. Meat quality measurements were taken on the right side of each carcass; pH was determined immediately after slaughter and then again after chilling. Samples of the longissimus dorsi muscle were collected and frozen at -20 ºC. Moisture, ash, protein, total lipids, water-holding capacity, and cooking loss were determined in the meat samples, which were then subjected to the shear-force test. The sensory analysis was determined by the hedonic-scale test, in which sensory parameters of tenderness, juiciness, flavor, aroma, and overall acceptability and fatty acid profile were evaluated. There was a feed-restriction effect on protein, lipids, and water-holding capacity (P0.05). Saturated fatty acid contents were affected by the treatments (P0.05). Feed restriction does not compromise the physicochemical or sensory quality of Morada Nova lambs meat, but rather provides a meat product of good acceptance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18415/18636,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Influence of storage on the chemical composition of Stylosanthes hays for equine feeding,"During dry seasons, equines are traditionally fed hay. However, if not prepared under favorable climatic conditions and if not properly stored, hay does not preserve its nutritional value. The aim of this research was to evaluate the chemical composition in Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão and Estilosantes Campo Grande hay varieties, used to feed equines over 225 days of storage. Treatments consisted of Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão and Estilosantes Campo Grande hay varieties, assessed at six moments of storage: 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, and 225 days. The experiment followed a completely randomized split-plot design. In the comparison between varieties, differences (P0.05) over the 225 days of storage. The storage period had little impact on the nutritional quality of the assessed hays. The Stylosanthes guianensis cv.

The objective of this study was to characterize calculi and urine of domestic rabbits treated with mesenchymal adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) after partial urinary bladder allotransplantation. Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were submitted to surgery and treated postoperatively with cyclosporine or ADSCs for immunosuppression. There were no signs of graft rejection in either treatment group 30 days after surgery. Fewer animals presented bladder calculi in the ADSC treated group (33.3%) compared to the cyclosporine treated group (58.3%). Calcium was the predominant component of calculi in both groups. Urinalysis revealed no haematuria or bacteriuria in the ADSC group, in contrast to the results obtained for the cyclosporine group. ADSCs may be an attractive alternative to cyclosporine for immunosuppression after bladder allotransplantation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21193/18628,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Effects of different hay: concentrate ratios on body and testicular-epididymal biometry and metabolic profile of Santa Ines lambs,"This study was carried out to verify the effects of different hay: concentrate ratios on body, testicular and epididymal development and metabolic profile of hair sheep lambs. Twenty-nine Santa Ines lambs were used. Treatments consisted of diets with different hay: concentrate ratios (100:0-Control, 80:20- T1, 60:40-T2, 40:60-T3 and 20:80-T4). The characteristics evaluated were: body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), hearth girth (HG), body length (BL), height at withers (HW), height at rump (HR), rump width (RW), chest width (CW), scrotal perimeter (SP), testis length (TL) testis width (TW), testis thickness (TT), cauda epididymal length (CEL), cauda epididymal width (CAW), cauda epididymal thickness (CET), scrotal skin thickness (SST) and testicular volume (TV). Blood samples were collected to analyze glucose, urea, albumin, total cholesterol, total proteins, inorganic phosphate and magnesium concentrations. The body and testicular-epididymal measurements increased linearly with increases in the energy concentration in the diet. BW, BL, CW, RW, HG and BCS showed positive high correlations (r = 0.71 to 0.94) with all testis-epididymal measurements. The results of the metabolic profile study showed interactions between the addition of the concentrated feed and time of blood collection on total proteins, albumin, urea, cholesterol, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations. At the beginning of the trial, hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia were verified in T3 and T4. However, the indices returned to normal over time with the continuity in the diet supplied. Hypomagnesaemia was verified in all treatments. The plasmatic phosphorus concentration was sufficiently high at the end of all treatments, except control. In conclusion, the BL, HG, CW, RW as well as the BCS may be used to estimate the development of the testes and epididymis. The metabolic profile results verified that adjusts are necessary in the amount of concentrated feed given to the lambs when Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp) is provided to the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21178/18774,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Serological study of the Leptospira spp. infection in sheep and goats slaughtered in the State of Paraíba, semiarid of Northeastern Brazil","The aim of this survey was to determine the frequency of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in goats and sheep slaughtered in different slaughterhouses in the State of Paraiba, in the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 500 goats and 500 sheep randomly selected. To verify the presence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), using 24 serovars as antigens, was used. From the 1,000 animals analyzed, 82 (8.2%; 95% CI = 7.0%-10.5%) were sero-reactive being 26/500 (5.2%; 95% CI = 3.5%-7.5%) in goats and 56/500 (11.2%; 95% CI = 8.7%-14.2%) in sheep. The most frequent serovars were Hardjobovis (14.6%) and Autumnalis (13.4%). In goats, the most frequent serovar was the Hardjobovis, and in sheep the Ballum, with frequencies of 19.2% and 17.9%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the frequency of positive animals among slaughterhouses, both for goats (p = 0.035) and for sheep (p = 0.004), with the county of Alhandra presenting the highest frequency of seropositive animals for both species. It is concluded that sheep and goats from the semiarid region of the Northeastern Brazil may have become adapted to the serovars Hardjobovis e Autumnalis, as well as wild rodents may be involved in the transmission of the disease. It is possible that the climatic conditions influenced in the transmissibility of the leptospirosis, especially in the Mata Paraibana mesoregion, however it was not considered as being sufficient to justify the low frequency of seropositive animals. In this way, it is possible to suggest the hypothesis that the rusticity of the small ruminants in the studied region contributed to the low sero-reactivity verified.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20974/18600,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Blood parameters of sheep with high infection of Haemonchus contortus and treated with “mushroom of the sun” (Agaricus blazei),"Blood and parasitological parameters of sheep experimentally infected with Haemonchus contortus and treated with “mushroom of the sun” (Agaricus blazei) were assessed. Lambs infected with the nematode were divided into three groups: treated with basidiocarp powder from the fungus, wormed with trichlorfon, and a control group that did not receive anthelmintic. Split-plot design analysis was performed where the treatments were defined as plots and four periods of collection were defined as subplots. Interaction between the treatments and the collection periods for the fecal egg counts per gram of feces (FEC) was observed. Treatment with “mushroom of the sun” showed anthelmintic efficacies ranging from 28.6 to 54.2%. Similar performances to weight gain were observed among the groups. A significant interaction between treatments and evaluation periods was observed for erythrocyte counts, hematocrit value, and serum concentrations of albumin and urea. The values of the mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte distribution width, and leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts, as well as the mean platelet volume, varied among the collection days. The administration of “mushroom of the sun” significantly reduced the FEC, did not influence on the erythrocyte count and hematocrit value, which remained within normal limits. However it increased the serum concentrations of albumin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20955/18599,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases and resistance in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family isolated from healthy sheep and dogs in Umuarama, Paraná, Brazil","Bacterial resistance is a primary public health concern worldwide. Within this context, pets and breeding animals act as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria (MR), such as those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and those presenting plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR). The aim of this study was to detect the presence of ESBL and PMQR in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, isolated from healthy sheep and dogs from non-intense farming rural properties in the Umuarama region of Paraná, Brazil. A total of 81 oral and rectal swabs from dogs and sheep from 11 small rural properties were analyzed. These swabs were inoculated in tubes containing brain heart infusion broth (BHI), and the resulting cultures were inoculated on MacConkey agar (MAC) supplemented with 10 ?g/mL cefotaxime for the selection of ESBL producers. The cells were also plated on MAC supplemented with 50 ?g/mL nalidixic acid for selecting quinolone-resistant enterobacteria. The bacterial isolates were subjected to biochemical identification tests, antibiograms, double-disk synergic tests, and polymerase chain reaction analysis for resistance-inducing genes (blaESBL, qnr, and genes encoding efflux pump and acetylases). Four (5.00%) bacterial isolates (3 Escherichia coli and 1 Morganella morganii) resistant to cephalosporins and/or quinolones were identified; of these, three (75%) isolates were from sheep and one (25%) from a dog. These findings indicate the presence of MR bacteria in the normal microbiota of the animals studied. Animals colonized with such bacteria can contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance to other animals, environment, and/or human beings and can harbor endogenous infections in unfavorable conditions, which have poor prognosis due to the limited therapeutic options.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21091/18601,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Ex vivo and in vivo study of Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer in the measurement of intraocular pressure in dogs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer in measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in dogs. Twenty eyes were used in an ex vivo study in which the calibration curve for manometry vs. tonometry was determined by artificially raising the IOP in 5 mmHg increments up to 60 mmHg (10-60 mmHg). Both eyes of 10 anesthetized dogs were studied in vivo to compare manometry vs. tonometry. In the ambulatory study, 168 healthy eyes, 74 eyes with glaucoma and 60 eyes with uveitis were evaluated by tonometry, which was performed with topical anesthesia and 1% fluorescein eye drops for the formation of fluorescein semicircles. The ex vivo study showed an excellent correlation coefficient (r2= 0.993) between the aneroid manometer and the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the in vivo study, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) between the IOP values by manometry and tonometry, showing the excellent accuracy of the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the ambulatory study using the Kowa HA-2 tonometer, the IOP values (mean±SD, in mmHg) were 15.1±1.8 (12.0 – 20.0) for the healthy eyes, 25.2±4.0 (20.0 – 38.0) for glaucomatous eyes and 10.1±2.3 (5.0 – 13.7) for eyes with uveitis. There was a strong correlation between the IOP values obtained by direct ocular manometry and those from the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the ambulatory study, the IOP values measured by the tonometer were compatible for healthy eyes and for eyes with glaucoma or uveitis. We conclude that Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer is accurate and practical for IOP measurement in dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20434/18598,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study evaluated the physical and laboratory characteristics of colostrum from dairy goats in the postpartum period, and the physical characteristics of the mammary glands in the same period. Of the 71 mammary glands evaluated, 12 were positive for bacterial isolates and the most frequent pathogenic agents were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 11). Median somatic cell counts (SCC) in animals positive for bacterial isolates were greater than in animals without bacterial isolates at parturition (696.0 vs. 256.0 x 103 mL –1) and 48 h postpartum (1,350 vs. 437.0 x 103 mL-1). In addition, 34 samples were positive for the California Mastitis Test (CMT; score >1+), indicating a positive relationship between this test and bacterial isolation. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most prevalent pathogenic agents, resulting in increase in SCC. Postpartum changes in mammary secretions were not good predictors of bacterial mastitis. Physical examination of mammary glands did not reveal significant changes for the diagnosis of mastitis in the postpartum period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20229/18597,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Arterial vascularization of the brain of the agouti (Dasyprocta aguti Linnaeus, 1766)","The agouti, a rodent that is geographically distributed throughout South America, is greatly valued for its meat. This paper describes the arterial vascularization of the base of the agouti’s brain, characterizing behavior, and arterial origin and distribution. Ten animals from the Center for the Multiplication of Wild Animals (CEMAS/UFERSA) were used and the study was approved by SISBIO (report number 32413- 1) and the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA/UFERSA) (protocol 02/2010). After euthanasia, the animals were incised in the thoracic cavity by an injection of red-stained Neoprene latex 650 and the skulls were subsequently opened. The brains were extracted from the skulls for ventral surface analysis and then fixed in an aqueous 10% formaldehyde solution. The agouti’s arterial vascularization of the brain has two main components, namely the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. The agouti’s carotid system accounts for vascularization of almost the entire forebrain, while the vertebrobasilar system accounts for vascularization of almost the entire posterior brain (medulla oblongata, pyramid, trapezoid body, cerebellum, bridge, and part of the third caudal section of the forebrain) through the caudal cerebral arteries originating from the terminal branches of the basilar artery. The main arteries on the brain surface include the basilar artery, which is unique, and the arterial pairs, specifically the vertebral arteries, cerebellar caudal arteries, trigeminal artery, rostral cerebellar artery, basilar terminal branch artery, cerebral caudal artery, communicating caudal branch of the cerebral carotid artery, cerebral carotid artery, communicating branch rostral cerebral carotid artery, choroidal rostral artery, medial branch of the communicating branch rostral artery, internal ophthalmic artery, middle cerebral artery, and rostral cerebral artery.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20200/18596,E-ISSN 1679-0359

We have evaluated the serum biochemical profile of healthy and Ehrlich tumor-bearing mice treated with different extracts of A. blazei. Total, supernatant, and polysaccharide extracts of A. blazei were obtained from suspensions (at acidic or neutral pH) kept in a water bath at 60 °C or in an ultrasonic bath at 37 °C. After oral administering the extracts to mice for 21 days, blood samples were collected for determination of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), urea, total protein, albumin, globulins, and alpha-, beta- and gamma-globulin fractions. The presence of the tumor led to a significant increase in serum CK and AST activities and in the concentrations of total globulin and the gamma-globulin fraction, and to a decrease in the albumin and alpha2-globulin levels. The polysaccharide extracts of A. blazei reduced the serum AST and ALT activities, probably due to a hepatoprotective effect. In addition, polysaccharide and supernatant extracts inhibited the tumor-induced increase in gamma-globulin levels. Thus, the supernatant and polysaccharide fractions of the extract of A. blazei have potential for use in complementary antineoplastic treatments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19901/18595,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Therefore, this work aimed to study the rheological properties and water adsorption of mixed flours of broken rice and barley bagasse obtained by extrusion cooking. Samples were prepared from a mixture of grits/bagasse between 82/18 and 73/27 (w/w) with water content between 18.04 and 26.96%, using a single screw extruder. The rheological properties of the extruded flour were determined by a rapid viscosity analyzer to evaluate the cooking profile of the pastes by observing the pasting temperature, maximum viscosity, breakdown and retrogradation. The adsorption process was performed by weighing the samples stored at temperatures of 25, 30, 35 and 45 °C with water activity between 0.112 and 0.973. The isotherms were fitted using the following mathematical models: Halsey, Oswin, Smith, GAB and Peleg. The extruded composite flours were characterized by their lack of initial viscosity. The pasting temperature (40-67 °C), maximum viscosity (690-1146 cP), breakdown viscosity (0-175 cP) and retrogradation (613-1382 cP) were lower than for raw rice flour. The Peleg equation fitted well to the water adsorption data and can be used to represent the sigmoidal type II shape of the water adsorption isotherms for the extruded mixed flours from rice grits and barley bagasse.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20979/18593,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Physical and chemical characteristics of common bean varieties,"The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most widely consumed legumes in the world, but nevertheless different varieties vary with respect to their physical and chemical aspects. This study evaluated the physical and chemical characteristics (color, hardness after cooking, water absorption capacity, cooking time, integrity of the beans after cooking, proximate composition and mineral composition) of the following varieties of the common bean: Carioca, IAPAR 81, Saracura, Juriti, Pérola, Colibri and IAPAR 31, all destined for both the internal Brazilian and external markets. The varieties studied had different proximate compositions and contents of the following minerals: K, Ca, N, Mg, S, Cu, Fe and Mn; but identical contents of P, Zn and B. The beans were classified as small in size. The Carioca variety showed the lowest values for L* (41.29) and H* (57.22), and the highest values for a* (12.17), its beans being redder and darker than the others. The Saracura variety showed the lowest degree of hydration (95.70 g/100g), cooking time (22.67 min.) and whole beans after cooking (30%), while the Pérola variety showed the highest values for these same parameters, 106.77 g/100g, 43.67 min. and 82.16%, respectively. No correlation was observed between the calcium and magnesium contents of the beans and the hardness of the raw bean, degree of hydration during maceration, cooking time and integrity of the cooked beans.

37,2016,Saline-sodic soil and organic matter addition in the cultivation of the colored cotton ‘BRS Topázio’,"The prevailing climate of the semiarid region in the northeastern region of Brazil along with inadequate irrigation management, have caused the formation of halomorphic soils, which have hampered agricultural production and environmental sustainability of this region. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence and initial growth of the cotton cultivar ‘BRS Topázio’ cultivated in soil with different levels of exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and concentrations of organic matter (OM) in a greenhouse from April to June 2014. The experiment was set in a randomized block design in a 5 × 4 factorial scheme, with three replicates, and the treatments consisted of five ESP levels (13.6, 22.4, 30.1, 39.0, and 48.0) and four OM concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 15% based on soil volume). Soils with an ESP ranging from 13.6 to 48.0 did not interfere with the emergence and number of leaves of cotton at 10 days after seeding (DAS). At 44 DAS, in the period preceding the flowering stage, ESPs ranging from 27 to 30 promoted greater plant height, stem diameter, and shoot fresh and dry matter. Increasing OM increased the emergence percentage and emergence speed index and, at 44 DAS, increased plant height, stem diameter, and shoot fresh and dry matter. Increasing OM mitigated the effect of the exchangeable sodium up to an ESP of 30 on the number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf area at 10 DAS, and up to mean ESPs of 28.5 and 34.0 for the number of leaves and leaf area, respectively, at 44 DAS.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20992/18590,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Depth-stratified soil sampling for assessing nematode communities,"This study assessed the importance of stratified soil sampling on the detection (and therefore the distribution) of nematode communities and the differentiation of ecosystems by collecting stratified soil samples at intervals of 10 cm and non-stratified samples from 0 to 30 cm in two soil management systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage) and in a native forest fragment. The nematode frequency and prominence values were obtained after extraction by successive screening operations, sugar floatation clarification and the identification of nematodes to the genus level. The nematode communities were compared two-by-two based on Sorensen’s community coefficient (CC) and the percentage similarity (PS). Relative abundances of functional guilds were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) and classified in dendrograms. Thirty-two edaphic nematode genera were found, and the nematode communities sampled on a non-stratified basis in the soil profile exhibited a high level of similarity because they could not be accurately characterized. Genera with low abundances were not detected. In the stratified samples, we were able to classify and group the nematodes present at different depths, mainly from 0 to 10 cm. Stratified soil sampling allowed a more accurate characterization and greater differentiation of nematode communities, identifying taxa that occurred at lower abundance levels, irrespective of frequency.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23060/18591,E-ISSN 1679-0359

So, the objective of this work was to evaluate the possibility of getting germination results of B. humidicola seeds in a shorter period. The procedures consisted in submitting the seeds to a dormancy breaking treatment and to alternating temperatures during the germination test. Seed samples of nineteen S1 and S2 seed lots were submitted to the following treatments: moistening the germination substratum with 1) deionized water (check treatment), 2) a KNO3 (0.2%) solution, and 3) scarifying the seeds with sulfuric acid for 10 minutes. The germination test was conducted under the conditions of 1) alternating temperatures of 20 and 35 °C and 2) alternating temperatures of 15 and 35 °C both with 8 hours of light. Normal seedlings were evaluated in daily countings. The results showed that the germination test of B. humidicola seeds may be carried out under alternating temperatures of 15 and 35 °C without breaking seed dormancy with a final evaluation of the germination 10 days after the sowing of the seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20984/18589,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Desde há estudos científicos têm analisado as condições pós-colheita ideais para sementes de jatobá-do-cerrado, este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a qualidade física e química de sementes de jatobá-do-cerrado seguindo diferentes tipos de processamento: com polpa, sem polpa (escarificação ), sem polpa (fermentação) e em temperaturas diferentes de armazenamento (10 e 23 ° C) e embalagens diferentes (tetrapack, papel, plástico, garrafas PET e garrafas de vidro), com mais de seis meses. Os componentes físicos e químicos de sementes de jatobá-do-cerrado variou de acordo com as condições de embalagem. Um aumento do tempo de armazenamento reduzido a qualidade das sementes. Sementes com polpa apresentou melhores características físicas durante o armazenamento. O processamento de polpa de sementes por escarificação mecânica aumentou o teor de acidez e cinzas, mas levou à maior porcentagem de proteína bruta durante o armazenamento a 23 ° C. O método de fermentação da polpa da semente afetou positivamente a qualidade das sementes durante o armazenamento a 10 ° C. embalagens permeáveis (sacos de papel e tetrapack) levou a uma maior redução na qualidade das sementes do que em garrafas de vidro, garrafas PET ou sacos de plástico. As melhores condições para o processamento de sementes de jatobá-do-cerrado foi fermentação e a melhor condição de armazenamento foi em embalagens impermeáveis (de vidro ou garrafas PET).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20944/18587,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Characterization of the hydraulic performance of self-compensating emitters with water of different salt concentrations,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate hydraulic characteristics such as manufacturing and flow variation coefficient, characteristic equation of self-compensating emitters and the variation between nominal flow and that obtained by the emitter equation using waters of different salt concentrations. The research was conducted in the greenhouse of the Academic Unit of the Agricultural Engineering, Federal University of Campina Grande-PB. Treatments consisted of five salinity levels in the irrigation water (ECwi) (0.6; 1.5; 2.5; 3.5 and 4.5 dS m-1 at 25 ° C) and four working pressures (60, 100, 140, and 160 kPa), with three replicates. The flow variations of emitters were considered small over time, being within recommendation of ± 7% of the nominal flow with “x” exponent values between 0.02 and 0.09, as recommended by the manufacturer, which was classified as self-compensating. The manufacturing and flow variation coefficients were considered excellent in all evaluations and the operating time did not influence the hydraulic performance of emitters. At pressure of 60 kPa and electric conductivity of 0.6 dS m-1, flow rates near values provided by the manufacturer and more economically viable to the farmer were obtained.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20923/18584,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Physiological performance and electrophoretic pattern of isoenzymes in Phaseolus vulgaris Lam. seeds treated with essential oil of Moringa oleifera Lam,"In order to investigate the effect of different doses of essential oil of Moringa oleifera (EOM) on physiological potential and the expression of isoenzymes in bean seeds, an experiment was conducted with two cultivars (Colibri and Campos Gerais) and seven treatments (bactericidal, fungicide and the doses 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8% EOM). Germination, first count of germination, germination speed index (GSI), emergence and emergence rate index (ERI) were evaluated in addition to the enzymes esterase (EST), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and isocitrate lyase (ICL) by electrophoresis. In an experiment conducted in the laboratory, the dose containing 0.4% EOM promoted germination and higher averages for first germination in seeds and GSI in the Colibri cultivar. However, the highest dose used (0.8%) was responsible for the worst physiological performance by the cultivar. For Campos Gerais, increasing doses of essential oil stimulated germination, first count of germination and GSI. In the field, higher doses of essential oil gave higher germination percentages for the Colibri cultivar, not influencing the seeds of Campos Gerais. The ERI was not altered by the treatments with OEM and changes in the molecular forms of the isoenzymes were observed, with low expression values of bands for EST, ICL and ADH-related vigor, the germination of both cultivars, as well as increased expression of SOD, which is associated with reductions in germination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20921/18583,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Phosphorus fractions in an agricultural chronosequence under tillage regimes in the Cerrado area in Goiás, Brazil","The increase in the amount and quantity of soil organic matter (SOM), as well as the use of phosphorus-based fertilizers in the superficial soil layer in areas under tillage regimes (TR), may affect phosphorus (P) dynamics in the soil. Therefore, the aims of the present work were as follows: to evaluate the inorganic and organic fractions of P and its lability levels (labile, moderately labile, and moderately resistant) in a Distroferric Red Latosol under tillage regimes (TR) 3, 15, and 20 years after implementation, and to compare them with those of areas of native Cerrado and pastures. We also focus on analyzing the correlations of the P fractions in these areas with other soil attributes, such as total carbon and nitrogen levels, light organic matter (LOM), chemical and physical granulometric fractions of the SOM, maximum phosphate adsorption capacity (MPAC), and the remaining phosphorus (Prem). In each of these areas, samples were collected from the 0.0-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m soil layers. An entirely randomized experimental design was used. After TR implementation, the constant use of phosphorus-based fertilizers as well as the incremental addition of SOM resulted in an increase in the levels of labile, moderate labile, and moderately resistant organic and inorganic P, with a tendency for total P accumulation to be mostly in the inorganic, moderately labile form. The native Cerrado soil presented high levels of labile and moderately labile inorganic P. Pasture areas presented the lowest levels of labile organic and inorganic P, as well as moderately labile and moderately resistant organic P. By principal component analysis (PCA), it was possible to observe alterations in all soil attributes and P levels of the fractions analyzed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20461/18582,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Densimetric fractionation of organic matter in an agricultural chronosequence in no-till areas in the Cerrado region, Brazil","Mineralization of organic residues deposited on the soil surface in a no-till system (NT) maintains a continuous flow of different forms of carbon (C), which might interfere with densimetric fractions of soil organic matter (SOM). Currently, there are few studies on variations in these fractions in NT areas with different deployment times in the Cerrado region. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the total C, nitrogen (N), and 13C in the soil, as well as to quantify the mass and contents of C, N, and 13C in the light and heavy fractions of SOM extracted using different solutions (water, sodium iodide [NaI], and sodium polytungstate [SPT]) in areas of Cerrado, pastures, and NT with different deployment times with Distroferric Red Latosol soil. The study areas are located in Montividiu, Goiás (GO), Brazil: (1) pasture of Brachiaria decumbens (PA); (2) NT with three years of deployment with soybean in summer and fallow instead of a second crop (NT3); (3) NT with 15 years of deployment with soybean in the summer and maize/sorghum as the second crop (NT15); and (4) NT with 20 years of deployment with soybean in the summer and maize as the second crop (NT20). These areas were compared to an area of native Cerrado sensu stricto (CE). The NT according to the deployment time showed an increase in the contents of C (0-0.05 m) and N (0-0.2 m) in the soil. The origin of C in the soil of the NT areas is associated with C4 plants; however, in up to 0.2 m of the soil profile, the 13C contents reduced according to NT deployment years. Extraction of light-fraction organic matter (LFOM) with SPT better represents this SOM fraction quantitatively and qualitatively than extraction of LFOM with water and NaI. This pattern is evident because of a greater consistency in the mass, C, N, and 13C contents of the LFOM extracted with SPT among the evaluated areas and the lower C content in residual particulate organic matter among the extractants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20459/18581,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,In vitro multiplication of pear tree cultivar Cascatense,"One main obstacle to the development and expansion of pear tree cultivation in Brazil has been the lack of cultivars adapted to the edaphoclimatic conditions of regions with the potential for pear production. Intending to overcome this hindrance, Embrapa Clima Temperado (Embrapa Temperate Climate) developed and released the cultivar Cascatense, with a low cold requirement (~400 h) better suited for Rio Grande do Sul`s and Santa Catarina`s climate. Still, seedlings of high genetic and sanitary quality are necessary for the establishment of a high-yield orchard. Plants with both sanitary quality and uniformity can be obtained through in vitro micropropagation. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the influence of different culture media (MS, MS¾, WPM, QL, and Himédia), concentrations of sucrose (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 g L-1), and concentrations of benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mg L-1) upon the in vitro multiplication of cultivar Cascatense, to establish an efficient protocol to enhance its propagation and reproducibility. The study included three sequential experiments in which the number of shoots per explant, the length of shoots, the number of axillary buds per shoot, fresh mass, and dry mass of shoots were evaluated. Cultivar Cascatense can be best propagated in vitro with the use of Himédia medium, supplemented with 0.8 mg L-1 of BAP and 30 g L-1 of sucrose.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20385/18580,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Emergence, growth, and flowering of castor beans as a function of the cationic composition of irrigation water","The use of saline water in agriculture has contributed to the expansion of irrigated areas, especially in arid and semiarid regions, where water deficits occur during various months of the year. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence, growth, and flowering of the castor bean cultivar “BRS Energia” as a function of the cationic composition of irrigation water, including water containing single and multiple types of cations. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in the municipality of Campina Grande-PB, Brazil using drainage lysimeters filled with a sandy loam Ultisol. The experiment was set in a randomized block design, with four replicates each of six water salinity treatments: Control; Na+; Ca2+; Na+ + Ca2+; K+; and Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2, totaling 24 experimental plots, each consisting of five plants. Plants in the control treatment were subjected to irrigation using water having low electrical conductivity (ECw = 0.6 dS m-1), while the plants receiving other treatments were irrigated using 4.5 dS m-1 water containing different ions. Emergence and growth were more affected by the ECw than by the cationic composition of the irrigation water. The order of the cations in the irrigation water, in terms of negative effects, was Na+ > Na+ + Ca+ > Ca2+ > Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+ > K+. The cationic composition of the irrigation water influenced the time interval for inflorescence development and the opening of flower buds of the castor bean cultivar “BRS Energia”, and the most pronounced effects were observed in plants irrigated with calcic water.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20942/18586,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Antioxidant activity and fermentative metabolism in the plant Erythrina crista-galli L. under flood conditions,"This study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of flood tolerance of the root system of Erythrina crista-galli L. plants by measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress components in the leaves and roots. Additionally, the activity of fermentation enzymes in the roots was measured. The following two treatments were used: plants with flooded roots, which were maintained at a given water level above the soil surface, and non-flooded plants, which were used as the control. The measurements were performed at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days after treatment. The following parameters were evaluated at each time-point: the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, the quantification of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in the leaves, roots, and adventitious roots, and the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in both the primary and adventitious roots. There was an increase in the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase in the leaves to maintain stable H2O2 levels, which reduced lipid peroxidation. In the roots, higher activity of all antioxidant enzymes was observed at up to 30 days of flooding, which favoured both reduced H2O2 levels and lipid peroxidation. Activity of the fermentation enzymes was observed in the primary roots from the onset of the stress conditions; however, their activity was necessary only in the adventitious roots during the final periods of flooding. In conclusion, E. crista-galli L. depends on adventitious roots and particularly on the use of the fermentation pathway to tolerate flood conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20376/18579,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Allelopathy by extracts of Caatinga species on melon seeds,"The melon crop is of great socioeconomic importance in Brazil and some species from the Caatinga biome show allelopathic effects on other species. The aim of this study was to assess leaf and seed extracts of cumaru (Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm.), the jujube tree (Zizyphus joazeiro Mart.), Jucá (Caesalpinia ferrea Mart. Ex. Tul. Var. Ferrea) and mulungu (Erythrina velutina Willd.) on the emergence of melon seeds (Cucumis melo L.). Leaves and seeds were used to produce extracts for each species at concentrations of a) 1%, b) 0.5% c) 0.25%, d) 0.125% and e) 0% (control). The experiment was conducted with each extract type and its respective concentrations in a completely randomized design, with four replicates, each of 20 seeds. The percentage emergence and rate index, percentage of abnormal seedlings, seedling dry matter and seedling shoot and root length were assessed. Seed extracts of A. cearensis prevented melon germination, whereas the other extracts had no effect on this variable. Leaf extracts of A. cearensis and leaf and seed extracts of Z. joazeiro, C. ferrea and E. velutina resulted in abnormal melon seedlings. The percentage of abnormal melon seedlings exceeded 30% when treated with C. ferrea seed extract at the highest concentration. Most extracts did not affect seedling dry matter, but E. velutina leaf and seed extract increased the dry matter accumulation of melon seedlings and Z. joazeiro seed extract decreased dry matter accumulation at a concentration of 0.25%. The highest concentrations of mulungu and jucá leaf extracts promoted the shoot growth of melon seedlings. The extract from E. velutina seeds negatively affected root length compared to the control, similar to the effect of C. ferrea and E. velutina leaf extracts at the highest concentrations. Extracts of different organs of Caatinga plants can affect the emergence and characteristics related to seedling growth, depending on the concentration. Most extracts did not affect germination or the emergence rate index, but affected seedling growth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19827/18577,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Genetic divergence among pumpkin landraces,"Estimating the genetic variability in germplasm collections is important not only for conserving genetic resources, but also for plant breeding purposes. However, generating a large number of different categories data (qualitative and quantitative) often complicate the analysis and results interpretation, resulting in an incomplete distinction of accessions. This study reports the characterization and evaluation of 14 pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) accessions collected from farms in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro state. Genetic diversity among accessions was also estimated using qualitative and quantitative variables considering joint analysis. The plants were grown under field conditions in a randomized block design with three replications and six plants per plot. Eight qualitative traits (leaf size; seed shape; seed color; color of the fruit pulp; hollow; fruit shape; skin color, and fruit skin texture) and eight quantitative traits (fruit weight; fruit length; fruit diameter; soluble solids, 100 seed weight, and wall thickness measured in the middle and in the lower stem) were evaluated. The data were analyzed considering the Gower distance, and cluster analysis was performed using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Variability among accessions was observed considering morphoagronomic data. The Gower distance together with UPGMA cluster allowed for good discrimination between accessions in the groups, demonstrating that the simultaneous analysis of qualitative and quantitative data is feasible and may increase the understanding of the variation among accessions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19149/18575,E-ISSN 1679-0359

36,2015,Continuous infusion of propofol at variable rates in a time dependent in cats,"Felines biotransforms propofol slowly developing cumulative effect. The aim this study was to develop a scheme of continuous infusion of propofol at time dependent variable rate in cats. Sixteen healthy female cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy and received as premedication dexmedetomidine (2.5 ?g/kg), methadone (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administrated at intramuscular rote. After 15 minutes , the animals were allocated into two groups : Fixed Rate (GFR), which received propofol 4mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion (CI ) at the rate of 0.3 mg/kg/min for 60 minutes; and Variable Rate (GVR) receiving the same induction protocol exchange with the IC starting at 0.3 mg/ kg/min for 10 minutes, 0.25 mg/kg/min up to 25 minutes, 0.2 mg/ kg/min up to 45 minutes and 0.15 mg/kg /min to 60 min of infusion based on simulation STAMPUMP®. We evaluated the cardiac frequency (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and maintenance of anesthesia during 60 minutes of infusion , as well as time to extubation, sternal recumbency and to full recovery. We observed similar anesthesia in both groups, but the GVR was used propofol least 30% for maintenance anesthesia. There was a reduction of HR and f in both groups after induction, with one animal the GFR developed apnea during all periods evaluated . Decreased SBP in GFR at all times in relation to the baseline, as the GVR, SBP decreased in just a moment. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to time to extubation (GFR 43.2 ± 19.5 min and 30.7 ± 13.2 min GVR) , deambulation ( GFR 60.7 ± 29.6 min and 41.6 ± GVR 17.2 min ) and total recovery (GFR 136 ± 34.3 min and 101.5 ± 29.6 min GVR) . We conclude that the two techniques keeps similar anesthetic plans, being safe for use in cats, and that the rate has varied propofol consumption 30 % lower.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/16479/16193,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Nonunion fractures in small animals - A literature review,"Bone nonunion is observed when the healing of a fracture fails and all processes of biologic repair cease. It is a frequent complication during fracture treatment in small animals. Nonunions are classified as viable or nonviable, and most cases result from technical error (e.g., inadequate or inappropriate choice of the type of stabilization), poor vascularization, excessive distance between the fragments, infection, and systemic disease, or local as well as idiopathic factors. The diagnosis is made when there is no radiographic evidence of bone healing. This condition cannot be treated conservatively; rather, nonunions require surgical intervention involving removal of implants (besides exuberant callus removal), proper alignment, and compression of the fracture site. As bone nonunion remains a common problem in clinical practice, the objective of this paper is to review the pathophysiology and methods for treating of the condition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22510/19777,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Haemorrhagic myelomalacia in a cat with extradural T-cell lymphoma,"Myelomalacia is a term used to indicate the softening of the spinal cord, which results from ischaemic or haemorrhagic necrosis that can occur as a sequel to acute spinal cord injury. A 10-month-old, female, mixed breed domestic cat exhibiting neurological symptoms was referred for evaluation. Neurological examination revealed symptoms consistent with thoracolumbar syndrome. Initial radiographic examination detected no changes of the thoracolumbar spine. The cat received a palliative treatment of and prednisolone. The patient did not respond to the treatment and one month later presented with worsening of symptoms that progressed to non-ambulatory paraplegia. Radiographic examination was performed a second time and revealed a mass inside the spinal canal at the L1 and L3 vertebral levels. The animal died and was sent for post-mortem examination. The necropsy revealed a greyish-white epidural mass inside the spinal canal that was compressing the spinal cord at the L1 and L3 vertebral levels. The spinal cord between T2 and L3 was reddish and friable. The pancreaticoduodenal lymph node was enlarged. Histologically, the spinal cord mass and pancreaticoduodenal lymph node presented neoplastic lymphocyte proliferation, and haemorrhagic myelomalacia was observed in the spinal cord from T2 to L3. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the neoplastic lymphocytes were positive for CD3 antibody (T-cell lymphoma), and the lymphoid organs showed immunostaining for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). Haemorrhagic myelomalacia due to extradural lymphoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cats with spinal neurological signs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22669/20602,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Adipose tissue as mesenchymal stem cells source in equine tendinitis treatment,"Tendinitis is an important high-relapse-rate disease, which compromises equine performance and may result in early athletic life end to affected animals. Many therapies have been set to treat equine tendinitis; however, just few result in improved relapse rates, quality of extracellular matrix (ECM) and increased biomechanical resistance of the treated tissue. Due to advances in the regenerative medicine, promising results were initially obtained through the implantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from the bone marrow in the equine tendon injury. Since then, many studies have been using MSCs from different sources for therapeutic means in equine. The adipose tissue has appeared as feasible MSC source. There are promising results involving equine tendinitis therapy using mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (AdMSCs).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22743/20101,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Tricuspid valve dysplasia in a domestic feline: case report,"Tricuspid valve dysplasia (TVD) is a congenital heart defect described in dogs and cats; however, in Brazil there are no reports of this condition in cats. Therefore, our goal was to report a case of TVD in a domestic cat. A four-year-old, female, domestic short hair cat that was seen at the Cardiology Service of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of São Paulo, for apathy, appetite loss and dyspnea for five days. During physical examination, dyspnea with a restrictive respiratory pattern due to pleural effusion was observed. Thoracocentesis was performed and 450 mL of serosanguineous fluid was drained. Two-dimensional echocardiography in the right parasternal short-axis plane at the level of the papillary muscles showed right ventricular dilatation and paradoxical septal motion. On the left parasternal apical four-chamber view, significant dilatation of the right chambers, loss of mobility of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and a thickened mural leaflet chordae with anomalous insertion were observed. Based on clinical and echocardiographic aspects, a diagnosis of TVD was given. Treatment was initiated with enalapril 0.5 mg/kg, furosemide 0.5 mg/kg and pimobendan 0.3 mg/kg every 12 hours, all per os. The patient experienced remission of clinical manifestations and survived for 50 days after diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21172/20844,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Change in energy metabolism of in vitro produced embryos: an alternative to make them more cryoresistant?,"For the development of in vitro produced (IVP) as well as in vivo produced bovine embryos, it is extremely important that their energy metabolism works properly because the embryo must be able to metabolize energy substrates that are necessary for producing energy. Lipids play an important role in early embryonic development, acting as source of energy for oocytes and embryos. However, it is known that oocytes and embryos, mainly IVP, accumulate large amounts of lipids in the cytoplasm. Although they are extremely important in embryonic development, lipids have been associated with the reduced survival of bovine embryos following cryopreservation. There is evidence that at least four different categories of lipids affect embryo survival after cryopreservation, including triglycerides (TAG), free fatty acids, cholesterol and phospholipids. Thus, many studies are being conducted to improve the resistance of IVP embryos to the cryopreservation process by reducing the concentration or removing the source of serum from the medium or by reducing oocyte/embryo lipids using mechanical or chemical means. Regarding the use of delipidating agents that reduce the uptake and synthesis of fatty acids (FA) by cells, substances such as phenazine ethosulfate (PES), forskolin, L-carnitine and isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have been utilized. This review aims to address important issues related to embryonic energy metabolism, the importance of lipid metabolism and its relation to the cryopreservation of IVP bovine embryos by summarizing the latest research in this field.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26534/21400,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Use of a five-day progesterone-based timed artificial insemination protocol for dairy water buffaloes,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a short five-day (5 d) progesterone-based timed artificial insemination (TAI) protocol on the time of ovulation and fertility in dairy water buffaloes. In experiment 1, 30 dairy buffaloes were subjected to one of two estrous synchronization protocols. Females in the control group (n=17) were administered 2 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB), and an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device (CIDR) was inserted on day -12. On day -3, CIDR inserts were removed and all cows were treated with 150 ?g of D-cloprostenol (a PGF2?-analogue). Forty-eight hours after CIDR removal, all cows received 100 µg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Females assigned to the short 5 d group (n=13) received treatment similar to the control group, except that the CIDR device was inserted on day -8, and the EB treatment was eliminated. In experiment 2, 51 dairy buffaloes were separated into control (n=27) and short 5 d (n=24) groups that received the same treatment as described for cows in experiment 1, except that all females were inseminated 16 to 18 h after GnRH injection. The use of a short 5 d progesterone-based TAI protocol with or without treatment with EB on day 0 did not affect the time of ovulation and pregnancy per artificial insemination in lactating water buffaloes. Thus, we suggest that the short 5 d TAI protocol may be successfully used as an alternative to induce ovulation in dairy buffaloes, with the particular advantages of avoiding EB treatment and a shorter interval from the beginning of the protocol to TAI.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30193/22296,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Pearl millet grain for beef cattle in crop-livestock integration system: intake and digestibility,"The present study aimed to evaluate the nutritional parameters (intake and digestibility) of beef cattle in two genetic groups fed protein-energy supplements formulated by different levels of replacement of maize with pearl millet grain during the dry season. Sixty-four uncastrated young bulls, with an average age of 20 months and an initial body weight of 388 ± 26 kg, were included in the study. The experimental area consisted of four paddocks approximately 4.7 ha in size, composed of Brachiaria brizantha ‘Marandu’ within a crop-livestock integration system. The study was based on a completely randomized factorial design (2×4). Two genetic groups (Crossbred and Nellore) and the effects of replacement of maize with pearl millet grain at 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% in the supplement formulations were assessed. No significant effects were observed in the genetic groups and with the replacement of maize with pearl millet grain, as well as in the pasture total dry matter (DM) and nutrients intake, or the coefficients of total digestibility of nutrients. The dietary concentration of digested organic matter was not influenced by the replacement levels of pearl millet grain, with values of 514.88, 515.76, 516.01, and 515.98 g kg-1 of DM recorded for the 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% replacement levels, respectively. Therefore, pearl millet grain can be utilized as a partial or total substitute for maize grain as the energetic ingredient in concentrated supplements for Nellore and crossbred beef cattle in pastures managed in crop-livestock integration systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26316/21070,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,The green turtle Chelonia mydas as a marine and coastal environmental sentinels: anthropogenic activities and diseases,"The green turtle Chelonia mydas is a widely distributed, slowly maturing species with a complex life cycle, using both oceanic and coastal environments. The species is exposed to different threats and is considered an environmental sentinel that indicates variation among, and the severity of hazards to marine ecosystems. This study aimed to describe both anthropogenic impacts, and infectious and parasitic diseases in C. mydas - including cases along the Brazilian coast - and implications for conservation. Bycatch is reported as the main threat to the conservation of this species, followed by debris ingestion, collisions with boats, dredging, and chronic environmental contamination. All of these impacts may directly or indirectly cause death, by facilitating contact with pathological agents and by increasing vulnerability to secondary diseases. The pathological agents associated with lesions include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. Fibropapillomatosis is an example of a chronic disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral tumors that affects mostly juvenile C. mydas worldwide and is associated with the Chelonid herpesvirus 5. The bacterias Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas fluorescens are found in the aquatic environment and among C. mydas lesions in various organs. Trematode adults and eggs of the family Spirorchiidae are also frequent in systemic cardiovascular diseases of C. mydas. The direct impacts of anthropogenic activities and diseases are synergistic and may affect the specie’s health and conservation. Therefore, the monitoring and systematic diagnosing of diseases and causes of death - including necropsy, histopathology, and molecular exams - are necessary to assess a population’s health, to support appropriate decisions of coastal management and to target future research topics that optimize C. mydas conservation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28895/21851,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Development of digestive organs of female broilers under varying post-hatch fasting times,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of post-hatch fasting time on the weights of body and digestive organs of chicks. Fertile eggs from 62-week-old broiler breeders (Cobb Fast lineage) were incubated and, after hatching, female chicks were randomly divided into six treatments, which corresponded to fasting periods (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours), with 40 chicks per treatment. At 01, 03, 06, and 10 days after hatching, measurements of body weight; residual yolk weight; relative weights of proventriculus + gizzard, intestine + pancreas and liver; and intestine total length were made. At 6 days of age, the chicks submitted to post-hatch fasting, for up to 12 hours, demonstrated greater development, with body weights higher than the other birds. Yet, when fed, no compensatory gain was observed and, at 10 days of age, the birds submitted to 48- and 72-h fasting remained with a lower body development. Intestine growth was also compromised by post-hatch fasting, being reduced in both weight and length. A post-hatching fasting of up to 24 hours did not interfere with the weights of body and digestive organs of 10-day-old female broiler chickens. However, 48- and 72-h post-hatch fastings affected adversely the weight and growth of digestive organs in the birds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30091/23305,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Ultrasound in the postharvest treatment of grapes: impact on the extractability and phenolic composition of juice and wine,"Ultrasound has gained attention from the food industry because its properties, including chemical and physical reactions, enable a wide range of commercial applications. One of the most popular applications is the optimization of extraction of bioactive substances. Among the most recent applications is its use in postharvest of fruits and vegetables, wherein ultrasound functions as a possible elicitor agent promoting the synthesis of phenolic compounds. These substances are important in defining the chemical and sensory characteristics of juices, wines and other grape products because the concentration and extraction capacity of these compounds in grapes directly influence the product quality. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the application of ultrasound in American and vinifera grapes of different harvests with regard to its effects on fruit extractability and concentration of phenolic compounds in elaborated juice and wine. The results indicated that, under certain conditions, ultrasound could lead to a significant increase in the anthocyanin concentration in ‘Isabella’ grapes and its juice. On the other hand, in ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ grapes, most of the treatments did not indicate positive results in the tested parameters and tended to promote degradation of anthocyanins at significant levels. However, the observed effects varied depending on the harvest conditions and cultivar characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29925/23049,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Antimicrobial activity of species Zingiber officinale Roscoe and Alpinia purpurata (Vieill.) K. Schum. (Zingiberaceae) - Review,"The functionality of nutraceutical foods is attributed to their bioactive compounds. These compounds are widely produced by plants, such as phenolic compounds, which have antioxidant activity and/or antimicrobial activity, acting against damage to macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Secondary plant metabolites, including classes such as phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and terpenoids, have a wide variety of biological activities with medicinal potential. These secondary metabolites are considered bioactive compounds. The Zingiberaceae family received special attention for their large bioactive compound production. Such compounds are useful in foods as herbs, spices, flavorings, and seasonings and in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries as antioxidants and antimicrobials. Gingers are recognized as safe by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), resulting in no side effects when consumed in moderate amounts. Recent studies show that, in addition to rhizomes, the leaves and flowers of some ginger species have antioxidant activity and consequent medicinal potential. Studies have demonstrated that in vitro and in vivo research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of ginger extracts and understand their role in the modulation of biological and molecular pathways, thus enabling the development of new therapeutic strategies. Thereby, the present work aims to provide a bibliographic review on the antimicrobial activity of Zingiber officinale Roscoe and Alpinia purpurata (Vieill.) K. Schum.

39,2018,"Canine visceral leishmaniasis in Londrina, Paraná - investigation and case report","Dogs are considered the main reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis for humans, which also present a chronic and severe clinical picture when affected. The objective of the present report was to describe a canine visceral leishmaniasis case diagnosed in Londrina, an indene city, and its investigation. A street animal with extensive dermatological lesions, onychogryphosis, mild anemia and leukopenia was attended at a veterinary hospital in Londrina, where positivity was reported for Leishmania spp. in serological tests. Cytology was positive in bone marrow, PCR and parasite culture were positive in skin, spleen, liver, lymph node and bone marrow, and DNA sequencing confirmed the species of the parasite as L. (L.) infantum. The official diagnosis was made by the Central Laboratory of Paraná (LACEN), and through an official report, an investigation of the case was started for the confirmation of autochthony. An active search for the vector and other canine cases in the neighborhood was carried out along with a search for information on the origin of the animal in question. However, the species, Lutzomyia longipalpis, new canine cases, or origin of the sick animal were not identified. Although, the present case cannot be confirmed as autochthonous, we suggest that it is necessary to disseminate the present report to serve as a warning to veterinarians and other public health professionals in the northern region of Paraná to be attentive to suspicious cases and to not fail to investigate these cases to the end.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31451/23582,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nasal peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor in a heifer: case report,"This report described the clinical signs, pathological and immunohistochemical findings associated with a peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) in the nasal cavity of a heifer. The heifer exhibited severe breathing difficulty and dysphagia, which were increased over the last thirty days. At autopsy, a large, firm, and whitish mass was found occupying the left frontal sinus and most of the left nasal cavity. Histologically, a malignant neoplastic proliferation was observed, which was composed of small cells typically arranged in nests and mantles, occasionally arranged in palisade, interspersed with moderate connective stroma. The neoplastic cells exhibited strong immunoreactivity to synaptophysin, mild, multifocal immunoreactivity to neuron-specific enolase and vimentin immunoreactivity, with moderate, and multifocal immunoreactivity S-100 protein. These findings suggest that pPNETs should be included in the differential diagnosis of proliferative and obstructive lesions in the nasal cavity of young cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28378/24002,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,"Prevalence and risk factors associated with Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi infections in dogs presented at veterinary clinics in João Pessoa, Paraíba state, northeastern Brazil","This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi infections in dogs presented at veterinary clinics in the city of João Pessoa, Paraíba state, northeastern Brazil. A total of 384 dogs from 34 veterinary clinics were sampled between April 2015 and May 2016. For serological diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, the indirect fluorescent antibody test was used. Reactive sera were submitted to a confirmatory test using the S7 ELISA. The seroprevalence of Leishmania spp. was 2.8% (11/384), and that of T. cruzi was 1.5% (6/384). Two animals were positive for both parasites. The variable “access to the street” was identified as a risk factor for Leishmania spp. infection (OR = 4.81; 95% CI = 1.23–18.75). We concluded that a significant proportion of dogs presented at veterinary clinics in João Pessoa are seropositive for Leishmania spp. or T. cruzi infections, and we suggest that greater care be taken with dogs that have access to the street.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32025/24272,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Histopathological findings and immunohistochemical staining of Neospora caninum infection in placentas of animals for slaughter,"Bovine neosporosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Neospora caninum, which is one of the main pathogens that cause abortions in cattle worldwide. It is responsible for large losses in dairy and beef cattle, especially with regard to the expenses associated with decreased productivity and increased discard. In the State of Maranhão, the occurrence of this parasite has already been confirmed in the dairy cattle of three microregions that make up the state’s dairy industry and in small ruminants of the municipalities of Amarante do Maranhão and Buritirana. This fact justifies the importance of determining the presence of N. caninum in cattle slaughtered in the slaughterhouses of the Island of São Luís, to help control the parasitic cycle in the cattle production system of the region under study, and the importance of its diagnosis. The objective of the research was to conduct a histopathological and immunohistochemical characterization of bovine placentas infected with N. caninum collected in slaughterhouses. Sixteen placenta samples from cows were randomly selected at the slaughterhouses of the city of São Luís for histological analysis and immunohistochemistry. Results showed that 31% of the placentas presented histopathological changes such as: inflammatory process, edema, hemorrhage and presence of hemosiderin. All slides with histopathological changes showed immunolabeling for N. caninum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30779/24271,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Hypoplasia of ribs associated with cleft palate, cleft lip, and unilateral renal agenesis in a neonate dog of undefined breed","Congenital defects can cause changes in the normal function or morphology of organs, thus contributing to neonatal mortality. Malformations in dogs occur as a result of genetic factors or by the action of teratogenic agents during pregnancy. Genetic defects can be inherited from one or both parents. These defects are more common in purebred puppies or can even be the result of consanguinity. Teratogenic agents, such as toxins, drugs, infectious diseases, mechanical influences, and irradiation, may affect the litters during gestational development. Hypoplasia of ribs has been described in human newborns. It is a rare and lethal malformation of autosomal recessive inheritance that prevents thoracic expansion and reduces pulmonary compliance, causing respiratory failure. A pregnant bitch of undefined breed was submitted to caesarean section. At birth, a neonate exhibited respiratory distress, and the palpation of the thorax indicated absence of ribs. In addition, the newborn had cleft palate and cleft lip, which led to perform the euthanasia of the animal. Post-mortem examination indicated hypoplasia of ribs and unilateral renal agenesis. As in the canine neonate, hypoplasia of ribs in human newborns is also associated with other malformations, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and urogenital defects. The present report describes the first case of hypoplasia of ribs associated with other malformations in a canine neonate, the cause being possibly related to a genetic hereditary factor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32176/25024,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Environmental aspects and diseases related to immunosuppression in cetaceans: a concise review,"The analysis of the health status of sentinel animals is a key element for the evaluation of ecosystem health conditions, since these animals respond to small and large scale changes in ecological factors and the quality of the environment. In the marine environment, the changes are systemic and accumulate impacts of coastal zones and oceanic activities, with aquatic mammals being species that reflect changes in biological and health parameters. For these animals several studies have reported an increase in the frequency and diversity of diseases, including infections by pathogens from the terrestrial environment. This increase may be related to impairment of the immune system activity of these organisms in response to potential synergistic factors. In cetaceans, immunosuppression may be caused by infection with viral agents, such as Morbillivirus, which induce severe lymphoid depletion and is responsible for several cases of mass mortality; chemical contamination, highlighting the organochlorines and trace elements (mainly mercury and cadmium); and even by chronic stress. Anthropic impacts are important stressors, and the consequences are more evident in animals of coastal habits, which leads to a constant release of glucocorticoid hormones and consequent lymphoid depletion, a mechanism similar to that occurring in terrestrial mammals. Immunosuppressed animals are susceptible to opportunistic diseases, some more severe and rare, with the risk of decline of populations. The objective of this review was to provide information on the aspects related to immunosuppression in cetaceans, associating etiological factors and pathological findings, and to highlight the relevance of the evaluation of the endocrine and immune system of marine animals as a reflection of the health status of marine ecosystems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28925/24606,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Emissions of an agricultural engine using blends of diesel and hydrous ethanol,"The growing global demand of energy, the decrease of petroleum reserves and the current of environmental contamination problems, make it imperative to study renewable energy sources for use in internal combustion engines, in order to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels and reduce emissions of pollutant gases. This study aimed to evaluate the emissions of a diesel-cycle engine of an agricultural tractor that uses diesel S500 (B5) mixed with 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15% of hydrous ethanol. It determined emissions of CO2 (ppm), NOx (ppm), and opacity (k value) of gases. A standard procedure was applied considering eight operating modes (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, and M8) by breaking with an electric dynamometer in a laboratory. The experimental design was completely randomized, with 60 replicates and a 6 x 8 factorial design. Greater opacity and gas emissions were observed when the engine operated with 3% ethanol, while lower emissions occurred with 12 and 15%. With these fuels, the reduction of opacity, CO2, and NOx, in relation to diesel oil, was 24.49 and 26.53%, 4.96 and 5.15%, and 6.59 and 9.70%, respectively. In conclusion, the addition of 12 and 15% ethanol in diesel oil significantly reduces engine emissions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31707/24982,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Atrophic gastritis in a Shih-Tzu dog - case report,"We report the case of a female Shih-Tzu dog with chronic vomiting and hematemesis not responsive to symptomatic treatment. Due to the non-specific clinical signs, the patient underwent endoscopy and biopsy of the gastric mucosa. Histopathological analysis revealed atrophic gastritis, a disease rarely reported in dogs and characterized by the destruction of parietal cells of the mucosa and their replacement by fibrosis. This analysis allowed an adequate treatment based on the administration of corticosteroids by the anti-inflammatory effects and action in the regeneration of parietal cells, associated with a soft, hypoallergenic diet formulated with a low fat content, low digestible fibers, and high contents of complex carbohydrates, which resulted in the resolution of the clinical condition in a few weeks. In a second endoscopy, performed after eight months of treatment, the gastric mucosa presented a pink color, regardless of the degree of distension, no lesions or discontinuity points. Fragments were collected for histopathological analysis, which confirmed the recovery of gastric lesions and restoration of the macroscopically healthy mucosa. Most gastric diseases require histological analysis for a definitive diagnosis. In this context, endoscopy has brought unquestioned benefits to the patient since it allowed an accurate diagnosis with a quick and safe collection of gastric mucosa samples.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31220/24605,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Insertion of an intrauterine catheter for post-cervical artificial insemination in gilts: a case report,"The aim of this case report was to characterize the insertion of an intrauterine catheter (IC) in gilts to perform post-cervical artificial insemination (PCAI). Attempts to insert ICs through the cervixes of gilts were performed using either a standard sow foam tip catheter (SFC; n = 25) or a standard gilt foam tip catheter (GFC; n = 25). The percentage of passage, depth and degree of difficulty for insertion were evaluated. The average depth of IC insertion was 10.1 ± 1.3 cm for SFC and 10.0 ± 1.2 cm for GFC. For both catheters, insertion depths of greater than 10 cm were achieved in the first insemination in 44% of gilts. Insertion depths of greater than 6 cm were observed in 72% and 60% of attempts using SFC and GFC, respectively. A high level of difficulty for IC insertion was observed, mainly while using GFC. In conclusion, the routine application of PCAI in gilts on swine farms remains limited by the low success rate for intrauterine catheter insertion. In further studies, we suggest evaluating reproductive performance using low insertion depths for PCAI in gilts, and assessing the use of sow foam tip catheter as a guide to introduce the IC.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28830/24616,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Thus, this study was structured with the aim of establishing the geospatial characterization of bat shelters in different semi-arid mesoregions of the state of Paraíba, Northeastern region of Brazil. Data provided by the Secretaria de Estado do Desenvolvimento da Agropecuária e da Pesca da Paraíba (SEDAP-PB), from 2007 to 2015 and data from digital platforms were used. The geographic representation was produced using the software QGIS 2.16.0 - Nodebo. To verify virus circulation sites, buffers were plotted within a 10-km radius from the registered shelters and rabies incidence sites in the state. A registry of 93 shelters in the period between 2007 and 2015 were distributed in 22 municipalities and 15 microregions. All mesoregions were represented, though 47.31% of the bat shelters were located in Agreste Paraibano. Of the total registered shelters, 66 (71%) are classified as artificial, and 27 (29%) as natural.

39,2018,Ultrasonographic measurement of collateral ligaments of the distal interphalangeal joint in Criollo horses,"Criollo horses were used in the past only for field services, especially countryside work. However, currently, they have been used as sports animals in several modalities involving turns in legs and exercises on irregular terrain, predisposing them to injuries in the distal extremity. Among the alterations recognized as cause of lameness in this region are the conditions related to collateral ligaments of the distal interphalangeal joint (CL-DIPJ), which in horses are structures that help to maintain joint stability and suffer a high pressure due to the high body weight, especially when it is not equally distributed at the stance phase. Considering the importance of the ultrasound anatomical knowledge of this structure for the early diagnosis of locomotive affections in the digit of Criollo horses, this study aimed to standardize CL-DIPJ measurements in healthy horses of this breed. We used 25 adult Criollo horses not submitted to sports practice. For ultrasonographic evaluation, after a trichotomy of the region, an ultrasound Chison 8300VET and a 6.0 MHz linear probe were used with a standoff pad. This technique uses a cross-sectional view, in which CL-DIPJ is visualized in the distal concavity portion of the middle phalanx, being a standard for the measurements. For ligament measurements, the variables dorsopalmar diameter (DPD), latero-medial diameter (LMD), and cross-sectional area (CSA) of ligaments were used. Three measurements were performed for each variable and average values were obtained, which were compared to each other and did not present significant differences (p > 0.05). The average measurements of diameter and area of collateral ligaments of the distal interphalangeal joint in Criollo horses were 9.04 mm for DPD, 7.55 mm for LMD, and 0.52 mm2 for CSA. This was the first study that standardized the size of this structure in this breed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32177/24602,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Biological activity of 7beta-acetoxywithanolide D isolated from Acnistus arborescens,"Many oomycete species are plant pathogens and are responsible for causing significant losses in agriculture. Currently, plant pathogen control is carried out by chemical, biological and physical methods. However, due to the development of resistance to these methods by some pathogens, it is imperative that alternative methods are developed. Brazilian biodiversity is well-known for its species richness and is considered a promising source of natural products. Among the vascular plants, the family Solanaceae A. Juss. (Solanaceae) is considered one of the largest, with distributions across all tropical and temperate regions of the world. The Solanaceae family presents a high diversity of species of economic importance as sources of food, medicinal and ornamental properties. Plants of this family are sources of secondary metabolites of various chemical classes that possess potential diverse applications. Therefore, chemical and biological investigations of these compounds are extremely important as they present alternatives for their potential use in the control of plant pathogens. Here, we report for the first time, the biological activity of 7beta-acetoxywithanolide D, a compound isolated from Acnistus arborescens, against the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi. With these results, we emphasize the importance of such studies on plant secondary metabolites, which may present coadjuvant options in the control of plant pathogens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31343/24599,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Farmers’ views on the use and management of soil and its relation to the return of erosion in non-tillage systems,"The non-tillage system (NTS), until now considered an effective management tool for the control of erosion, has gradually increased the loss of soil. The objective of this research is to identify and understand the probable causes of the return of erosion in rural properties under the NTS in three municipalities in northern Paraná. For this research, a questionnaire was used to collect information on soil management and the use of agricultural terraces. Data collection was completed with 145 landowners and NTS users, along with rural extension and agricultural cooperatives. The results demonstrated that the return of erosion is likely due to the absence of crop rotation in favor of repetitive year-to-year planting of the same plant species (early soybean/maize [second harvest]/wheat), soil revolving to decompress the surface layer, and the elimination of agricultural terraces and the consequential downslope planting.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33632/24600,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effects of mixed modes on fermentation quality and In vitro gas dynamics of sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense) silage,"Sorghum-sudangrass hybrid silage has poor fermentation characteristics owing to a high moisture content. Accordingly, a 3 × 4+1 factorial design was applied to investigate the effects of adding different types and amounts of hay (corn stalk, wheat straw, and alfalfa hay at 12.5 kg t-1, 25 kg t-1, 37.5 kg t-1, and 50 kg t-1) on the nutritive value, fermentation quality, 72 h dry matter digestibility, and gas dynamics in vitro to simulate the rumen fermentation of sorghum-sudangrass hybrid silage. Separated silage of sorghum-sudangrass hybrids had a high butyric acid content and a FLIEG’s scores evaluation ranking of only “Fair.” The addition of hay significantly improved the fermentation quality of mixed silage. With respect to hay type, adding wheat straw had the best fermentation quality, alfalfa hay had the best nutritive value, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) (662.41 g kg-1), constant fractional rate (C) (0.28 mL h-1), and the average gas production rate (AGPR) (32.70 mL h-1) content. There were no differences in the cumulative gas production at 72 h (GP72h), asymptotic gas production generated at a constant fractional rate (A), and lag time before gas production commenced (lag) among the three hay types. With respect to quantity, 25 kg t-1 hay had the best fermentation quality, 50 kg t-1 hay had the best nutritive value and highest IVDMD content (662.81 g kg-1), 37.5 kg t-1 hay had the highest C (0.28 mL h-1) and AGPR (31.48 mL h-1) contents, 25 kg t-1 hay had the highest Half time (2.20 h), and there were no significant differences in GP72h, A, and lag among the four amounts.

The experimental design was completely randomized design in a 3 × 6 factorial scheme with three replications, consisting of three soybean cultivars (6266 RSF IPRO, BMX Potência RR, and 14403Z6001) and six grain moisture contents (11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21% wb). Soybean grains presented an initial moisture content of 11.0, 11.0, and 10.8% wb, respectively for 6266 RSF IPRO, BMX Potência RR, and 14403Z6001. The other moisture contents were obtained by soaking in a BOD chamber maintained at 25 °C and 93% of relative humidity. We assessed volume, roundness, sphericity, surface area, volumetric shrinkage, and volumetric shrinkage rate. The data were submitted to the analysis of variance by the F-test (p < 0.05) and when significant, regression analysis was performed for grain moisture contents and the means of cultivars were compared by the Tukey’s test. Pearson’s correlation analysis was also carried out to represent the linearity between grain physical properties. The cultivar BMX Potência RR obtained the highest results for volume, roundness, sphericity, and surface area. Volume and surface area increased as the moisture content of soybean grains increased; the opposite was observed for roundness and sphericity. A linear increase in volumetric shrinkage was observed as moisture content increased. The values of the correlation coefficients of the linear regression models can be used to describe the relationships between physical properties.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26060/24598,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Comparison between lambs and goat kids meat production of animals fed Caatinga vegetation enriched with buffel (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) grass,"This study compared the performance and meat production of goat kids and lambs that were fed semi-arid Caatinga vegetation enriched with buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.). Twelve crossbred Boer × undefined breed goat kids and 12 Santa Inês lambs that had 20.7 kg of body weight (BW) were studied. Goat kids presented greater (P < 0.05) organic matter intake and digestibility, total gain, average daily gain (ADG) and perirrenal fat compared to lambs fed Caatinga vegetation enriched with buffel grass. However, the morphometric carcass measurements (external and leg length; chest and rump width; leg perimeter and chest circumference) were higher (P < 0.05) in lambs compared to those of goat kids. The crude protein and neutral detergent fiber intake and digestibility, cooling carcass loss, biological yield, empty body weight, hot carcass and cold carcass weights and yields, subcutaneous fat thickness, carcass compactness index and Longissimus dorsi area were similar (P > 0.05) between goat kids and lambs. Goat kids (crossbred Boer × undefined breed) more efficiently used Caatinga vegetation enriched with Cenchrus ciliaris L. than Santa Inês lambs; this vegetation improved nutrient intake, ADG and, consequently, feeding conversion. However, Santa Inês lambs presented higher carcass morphometric values.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32908/24596,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Additional effect of coated sodium butyrate 30% in the piglets feeding during the nursery phase,"In this study, the objective was to assess the growth performance, rectal microbiological profile, serum and immunological standards, and incidence of diarrhoea in piglets in the nursery phase fed diets with and without the addition of coated sodium butyrate 30% (SB). A total of 80 crossbred piglets (40 entire males and 40 females), with an average initial body weight of 9.47 ± 1.03 kg, were distributed in a randomised block design, with four treatments repeated twice in the two blocks and five piglets of the same gender per experimental unit. The treatments comprised a combination of two feeds, formulated based on corn and soybean meal with and without 0.1% SB inclusion as an additional product, and both genders, fed from of the pre-starter I diet. SB did not affect (p > 0.05) the growth performance and rectal microbiological profile of the piglets, but efficiently (p = 0.05) controlled the incidence of diarrhoea. The average values of the characteristics measured in the blood of the piglets were within the normal physiological parameters of the species. The inclusion of SB in commercial feed did not alter the growth performance and rectal microbiological profile of nursery piglets under low sanitary challenge conditions. However, the organic acid efficiently reduced gastrointestinal disorders that cause diarrhoea, with diarrhoea incidence rates of 2.68 and 4.46% for piglets fed with and without the inclusion of the additional organic acid, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32669/24594,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Rumen parameters and passage rate in cattle fed diets based on sugarcane hydrolyzed with calcium oxide,"Nine non-lactating Holstein x Gyr cattle were fed with rations based on chopped sugarcane supplied in natura (control) or hydrolyzed (fresh matter basis) for 24 h with 1% or 2% calcium oxide (CaO), which corresponds to 3.1% or 6.2% CaO on a dry matter (DM) basis, respectively. Ruminal parameters (pH and ammonia N, acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations) as well as the kinetics of fluid and particulate passage in the gastrointestinal tract from cattle were evaluated. A design using three 3 x 3 contemporaneous Latin Squares (LS) was adopted. The studies of kinetics of fluid and particulate passage were performed using the external markers cobalt-EDTA and chromium-mordanted-NDF, respectively. The ruminal parameters were analyzed according to a 3 x 3 LS replicated three times with repeated measures in time using mixed models that included the fixed effects of treatment (level of CaO), time of sampling and their interaction and the following random effects: LS, animal(LS), period of LS and period*animal (LS). The kinetic parameters of fluid and particulate passage were analyzed using mixed models with treatment as a fixed effect and period of LS, animal(LS) and LS as random effects. The linear and quadratic effects of the treatments were analyzed using orthogonal contrasts. Significant differences were declared at P ? 0.05. No treatment*time interaction was observed (P > 0.05) for any ruminal parameter. A linear effect (P = 0.0279) of CaO inclusion on ruminal pH was observed, but there were no effects (P > 0.05) of the treatments on the ammonia N, acetate, butyrate and total volatile fatty acid ruminal concentrations. There was a quadratic effect (P = 0.05) of the addition of CaO on the ruminal propionate concentration. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of the treatments on the particulate rate of passage in the rumen as well as on the mean retention time in this compartment and in the total gastrointestinal tract. On the other hand, the addition of CaO to sugarcane promoted a linear increase (P = 0.0258) in the particulate post-ruminal passage rate and, consequently, a linear reduction (P = 0.0363) of the mean retention time in the cecum-proximal colon. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of the sugarcane hydrolysis with CaO on the ruminal parameters of the kinetics of fluid passage (dilution rate, retention time and turnover rate). The addition of 3.1% or 6.2% CaO on a DM basis (1% or 2% CaO on a fresh matter basis, respectively) of sugarcane does not improve ruminal fermentation, nor does it increase the fluid or particulate passage in the rumen of non-lactating Holstein x Gyr cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32709/24595,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Roughage sources for Holstein cows under experimental feeding conditions in Brazil - a meta-analysis,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition, voluntary intake, and digestibility of the diet of Holstein cows, as well as milk yield and milk composition as a function of different roughage sources used under experimental feeding conditions in Brazil, through meta-analysis. The database of this study consisted of 109 experiments with 424 treatments of 3,903 lactating Holstein cows. The data were obtained from studies published between January 2000 and December 2015, and were evaluated by variance analysis. Lactating dairy cow diets with a single source of roughage other than corn silage resulted in lower voluntary intake, milk yield, and differences in milk composition, compared to diets based on corn silage or the combination of two roughages, probably due to reduced nutrient digestibility. Diets based on corn silage are distinguished by feed efficiency, milk yield, and composition. Diets based on the combination of two roughage sources are similar with respect to milk yield and composition, compared to diets based on corn silage; whereas, diets with a single source of roughage (other than corn silage), even when containing a higher proportion of concentrate, led to reduced voluntary intake, milk yield, and food efficiency due to the lower utilization of the nutrients. Diets based on corn silage in general allow a higher proportion of roughage in the diet due to energy density.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32107/24592,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Tannin extract of Acacia mearnsii for lactating ewes,"Condensed tannins can reduce protein degradation in the rumen by increasing the duodenal flow of metabolizable proteins and consequently improving animal performance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the tannin extract of Acacia mearnsii on lactating ewes receiving a total mixed ration (TMR) containing two concentrations of crude protein. The experimental treatments consisted of a TMR containing 16.4% or 22.3% of crude protein in dry matter either with or without the tannin extract of Acacia mearnsii at 20 g kg-1 dry matter. The extract concentration that guaranteed the daily intake of approximately 15 g of the extract per animal was determined. Eight lactating ewes of the Texel × Lacaune breed in the second third of lactation were distributed in a 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design, with four periods of 19 days, including 14 days of adaptation and 5 days of sample collection. Urinary nitrogen excretion was increased in the animals fed a diet containing a relatively higher protein concentration compared to those receiving a diet with a lower protein concentration. However, milk production and the concentration of milk solids did not vary significantly among treatments. The tannin extract of Acacia mearnsii decreased urinary nitrogen excretion, and consequently reduced the environmental impact of the production system, but did not significantly improve animal performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32101/24614,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Non-carcass components of finished feedlot steers fed with slow-release or agricultural urea in substitution of soybean meal,"The effect of termination of steers in a feedlot using the total substitution of soybean meal by slow-release or agriculture urea on the non-carcass components was evaluated. Twenty-seven purebred and Charolais × Nellore castrated crossbred steers (mean age 20 months, mean initial weight 293 kg) were allocated to received concentrates containing slow degradation urea, soybean meal, or agricultural urea. The experimental design was in randomized blocks (breed predominance), with three treatments and nine replicates, with the animal being the experimental unit. Diets did not lead to significant differences in empty body weight (EBW). The similarity between treatments was also verified in relation to EBW/slaughter weight, with mean values of 0.87 for treatments containing urea and 0.88 for soybean meal treatment. The gastrointestinal contents, both in absolute weight and in relation to EBW, were similar between the rations evaluated, with mean values of 54.33 kg and 13.52%, respectively. Steers fed with slow-release urea had a 32.8% higher weight of omasum relative to 100 kg of EBW (P < 0.05) compared to the animals fed with soybean meal.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32164/24593,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Sire breed effect on carcass and temperament traits,"This paper aimed to identify and evaluate the effects of sire breed on temperament and productive traits of different cross-breeds between Nellore (NE), Tabapua (TB), and Brahman (BR) bulls mated with Angus cows (AN), as well as the relationship between temperament and productive traits. The productive traits measured in this study include slaughter weight and post weaning weight gain. Temperament was assessed by flight-speed (FS). Carcass data collected in this study include hot carcass weight, hot carcass percentage, cold dressing percentage, carcass length, initial pH, ultimate pH, subcutaneous fat thickness and carcass longissimus muscle area. The sire breed effect was greater for slaughter weight. Hot carcass weight was not affected by the sire breed. The longissimus muscle area was larger for AN x TB and AN x NE crossbreeds than for AN x BR crossbreeds. Subcutaneous fat thickness and cold dressing percentage were not affected by sire breed. The offspring of NE, TB, and BR sires mated with AN cows had similar carcass measurements, except for the longissimus muscle area, which was smaller for offspring sired by the Brahman breed. The temperament trait was not influenced by sire breed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32086/24589,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Carcass characteristics and non-carcass components of young ½ Purunã x ½ Canchim bulls fed rations with three concentrate contents,"Improving the quality and energy content of rations increases performance in feedlot cattle, resulting in higher weight at slaughter, better carcass quality and a higher yield of non-carcass components. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing concentrate content in the ration on the carcass traits and weight of non-carcass components of young bulls finished in a feedlot. Eighteen young crossbred ½ Purunã x ½ Canchim bulls were used, with an average body weight (BW) of 278 kg and 12 months of age at the start of the experiment. The experimental design was completely randomized with three treatments and six replicates, where the treatments were the contents of 0.71, 0.97 and 1.24% BW day-1 of concentrate in the ration, on a dry matter (DM) basis. Corn silage was used as roughage and was provided ad libitum during the experiment. The young bulls were kept in the feedlot for 168 days and slaughtered at 17 months of age. There was a linear effect of concentrate content on the slaughter weight (SW) and hot carcass weight (HCW), which increased from 433 to 485 kg and from 248 to 280 kg between 0.71 and 1.24% BW in DM day-1 of concentrate. This represented an increase of 9.87 kg in SW and 6.16 kg in HCW for each 0.10% BW in DM day-1 of concentrate added to the ration. The hot carcass yield, rib eye area, subcutaneous fat thickness and the proportions of bone, muscle and fat in the carcass were not affected by the concentrate content and showed mean values of 57.3%, 79.6 cm2, 3.20 mm, 14.88%, 65.21% and 20.67%, respectively. There was a linear effect of concentrate content on the carcass temperature after cooling, which increased from 8.1 to 9.0 oC between 0.71 and 1.24% BW in DM day-1 of concentrate. An increase of 0.16 oC in the post-cooling carcass temperature for each 0.10% BW in DM day-1 of concentrate added to the ration was observed. The weight of internal organs and the perirenal and internal fat deposition were not affected by the concentrate content. The inclusion of 1.24% BW in DM day-1 of concentrate in the ration is recommended to obtain high SW and high HCW. Below this level, the carcass tissue composition and weight of non-carcass components are not modified.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32096/24590,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Ingestive behavior of feedlot-finished steers submitted to energy supply patterns,"This study aimed to verify the effects of supplying different energy patterns on ingestive behavior of feedlot-finished cattle. Twenty-seven pure and crossbred Charolais or Nellore steers with an initial average age and weight of 22 months and 252.8 kg, respectively, were used. Three treatments were carried out, two of them with an increasing rate of concentrate in the diet during the finishing period (IT5 and IT10) and one with constant roughage to concentrate ratio (CT). The experimental design was a completely randomized design with three treatments, five periods, and nine replications. Feeding time was higher for CT (4.31 hours) when compared to IT5 (3.85 hours). Steers from the treatment IT10 remained longer in lying leisure (8.14 hours) when compared to the treatment CT (7.24 hours). A superiority of chewing per ruminated bolus was observed in IT10 (58.59 seconds) when compared to IT5 (54.11 seconds) whereas a higher number of ruminated bolus was observed in TC5 (534.68 ruminated bolus day?1) when compared to IT10 (473.77 ruminated bolus day?1). Animals from CT presented a higher dry matter intake (9.54 kg day?1) than those from IT10 (8.63 kg day?1). Steers from CT and IT5 showed a higher NDF intake (3.63 and 3.58 kg NDF day?1, respectively) when compared to IT10 (3.29 kg NDF day?1). The constant energy pattern increases feeding time and dry matter intake. The one of less vigorous growth increases the number of bolus ruminated per day, while the one of more vigorous growth increases idle time and chews per bolus and decreases the intake of neutral detergent fiber.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32057/24588,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Corn silage supplementation for sheep eating annual ryegrass,"Food intake is determinant in the production process and can be modified when more than one type of forage is supplied in the diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with corn silage + soybean meal (9:1 based on DM) in the proportion of 10 g DM kg?1 live weight (LW) for lambs receiving pre-dried ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) in two forage supply levels: ad libitum or restricted (60% of the consumption ad libitum). Eight castrated male sheep crosses Texel × Criollo (average of 31.5 ± 2.2 kg LW) were used in an experimental design of 4 × 4 Latin square. Each experimental period was performed for 19 days, with 14 days for adaptation and 5 days for collections. Animals were fed three times a day (08h00, 11h30, and 16h30). Supplemented animals received corn silage at 08h00 and ryegrass silage at 11h30 and 16h30. The substitution rates (kg DM consumed forage per kg DM consumed silage) were 0.93 for animals with a supply of ryegrass ad libitum and zero for those receiving the same in a restricted amount. The digestible OM (DOM) intake and nitrogen retention did not vary with supplementation in animals that received ryegrass ad libitum but increased in those with restricted supply. However, animals with restricted supply and supplemented had a less digestible OM intake and nitrogen retention than the average of those that received ryegrass ad libitum. Organic matter digestibility and efficiency of microbial protein synthesis were not affected by treatments, but the digestibility of NDF and ADF was lower in supplemented animals when compared to those non-supplemented and in restricted supply when compared to consumption ad libitum. Even with supplementation, feed restriction of base forage can limit the daily intake of digestible OM and the daily retention of N in sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32001/24586,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Development and application of a sustainability assessment model for dairy production systems,"In the present study, we aimed to develop and apply a model to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of dairy production systems (DPS). In addition, we sought to analyze structural and production characteristics of DPS of different sustainability levels. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect structural and production data as well as information on sustainability actions taken by rural producers in 152 DPS located in Paraná, Brazil. The proposed model was applied to analyze the data. Each DPS received a score to represent its level of social, environmental, and economic sustainability, and DPS with similar sustainability levels were grouped according to these indicators using hierarchical cluster analysis. Three groups were formed: G1, comprising the largest proportion of DPS (63.8%); G2 comprising 20.4% of DPS; and G3, comprising 15.8% of DPS. The mean values of the sustainability indicators of each group were compared to those of other groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test. Subsequently, groups were analyzed in terms of structural and production characteristics. G2 was characterized by the highest levels of environmental, social, and economic sustainability. G1 had intermediate sustainability levels, and G3 achieved the worst results in the three sustainability indicators. The best sustainability performance of the three DPS groups was in the environmental dimension, followed by the economic dimension and lastly the social dimension. DPS with large-scale production and high productivity showed the highest sustainability indicators. The sustainability assessment model was suitable for DPS, having the advantages of being easy to apply, easy to interpret, and low cost.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32005/24587,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Method to generate growth and degrowth models obtained from differential equations applied to agrarian sciences,"This study aims to propose a method to generate growth and degrowth models using differential equations as well as to present a model based on the method proposed, compare it with the classic linear mathematical models Logistic, Von Bertalanffy, Brody, Gompertz, and Richards, and identify the one that best represents the mean growth curve. To that end, data on Undefined Breed (UB) goats and Santa Inês sheep from the works of Cavalcante et al. (2013) and Sarmento et al. (2006a), respectively, were used. Goodness-of-fit was measured using residual mean squares (RMS), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and adjusted coefficient of determination . The models’ parameters (?, weight at adulthood; ?, an integration constant; ?, shape parameter with no biological interpretation; k, maturation rate; and m, inflection point) were estimated by the least squares method using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the software IBM SPSS Statistics 1.0. It was observed that the proposed model was superior to the others to study the growth curves of goats and sheep according to the methodology and conditions under which the present study was carried out.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31704/24609,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Performance, carcass traits, and non-carcass components of feedlot finished lambs from different residual feed intake classes","This study aimed to assess the performance, carcass traits, and non-carcass components of feedlot finished Texel crossbred lambs from different residual feed intake classes (RFI). Forty-seven uncastrated male Texel crossbred lambs (¾ Texel + ¼ Pantaneira) tested here were 4-month-old with an initial weight of 29.9 ± 5.5 kg. The lambs were confined for 70 days for individual dry matter intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) assessment. The diet containing corn silage was provided as roughage, while the concentrate consisted of corn grain, soybean meal, urea, and mineral mixture with a 40:60 roughage to concentrate ratio and 76.34% total digestible nutrients (TDN). After confinement for 70 days, the lambs were slaughtered to assess carcass traits and non-carcass components. Based on the RFI, lambs were divided into three classes according to the standard deviation (sd): Positive RFI (inefficient, 0.5 above the mean), Negative RFI (efficient, 0.5 below the mean), and Medium RFI (intermediate). Classes with Negative (efficient) and Positive RFI (inefficient) showed no differences in ADG (0.321 vs 0.306 kg; P > 0.05). Dry matter intake (g d-1), and percentage of body weight (BW) differed significantly between the RFI classes (P < 0.05). Compared to lambs in the inefficient class, those in the efficient class (Negative RFI) showed a 9% reduction in DMI and had the same ADG. The lambs in either Positive or Negative RFI classes showed no weight differences between non-carcass components (P > 0.05). The RFI classes showed no differences in shrunk body weight, hot carcass weight, hot dressing, and weight of commercial cuts (P > 0.05). They showed no differences in neck, shoulder + shank, loin, rack, flank steak, rack cap off, and leg weights (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that improvement in feed efficiency, as a function of the RFI index, does not compromise performance and carcass traits of Texel crossbred lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31642/24584,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Growth, productive performance, and udder health of crossbred Holstein x Simmental cows and purebred Holstein cows","The crossbreeding between dairy cow breeds has been used as an alternative to improve some characteristics such as milk composition, udder health, and reproductive aspects on dairy herds. The aim was to compare growth, milk yield and composition, and mammary gland health of crossbred Holstein x Simmental and purebred Holstein cows. Data were gathered from a farm located in Santa Catarina state, south of Brazil. Cow growth was assessed by weighing calves and heifers monthly. Yet for milk yield and udder health, data were taken from records of the official Dairy Herd Improvement Program carried out in the evaluated farm. These data were subjected to variance analysis using the MIXED procedure of SAS statistical software. Non-linear regressions were used to adjust the data to the growth curves. The crossbred Holstein x Simmental cows produced more milk than did purebreds (31.8 kg/day vs. 30.4 kg/day; p < 0.05), with higher contents of lactose (4.63% vs. 4.53%) and protein (3.14% vs. 3.03%), but no differences in fat content (3.00 vs. 2.96). Purebred cows had higher somatic cell score (SCS) 4.49 vs. 2.93 (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, no differences were found for the growth of calves and heifers. In conclusion, crossbred Holstein x Simmental cows have higher energy corrected milk as the Holstein ones, whit greater uncorrected milk yield only for cows with three or more lactations. Crossbreeds cows produce milk with better quality, indicated by lower SCS and higher solids content, besides showing a lower SCS and no differences regarding weight gain of calves and heifers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31216/24580,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Carcass characteristics and tissue composition of the meat of feedlot lambs fed high-grain diets,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of using different high-grain diets on the carcass characteristics and tissue composition of the meat of feedlot-finished lambs. Thirty-two male castrated Texel lambs born from single births and weaned at approximately 50 days of age were allotted to treatments that consisted of different unprocessed grains, as follows: corn grain, white oat grain, black oat grain, or grain of rice in the husk. The animals were slaughtered upon reaching the pre-established slaughter weight of 32 kg, which corresponds to 60% of the mature weight of their mothers. Lambs fed the high-corn grain diet had higher weights and yields of hot and cold carcass and larger loin-eye areas than those finished in the feedlot receiving high-grain diets based on white oat, black oat, or rice in the husk. Additionally, they had a higher degree of fatness and a thicker subcutaneous fat layer at slaughter, which lead to decreased cooler shrink loss. The neck, shoulder, ribs, and leg cuts were heavier in lambs fed the high-corn grain diet. By contrast, these lambs had a lower proportion of leg, more rib, and higher meat fat content, which may be undesirable for the consumer market. The use of high-corn grain diets, in comparison with high-grain diets based on black oat, white oat, and rice in the husk, may be recommended for finishing lambs in the feedlot when they are slaughtered at similar weights.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31607/24583,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Concentrate containing calcium salts of fatty acids rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids can change rumen fermentation in grazing goats,"Feeding goats with calcium salts of fatty acids (CSFA) can supply ruminants with lipids, with minimal effects on ruminal fermentation and fiber digestibility. However, there is a shortage of information on the effect of CSFA on characteristics of rumen fermentation in grassland goats. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the addition of CSFA to concentrate on the parameters of rumen fermentation of grazing goats. Five rumen cannulated goats were distributed in a Latin square 5x5 design (treatments: 0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5% and 6.0% CSFA. The pH, ammonia N and volatile fatty acids (VFA) content were analyzed in the ruminal fluid at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after concentrate supplementation. The pH and ammonia N concentration showed a linear effect with the addition of CSFA. There was no effect observed for the VFA molar concentration after grazing goats were fed with the experimental diet. In conclusion, further research is needed to investigate the addition of CSFA to goat diets because there is evidence that CSFA increases ruminal pH and decreases excess ruminal ammonia without changing the VFA concentration in the rumen fluid.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31391/24582,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Fatty acid composition of milk from Holstein x Gyr cows grazing on marandu grass supplemented with concentrate containing sunflower oil,"The inclusion of plant oils in the diets of grazing cows represents a promising nutritional strategy for the production of milk naturally enriched with bioactive compounds, such as rumenic (cis-9, trans-11 CLA), vaccenic (trans-11 C18:1) and oleic (cis-9 C18:1) acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with sunflower oil (SO) on the fatty acid (FA) composition of milk from Holstein x Gyr dairy cows grazing on Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu under rotational stocking. Sixteen multiparous cows with 185±10 days in milk received a concentrate containing 0% (control) or 15% SO on a dry matter basis in a randomized block design with two replications (paddocks). The results were analyzed with mixed models (P ? 0.05) using repeated measurements over time, as represented by sampling days 14, 35 and 62 (periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively). In any period, an effect of SO supplementation was observed on milk production, pasture dry matter intake and nutrients intake, whereas the concentrations of most milk FA were altered in SO-fed cows. In particular, dietary supplementation with SO resulted in the production of milk enriched with FA beneficial to human health (rumenic, vaccenic and oleic acids) and with lower levels of hypercholesterolemic lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0) and palmitic (C16:0) acids. This positive effect on the nutritional quality of milk fat was more noticeable from the 40th to 43rd days of sunflower oil supplementation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31206/24579,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Performance and ingestive and social behavior of young cattle with different sexual conditions supplemented in Aruana pasture,"This study was conducted aiming at measuring the performance and behavior of beef cattle surgically castrated, immunocastrated or non-castrated, finished at 18 months old in Aruana pasture and with energy supplementation. Thirty-nine male bovines with an initial average body weight and age of 284.1 ± 31.4 kg and 14 months old, respectively, were used. The bromatological composition analysis and productive parameters of the pasture did not differ between treatments. The performance of young cattle was not changed by the sexual condition. When evaluating the agonistic behavior, the non-castrated bovine presented a higher number of activities, such as threats and fights, in relation to those immunocastrated. The time spent on the feeder by non-castrated young cattle (56.20 minutes) was higher than that observed for surgically castrated or immunocastrated (41.43 and 32.38 minutes, respectively). The combination between the correct management of Aruana pasture and use of supplementation showed to be promising for finishing bovines. Both surgically castrated and immunocastrated steers demonstrated to be equivalents in the performed evaluations. Therefore, if the farmer chooses castration, the use of immunocastration is suggested. This practice is less invasive, preserves animal welfare more than surgical castration, and has a lower cost.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31105/24610,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of frequency of protein-energetic supplementation on the performance and ingestive behavior of Nellore calves kept in a tropical pasture in the dry season,"With the objective to evaluate different frequencies of supplementation on the performance and ingestive behavior of Nellore calves kept on Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu pasture, 56 animals with initial average body weight (BW) of 174.5 kg were submitted to the following treatments: no supplement and 1x, 3x, and 7x supplementation per week. The supplement was provided in the amount of 3.5 g kg-1 of BW day-1. BW and evaluation of behavior were assessed every 28 days. The randomized block's design with two repetitions was used. The analyses of variance were carried out by the GLM procedure in the SAS software, and the means were compared by the Tukey’s test at 5% significance. The supplementation increased the average daily gain (ADG; P ? 0.05); however, it did not differ between frequencies (0.005, 0.190, 0.183, and 0.177 kg head-1 day for the no supplement treatment and 1x, 3x, and 7x per week, respectively). The animals in the no supplement treatment showed longer grazing time (P ? 0.05) compared to those receiving the supplement. However, results did not differ between frequencies (10.44, 8.57, 8.32, and 8.59 hours day-1 for no supplement treatments and 1x, 3x, and 7x per week, respectively). Thus, the frequency of supplementation can be reduced to once a week without reducing animal performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30644/24577,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Kaolin and chromic oxide under different forms of administration in a study of consumption and digestibility,"Animal nutrition needs simple methodologies to be applied under field conditions, providing valid estimates of consumption and digestibility that can be used by both farmers and animal input industry. Thus, the search for new substances, provided in a practical way, quantified by simple and low-cost analytical methodologies, replacing external indicators (chromic oxide used as reference) would be well accepted by the scientific community. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the supply of chorionic oxide by esophageal route or mixed in the diet and the use of kaolin as an indicator, under the same forms of administration, to estimate fecal production and digestibility using four castrated male Holstein cattle. The experimental design was a 4 × 4 Latin square design, with four experimental periods of 12 days and six-day intervals between periods. Treatments consisted of supplying chromic oxide by esophageal route (COer), kaolin by esophageal route (Kaoer), chromic oxide mixed to the diet (COdiet), and kaolin mixed to the diet (Kaodiet). The treatment Kaodiet allowed obtaining estimates of fecal production similar to the treatment COer. The treatment COdiet did not differ from the treatment COer (p > 0.05) considering all the assessed parameters, evidencing that the indicator chromic oxide can be supplied mixed directly in the diet without damaging the estimates of fecal production and digestibility. Under the studied conditions, kaolin was not an effective indicator to obtain accurate estimates of fecal production and further studies are needed to adjust the analytical techniques of aluminum extraction as well as to resolve some doubts regarding its digestion process.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31341/24581,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Bionutritional efficiency and carcass characteristics of confined steers receiving different nitrogen sources with whole or milled corn,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the bionutritional efficiency and carcass characteristics of confined steers receiving different nitrogen sources associated or not with corn grain processing in the diet. The study used a completely randomized design with a 3?? 2 factorial arrangement. Fifty-three Charolais and Nellore crossbred steers were used, with a mean age of 22 ± 0.23 months and initial weight 250 ± 15.80 kg. The animals were randomly divided into the following treatments: soybean meal + whole corn, soybean meal + milled corn, conventional urea + whole corn, conventional urea + milled corn, slow-release urea + whole corn, and slow-release urea + milled corn. A roughage: concentrate ratio of 50: 50 was used. The steers were confined until reaching a weight of 420 kg. The slaughtering occurred according to the schedule of the commercial slaughterhouse. Feed efficiency was lower in animals receiving slow-release urea than those fed true protein. The steers fed soybean meal presented a higher Kleiber ratio and higher nutritional index compared to those receiving conventional or slow-release urea. The provision of soybean meal promoted higher production of rib meat and meat with a higher L* compared to those receiving urea, and better carcass finish compared to those receiving slow-release urea. Diets with milled corn increased warm and cold carcass yields and decreased weight loss during carcass chilling. Total replacement of soybean meal with conventional or slow-release urea reduced the biological efficiency of steers. The supply of milled corn in the concentrated fraction increased carcass yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30628/24576,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Immunocastration and its effects on carcass and meat traits of male pigs,"To compose the experiment, 160 male Topgen pigs - 80 surgically castrated (treatment 1) and 80 immunocastrated (treatment 2) - were randomly selected from a commercial swine farm at the moment of slaughter. Surgical castration was performed when the animals were seven days of age and immunocastration was performed by administering two doses (2 mL each) of immunocastration vaccine (analogue of GnRF linked to a carrier protein, development of anti-GnRF antibodies, 200 mg of a GnRF-protein conjugate/mL) when they were 104 and 132 days of age. Animals from both treatments were maintained in masonry stalls, where they received water and ad libitum diet (the same feed for both groups). The animals were slaughtered at 160 days of age, and the length and width of the testicles of immunocastrated animals were evaluated, along with the degree and number of carcass lesions, carcass traits and meat quality of both treatments. The means of these measurements were calculated and compared by Student´s t-test. For the immunocastrated treatment, Pearson´s correlation coefficients were also calculated for testicle length and width with backfat thickness. Approximately 80% of the immunocastrated animals had testicle widths of 11 cm or less. Immunocastrated animals showed higher degrees of lesions, pH (initial and 8 hours), hue, muscle depth and loin eye area and lower brightness, redness, chroma and backfat thickness than the surgically castrated animals. The correlation between testicle length and width with backfat thickness was inverse. Immunocastration can be an alternative to improve the proportion of lean meat (longissimus thoracis) instead of fat (backfat thickness) leading to better carcass and meat quality, since fat has become undesirable from a nutritional point of view in swine.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30216/24573,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Productivity and nutritional value of tropical grasses in monoculture and intercropping with interseason corn,"This study aimed to assess productivity and nutritional value of the tropical grasses Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã, Xaraés, and Marandu, Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça, and B. ruziziensis cv. Kennedy in the interseason of an integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system since alternatives are needed for forage production for animal grazing in Autumn and Winter. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a split-split plot scheme with four replications. The treatments of plots consisted of five grasses, subplots consisted of three cropping systems (monoculture, intercropping with corn and unsuppressed grass, and intercropped with corn and suppressed grass), and sub-subplots consisted of four cutting intervals of grasses (50, 90, 125, and 195 days after emergence - DAE). The experiment was carried out from February to September 2014. Dry matter (DM) productivity, obtained at 195 DAE for the three cropping systems (monoculture grass, unsuppressed and suppressed grass in intercropping), were 18.45, 7.15, and 3.05 t ha?1, respectively, and average crude protein contents of leaf blades of grasses decreased linearly between the cutting intervals of 50 to 195 DAE from 19.95 to 9.70%, respectively. Under integrated systems, the studied grasses showed better yields and nutritional quality when compared to traditional grazing systems. Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés and Piatã had the highest leaf and crude protein yields when compared to Brachiaria ruziziensis cv. Kennedy and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. In terms of nutritional value, Brachiaria ruziziensis cv. Kennedy was superior to Mombaça and Xaraés grasses but had lower total dry matter yield. Finally, Xaraés, Piatã and Mombaça grasses are recommended choices ICL systems when fodder grass production is the goal.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27435/24572,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Occurrence and risk factors for Toxoplasma gondii infection in goats from micro-regions of the state of Piauí,"This study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Toxoplasma gondii infection in goats from micro-regions of the state of Piauí (Brazil). From six randomly selected properties, 145 goats were examined. Serum samples of the animals were analyzed by ELISA for the presence or absence of antibodies against T. gondii. Of these, 22% were seroreactive for T. gondii. Individual records were also taken for each property. These analyses showed that factors such as sex, age, water source, and presence of cats were associated with animal seropositivity. In addition, there was also a positive correlation (p > 0.04) between animal sex and T. gondii contamination. The presence of cats in the facilities and animal pasture fields appeared to be a risk factor for the contamination of goats in the assessed properties (p > 0.03). The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is present in the goat herds of southern Piauí state, and females are more likely to be contaminated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32045/24613,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Dynamics of hematological parameters in female lambs during the first four months of life,"Important physiological changes affect the blood profile of ruminants during the growth phase, but few studies approach the factors involved in these dynamics in lambs. The aim of this study was to characterize the dynamics of hematological parameters, of total plasma protein (TPP), and of fibrinogen in healthy female lambs during the first four months of life. Blood samples of 35 female lambs were collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days old to perform the complete blood count (CBC). The erythrocyte and leukocyte parameters, TPP, and fibrinogen were determined. The means for total red blood cell (RBC) counts at 60 and 120 days differed (P < 0.05) from the initial mean, showing a peak of 13.6 x 106 cells µL-1 at 60 days old. The mean values for packed cell volume (PCV) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration increased (P < 0.05) until 90 days and decreased at 120 days (36.6% to 33.7% and 11.4 g dL-1 to 10.6 g dL-1 between 90 and 120 days, respectively). The means for mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) increased (P < 0.05) between 30 and 120 days (27.5 µm3 to 29.7 µm3 and 26.6% to 31.4%, respectively). The total white blood cell (WBC) count increased (P < 0.05) and reached a peak at 90 days (9,314 cells µL-1). The peaks for segmented neutrophils (5,141 cells µL-1) and lymphocyte counts (4,236 cells µL-1) occurred at 60 and 90 days, respectively. The means for neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were similar (P > 0.05) between the ages (mean of 1.8) but higher than the reference value for adult sheep (0.5). The initial mean for eosinophil counts (2 cells µL-1) was lower (P < 0.05) than all subsequent ones, and the monocyte count showed the lowest level (P < 0.05) at 120 days (232 cells µL-1). The mean for TPP at 60 days (6.4 g dL-1) was higher (P < 0.05) than the other ages. Except for band neutrophil and basophil counts, and fibrinogen concentration, the hematological parameters and the TPP of female lambs are influenced by age until four months of life and differ from the reference intervals established for adult sheep. Therefore, the interpretation of CBCs performed in female lambs should be made on the basis of age group-specific reference intervals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32179/24567,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Occurrence of Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis and Tritrichomonas foetus dna in bulls from Alagoas State, Brazil","The aim of the present study is to diagnose the occurrence of infections caused by Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis and Tritrichomonas foetus in reproducer bulls from Alagoas State breeders, Brazil. The total of 162 preputial smegma samples were collected from nelore bulls from ten rural properties in the East, Agreste and Sertão mesoregions. The samples were subjected to the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique in order to assess C. fetus subsp. venerealis and Tritrichomonas foetus DNA and cultivated in Modified Diamond Medium (DMM) for Tritrichomonas foetus isolation. Four point nine percent (4.9% - 8/162) of the evaluated bulls were infected with C. fetus subsp. venerealis and 3.0% (5/162) of the sample were infected with T. foetus, which was not isolated in any of the assessed animals. Based on our results, there was C. fetus subsp. venerealis and T. foetus DNA in bulls from Alagoas State, Brazil.

39,2018,Occurrence of antibodies against Neospora caninum in cattle and dogs from dairy farms from the central northern region of Paraná State,"Neosporosis is one of the principal causes of reproductive problems in cattle worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of anti-Neospora caninum antibodies in cattle and dogs from dairy farms from the central northern region of Paraná state. Blood samples with and without EDTA were collected from 400 cattle and 46 dogs from 20 properties. Nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) was performed on whole blood samples and indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IFR) on the serum samples (after clot retraction). Cattle and dogs with titers ? 100 and ? 50, respectively, were considered positive. Anti-N. caninum was detected in 20,1% (80/400) of cattle, with titers ranging from 100 to 1600. The n-PCR presented only two cattle positives (0.5%). Anti-N. caninum was detected in 19,6% (9/46) of the dogs, with titers ranging from 50 to 6400. The occurrence of antibodies against N. caninum obtained in the present study was similar to those in studies performed in other regions of Paraná and Brazil.

39,2018,Association of abortion history with the presence of anti-Neospora caninum antibodies in dairy cows,"Neospora caninum is an important cause of abortions in dairy cattle, leading to severe economic losses. The objective of this study was to determine the association of serum antibodies against N. caninum with a history of abortion in dairy cows. A total of 46 dairy cows from nine dairy farms were evaluated; 28 with a history of one or more abortions and 18 without a history of abortions. Antibodies against N. caninum were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, and the reaction was considered positive when the titer was ?1:50. Serum antibodies against N. caninum were detected in 39.1% (18/46) of all cows, 57.1% (16/28) of cows with a history of abortion, and 11.1% (2/18) of cows without a history of abortion. Among the seropositive cows, 88.9% had a history of abortion. All farms showed at least one animal positive for N. caninum. These results indicate an association between seropositivity for N. caninum and a history of abortion in cows. Cows with a history of abortion were 10.6 times more likely to be seropositive for N. caninum than cows without a history of abortion. Therefore, we concluded that there is an association between a history of abortion and the presence of antibodies against N. caninum in dairy cows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31800/24612,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Quality of goat's milk produced on farms in the Paraná State - Brazil,"The consumption of goat's milk has increased significantly in Brazil. In 2014, its production was 153 thousand tons, and the Paraná state is responsible for the production of 380 thousand liters. Although the government regulates goat milk, this raw material is not widely studied in Brazil. The objective of this work was to study its microbiological and physicochemical characteristics. A total of 32 samples from 8 Paraná State farms were analyzed. The microbial indicators of hygiene, psychrotrophic bacteria, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were evaluated. We used physicochemical tests of goat’s milk that were established by the Brazilian legislation. In addition, phosphatase activity, pH, conductivity, boiling test, and urea content were measured. The average concentrations of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, E. coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus and psychrotrophic microorganisms were 4.10, 2.38, 0.65, 2.06 and 4.02 log CFU mL-1, respectively. The samples did not present L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. In the physicochemical analysis, 90.63% of the samples presented at least one parameter outside the legal standards. In the somatic cell count, 73.33% of the samples had counts higher than 1 x 106 cells mL-1. Raw goat's milk produced in Paraná has high coliform and psychrotrophic counts, indicating poor hygiene during milking. The fluctuating values of the physicochemical data indicate that additional studies are required to determine the parameters that reflect the Brazilian conditions of goat milk production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31495/24562,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Reaction of plant species to Meloidogyne enterolobii and the efficiency of their aqueous extracts in controlling the pathogen,"The genus Meloidogyne includes species of the most common nematodes to affect crops around the world. The species M. enterolobii is notable for affecting and causing serious losses in the production of guava trees and various other economically important crops in Brazil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of 10 plant species to parasitism by M. enterolobii, and the in vitro and in vivo effects of their leaf extracts on the pathogen. Initially seedlings of Solenostemon scutellarioides, Dieffenbachia amoena, Spigelia anthelmia, Plumbago scandens, Ricinus communis, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Azadirachta indica, Morinda citrifolia, Jatropha curcas and Datura stramonium were inoculated with 5,000 eggs of M. enterolobii to evaluate their susceptibility to nematode infection. For the test in vitro, a 5% concentration of the leaf extracts were added to Petri dishes, and 50 J2 of M. enterolobii were placed in each dish. After 48 hours incubation, the juveniles were evaluated for motility and mortality in the extracts. For the test in vivo, leaf extracts were used at the same concentration, however with only the seven most-promising in vitro species. This assay included the following sequence: inoculation of 5,000 eggs in autoclaved and moist soil contained in 1L pots; application of 30 ml of extract to the soil after 24 hours; transplanting of ‘Santa Clara’ tomato seedlings the following day; and reapplying the extract after 7 and 14 days. The results were evaluated 45 days after nematode inoculation. It was seen that the species D. amoena, R. communis, A. indica, M. citrifolia, J. curcas and D. stramonium displayed highly resistant behaviour; S. anthelmia, P. scandens and C. ambrosioides were very resistant, whereas S. scutelarioides was susceptible to the nematode. With the in vitro test, extracts from seven of the 10 species caused 70.4% to 97.4% J2 mortality. Applying the best leaf extracts to the soil was efficient in reducing M. enterolobii infestation in roots of the tomato.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31619/24559,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Application of green banana flour for partial substitution of wheat flour in sliced bread,"The objective of this work was to develop a sliced bread product with green banana flour in order to obtain high resistant starch content and good acceptance. Four bread formulations were studied, at concentrations of 0% (control), 15%, 20% and 25% green banana flour (Terra Maranhão variety). The green banana flour (GBF) was characterized as to color (L * coordinate and C * and h * parameters), and flour and bread were characterized with respect to chemical composition and total and resistant starch contents. Sensory acceptance of breads was investigated for the attributes color, flavor, aroma, texture, overall acceptance and purchase intention. The GBF presented light yellow color, with values of L * = 81.32, C * = 18.37 and h * = 89.51. The values (d. b.) for the other characteristics were: yield, 25.17%; moisture, 6.69%; ash, 1.60%; protein, 2.66%; lipids, 0.61%; total starch, 67.49%; and resistant starch, 56.29%. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the breads containing GBF, and the sliced breads showed lower protein value (8.64%) than the control (10.60%) and higher resistant starch content (2.91%) compared to the control (0.65%). Addition of GBF to bread did not interfere with the moisture, ash and lipid contents of the products. Breads with concentrations of 15 and 20% GBF received acceptance higher than 90% for all sensory attributes. The use of GBF in sliced bread at the 15% and 20% levels resulted in a product with high sensory acceptance (greater than 90%) and with resistant starch content 4.2 times higher than conventional sliced bread.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32673/24611,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Growth-promoting bacteria change the development of aerial part and root system of canola,"Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are soil bacteria that have the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and favor the growth of plants through several mechanisms, such as phytohormone production, biological fixation in nitrogen (BNF), increased efficiency in uptake of nutrients in the soil, and greater tolerance to water stress or disease attack. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of inoculation of different growth promoting bacteria on the development of canola plants. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with a completely randomized design. Four treatments were evaluated: control - without inoculation, Azospirillum brasilense of strain Ab-V5, Rhizobium sp. strain 8121, and Bacillus sp. strain CM. The height parameter of plants was evaluated weekly, starting at 25 days after sowing (DAS). At the end of the evaluations, at 53 DAS, the length of the main root, the dry mass of the aerial part and the root system were measured. The canola showed a linear increase in height from 25 to 53 DAS. Bacillus sp. negatively influenced the growth of the plants, reducing their height in periods 25, 32 and 39 DAS in relation to the control group. A. brazilense. yielded 2.64 times more dry root mass (0.7 g plant-1) than the control plants (0.3 g plant-1). Even though Rhizobium sp. produced an increase in the length of the main root, this was not reflected in an increment of dry mass in the root system. The greatest development of the root system was provided by A. brazilense.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31798/24558,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the genetic divergence between native jaboticaba trees, based on physico-chemical characters, as a complementary tool to identify superior genotypes for selection as future cultivar or male parent. To this end, 15 variables were analyzed, linked to physical-chemical and biochemical characteristics of fruits that were harvested in two productive cycles. As a pre-selection, it was adopted the choose of 20% better genotypes that showed the highest frequency of superiority in evaluated characteristics and through genetic divergence select potential parents with their respective subsidiaries hybridizations. The characteristic that has contributed most to the genetic divergence was the equatorial diameter, explaining much of the total variation, thus being the most important component. There were differences among the populations grouped by Tocher method with those obtained with the dendrogram the nearest neighbor clustering method in relation to jaboticabeira plant groups. There was genetic variability among the analyzed jabuticabeira trees, and thus, it is recommended performing hybridization between genotypes 79 with 119 and 96 with 148.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32892/24561,E-ISSN 1679-0359

(cajuzinho-do-cerrado) achenes,"The cajuzinho-do-cerrado is a native species of the cerrado of great potential of use and is threatened of extinction. The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate the thermodynamic properties of Anacardium humile St. Hil. achenes from the different hygroscopic equilibrium points according to the moisture content. To obtain the isotherms, the indirect static method was used at temperatures of 10, 20, 30 and 40 °C and for moisture contents of 13.4, 11.1, 8.7 and 5.3% dry basis (db). The Copace model was used to describe the hygroscopic equilibrium of the achenes. The thermodynamic properties are influenced by the moisture content because the latent heat of vaporization of the water of the achenes increases with the decrease in the equilibrium moisture content, varying between 3,035.63 and 2,510.80 kJ kg-1 for moisture contents of 4.51 to 13.4% db, respectively. The differential enthalpy and entropy are closely related to the moisture content of the achenes. The isokinetic temperature of 304.67 K denotes the linear chemical compensation between the differential enthalpy and entropy of the Anacardium humile St. Hil. achenes, and the desorption process is controlled by enthalpy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30482/24556,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Assessing impact of climate change on the wheat production in the Yellow River Basin, China","Conflicts between water supply and water demand are intensifying in irrigation districts along the Lower Yellow River, China, due to climate change and human activities. To ensure both adequate food supply and water resource sustainability in the region, this paper investigated the relationship between wheat yield and meteorological variables in 7 provinces within the Yellow River Basin. The key meteorological variables that influenced wheat yield were identified, and the regression functions between climate relevant wheat yield and these variables were established. Combining with the climate change scenarios in the future, the impact of climate change on crop yield were assessed. To cope with limited water resources in this region, it is necessary to properly irrigate crops based on soil water content and take full advantage of precipitation and surface runoff during the summer maize season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31633/24557,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Influence of seed vernalization on production, growth and development of lisianthus","Flowering induction and control is a limiting factor when commercially producing cut flowers of lisianthus and seed exposure to low temperatures, a physiological event called vernalization, induces the differentiation of vegetative buds to reproductive buds, contributing to a flowering that is uniform and has quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of seed vernalization in three cultivars of lisianthus (Excalibur, Echo and Mariachi) for 12, 24, 36 and 48 days at temperatures of 5, 10 and 15°C, in the production and quality of buds, making this technology feasible to large-scale production. During cultivation it was observed that the lower the temperature and higher the vernalization period, the lower the cycle and the greater the number of plants induced to flowering for all three cultivars, and those are important features in the context of flower production in a commercial scale. The seeds subjected to vernalization originated plants that produce flower stems within the standards required by the market, showing that vernalization was efficient to induce flowering without affecting the quality of the buds. To produce lisianthus as a cut flower of quality, it is recommended seed vernalization of Mariachi and Echo cultivars for 24 days at 5°C and Excalibur for 36 days at 5°C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29718/24554,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Minimum temperature differences between the meteorological screen and grass in radiative frost nights,"A phenomenon called thermal inversion, in which there is the accumulation of colder and denser air in the layers closer to the soil, occurs in radiative frost nights, resulting in a temperature gradient with differences between the meteorological screen and grass, which vary depending on cooling conditions. Knowing this temperature difference assists in taking preventive measures against radiative frosts, as well as in estimating the probability of their occurrences. In this context, this study aimed to verify the adjustment of different probability distributions to determine the differences between the minimum temperature measured in the meteorological screen and grass temperature below 0 °C for eight regions of the Paraná State, as well as the probability of occurring these differences and adjust estimation equations of grass temperature from minimum air temperature. Temperature differences between the screen and grass were calculated and probability distributions of their occurrences were adjusted in order to determine risks per intervals of temperature differences. Estimation equations of grass temperature were adjusted from minimum screen temperatures. Average gradients of minimum temperature were observed between the screen and grass ranging from 4.2 to 6.3 °C in the analyzed regions. The average temperature difference measured in the meteorological screen and grass for the Paraná State was 5 °C. The probabilistic model of normal distribution is the most suitable for determining the probability of occurring the differences between the screen and grass temperatures for the Paraná State. Regional relief and climate conditions influence the magnitude of the minimum temperature gradient measured in the meteorological screen and grass. Estimation equations can be useful to determine the grass temperature based on the minimum air temperature for periods in which there is no such data and thus provide a subsidy for studies of risk analysis of frosts. The results of this analysis are empirical and the equations should be used in regions in which they were adjusted aiming at a higher accuracy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30322/24555,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Glyphosate, trinexapac-ethyl, and mepiquat chloride on the productive performance of bush snap beans","Studies aimed at improving production and yield of bush snap beans are desirable; the results may provide growers with new techniques to improve profitability. In the literature, there are few reports on the productive performance of vegetables subjected to doses of glyphosate and plant regulators. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of glyphosate, trinexapac-ethyl, and mepiquat chloride doses on the production components and yield of bush snap beans. We tested various doses: a) glyphosate: 0.0; 18.0; 36.0; 72.0; and 144.0 g acid equivalent (ae) ha-1; b) trinexapac-ethyl: 0.0; 62.5; 125.0; 250.0; and 500.0 g ae ha-1; and c) mepiquat chloride: 0.0; 25.0; 50.0; 75.0; and 100.0 g ae ha-1. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four replications per treatment. We evaluated plant height, stem diameter, number and mass of pods per plant, mass, length, and diameter of pod, and yield. The analysis of variance was conducted by applying the F test, and the doses were submitted to regression analysis (p < 0.05). Each active ingredient was considered separately. Productive performance was favored by using doses up to 16.0 g ae ha-1 of glyphosate, showing increased pod mass per plant and yield. As trinexapac-ethyl doses increased, the number of pods per plant decreased but mean pod mass increased. Doses of mepiquat chloride up to 59.5 g ae ha-1 increased mean pod mass. Finally, pod yield was not influenced by trinexapac-ethyl and mepiquat chloride.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28420/24553,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Genetic diversity of migratory fish populations of the Rio Grande Reservoir (São Paulo, Brazil)","In recent years, anthropogenic factors such as pollution, overfishing, and construction of hydroelectric plants have significantly impacted natural fish populations. Research focusing on genetically evaluation of these impacts is necessary to objectively target conservation programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of Curimba (Prochilodus lineatus), Pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus), and Piracanjuba (Brycon orbignyanus) populations from the Água Vermelha Reservoir, Rio Grande-SP. Microsatellite loci were amplified, producing 56, 24, and 26 alleles for the populations of the three species, respectively. The number of alleles per locus ranged from three to ten for P. lineatus, two to five for P. mesopotamicus, and two to four for B. orbignyanus. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) was higher in the P. lineatus population (0.547), relative to the P. mesopotamicus and B. orbignyanus populations (0.473 and 0.527, respectively). The mean values of Ho were lower than the average expected heterozygosity (He) in the three species, being corroborated by the positive inbreeding coefficient (Fis). Deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were found in five, three, and two loci for P. lineatus, P. mesopotamicus, and B. orbignyanus, respectively. Wilcoxon tests revealed recent bottlenecks in the three species, evidenced by a significant excess of heterozygotes (p < 0.05) detected only in the Infinite Allele Model (IAM). In conclusion, adequate genetic variability was observed in the three populations with the presence of heterozygous deficits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32727/25025,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium in calves from rural settlements in the Northwest region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil","The study was conducted on 25 properties of the settlements São José I and Salvador, located in the municipalities of Brejo Alegre and Birigui, in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. A record of variables was elaborated and included data such as gender, breed and age of the animals. A total of 231 stool samples were collected from bovines aged one to six months, 128 being females and 103 males, 131 crossbred and 100 Holstein. Among the 231 samples, 17 (7.36%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. both by malachite green negative staining and by nested-PCR. Of the 17 positive samples, 14 were sequenced in agarose gel. These sequences were detected between 99% and 100% of genetic similarity for the following species. One sequence was similar to C. parvum (AB513880.1), one to C. bovis (MF074602.1), two to C. ryanae (KT922233.1), one to C. felis (KM977642.1) and nine were similar for C. andersoni reference MF350628. C. andersoni was found in animals aged 2–6 months, an age group which is different from those described by several authors. The presence of C. parvum indicates that the calves in the studied region should be considered a potential source for zoonotic transmission. For the first time to our knowledge, C. felis was identified in cattle in America.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33245/25081,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Nutritional evaluation of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu cultivated in soils developed from basalt and sandstone in the state of Paraná,"Determining the nutritional composition of a pasture is necessary to evaluate its quality, aiming to meet the requirements of feeding animals and guarantee good performance. The quality of the forage biomass produced depends directly on the fertility and type of soil, environmental conditions, and management. In this scenario, the aim was to evaluate the chemical composition, in vitro digestibility of dry matter, and macro- and micronutrient contents of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu cultivated in soils developed from basalt and sandstone in the state of Paraná. A total of 120 forage samples were collected in a soil developed from basalt and 116 in soil developed from sandstone. Forage harvesting occurred in autumn and spring for basalt soil (season effect), and in spring (soil effect) for sandstone soil. Soil samples (0–20 cm) were collected in the spring season, at the same forage collection sites, to obtain a greater sample representativity regarding climate–soil–plant relationships. Forage samples were separated in leaf blade and stem + sheath, and analyses of dry matter (DM), mineral matter (MM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), total digestible nutrients (TDN), nitrogen, and macro- and micronutrient contents were performed. In soil samples, the contents of P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn were analyzed. There were season and soil-type effects on the chemical composition of the cultivar studied. The highest levels of protein, NDF, ADF, lignin, and cellulose were obtained in autumn. In samples from soil developed from basalt, higher levels of hemicellulose, IVDMD, and TDN were obtained in the spring. K, P, Mn, and Zn presented levels within the range recommended for the studied forage, but the values of Ca and Mg in autumn and N in the three studied periods remained below the level considered adequate. Soil nutrient contents were influenced (P < 0.05) by the soil source material, and the highest levels of K, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn were observed in soil developed from basalt. Forage cultivated in spring in the soil area developed from basalt, was nutritionally superior in relation to forage cultivated in the soil developed from sandstone.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33924/25021,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Evaluation of models utilized in in vitro gas production from tropical feedstuffs,"This study aimed to evaluate the adequacy of seven non-linear models (France, Orskov and McDonald, Gompertz, exponential, logistic, two-pool exponential and two-pool logistic) in the adjustment of the curve and in the generation of parameters of cumulative gas production from five tropical feedstuffs (rice hulls, sugarcane, cassava chips, turnip by-product, and peach-palm by-product) used in ruminant nutrition. To this end, the feedstuffs were incubated in vitro in graduated glass syringes together with a buffer inoculum solution, in triplicate. Gas production was read at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 48, 52, 54, 56, 60 and 72 h of incubation. The data were used to generate the parameters of each model using the SAS statistical package. After the parameters were generated, the gas volume values were obtained at the aforementioned times, for each model, and these were compared with the values observed at incubation by using Model Evaluation System (MES) software. For the comparison, regression parameters were tested using Mayer’s test, in addition to the evaluation of the mean bias (MS), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean squared prediction error (MSPE). The France, Logistic, and Gompertz models, for rice hulls, and the Orskov and McDonald model, for cassava chips, were significant (P < 0.1) according to Mayer’s test, indicating lack of fit of the model. Besides presenting the lowest MSPE, the models that showed fit according to Mayer’s test were the two-pool logistic for rice hulls and cassava chips, and the two-pool exponential for sugarcane, turnip, and peach palm. Thus, the non-linear two-pool models are the most efficient in adjusting to the curve and in the generation of parameters of cumulative production of gases from the tested feedstuffs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33240/25019,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Ingestive behavior and temperament of Nellore cattle classified for residual feed intake,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ingestive behavior, temperament and residual feed intake (RFI) in Nellore cattle. Sixty-two bulls and 56 heifers after weaning, housed in individual pens, were evaluated in individual performance tests. Animals were classified as low RFI ( 0.135 kg day-1; greater than mean plus 0.5 standard deviation). Ingestive behavior was evaluated for 24 h by direct observation, every 24 days in bulls or every 10 days in heifers. Temperament was assessed by flight speed, reactivity in mobile confinement, composite score, and serum cortisol measurement. The most efficient animals (low RFI, 5.6 kg DM day-1) consumed 7% less feed than animals with medium efficiency (mean RFI, 6.0 kg DM day-1) and 13% less than the least efficient animals (high RFI, 6.34 kg DM day-1). More feed efficient animals spent a longer time feeding and ruminating per kg of DM consumed. Similarly, more efficient animals consumed less DM per hour and ruminated less DM per hour, but made the same number of visits to the feed bunk. High-efficiency animals were 13% and 35% faster to walk 1.77 m after release from the scale than medium- and low-efficiency animals, respectively, suggesting a more reactive temperament without differences in reactivity, composite score, or serum cortisol. Feed efficiency is associated with ingestive behavior and temperament in Nellore cattle. More efficient animals consume and ruminate less feed over the same period of time than animals with medium and low feed efficiency. In addition, more efficient animals exhibit a faster flight speed and are more reactive than less efficient animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33342/25020,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Meat quality of Pantaneiro lambs at different body weights,"The aim of this study was to assess the meat quality of Pantaneiro lambs finished in confinement and slaughtered at different body weights (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 kg). Forty-five non-castrated male Pantaneiro lambs were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and nine replicates. The animals were housed in individual pens and slaughtered when they reached the target weights. For instrumental and centesimal analyses, the Semimembranosus, Longissimus lumborum, Gluteobiceps, and Triceps brachii muscles were used, whereas for fatty acid profile analysis only the Longissimus lumborum muscle was used. The different body weights influenced the final pH of the meat, but this still remained within the recommended values; however, the meat of heavier lambs had increased water-holding capacity (WHC), redness (a*), and fat content, making it the tenderest but least luminous and humid meat. Greater body weight led to a higher saturated fatty acid (SFA) content, reduction of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), higher hypercholesterolemic fatty acid content (H), and higher atherogenicity (AI) and thrombogenicity indexes (TI). Therefore, it was concluded that the meat of lambs slaughtered at lower body weight presented better nutritional quality, making it more suitable for human consumption.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33101/25018,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Whole and ground grain sorghum and the free choice feeding system in broiler diets,"This experiment evaluates the zootechnical performance, yield of cuts, carcass composition, and intake of metabolizable energy, lysine, and methionine + cystine in male broilers from 21 to 42 days of age fed diets based on whole and ground grain sorghum and corn. A total of 112 birds of the Cobb 500 lineage were divided into 28 cages (four animals per cage) in a completely randomized design with four treatments and seven replications. Treatments consisted of diets based on ground corn and soybean meal (control, T1), ground sorghum and soybean meal (treatment 2, T2), whole grain sorghum and soybean meal (treatment 3, T3), and the diet T3 separated in feeders in the fractions (a) whole grain sorghum and (b) concentrate containing the other ingredients of the mixed feed (free choice feeding) (treatment 4, T4). The variables feed intake, body weight, feed conversion, viability, breast, drumstick and thigh yield , bromatological composition of breast and drumstick + thigh, and daily intakes of metabolizable energy, lysine and methionine + cystine were studied. The whole grain sorghum in diets is viable, contributes to reducing factory and logistics costs in the poultry industry, and promotes the same results of zootechnical performance, yields, and bromatological composition of cuts when compared to diets with ground corn and sorghum. Diets with whole grain sorghum in the free choice feeding system may be a viable alternative because birds sought to meet their daily needs for metabolizable energy and digestible amino acids even in short periods of adaptation to the diets, as demonstrated in the experiment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32887/25015,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Metabolizable energy levels in diets with high lysine for growing and finishing pigs,"The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of metabolizable energy (ME) levels in diets with high digestible lysine concentration on performance, carcass traits, and meat quality of barrows from 95 to 158 days of age. Eighty commercial hybrid barrows (50 ± 1.82 kg) selected for lean meat deposition, were assigned to four dietary treatments (3,150, 3,235, 3,320, and 3,400 kcal EM kg-1) in a randomized design with 10 replicate pens per treatment and two pigs per pen. From 95 to 116 days of age, we observed no effects of ME on final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), metabolizable energy intake (MEI), and feed conversion (F: G). Average daily feed intake (ADFI) decreased linearly with increasing ME levels (? = 5.79961 - 0.00096790X - r2 = 0.89). From 95 to 137 days of age, no effects of ME were observed on final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), metabolizable energy intake (MEI), and feed conversion (F: G). Average daily feed intake (ADFI) decreased linearly with increasing ME (?= 6.1176 - 0.001X - r2= 0.97). From 95 to 158 days, of age no effects of ME were observed on FBW and ADG. Dietary ME influenced the ADFI and F: G, which decreased linearly with increasing ME concentrations (?= 8.12951 - 0.00149X - r2= 0.99; ?= 6.0914 - 0.001X - r² = 0.75, respectively). There was a linear increase in loin eye area (LEA) with increasing ME (? = - 29.851 + 0.0207 X - r² = 0.87). Backfat thickness, pH, and temperature, measured at different times after slaughter (0 min, 45 min, 3 h, and 24 h), were not affected by dietary ME. The level of ME also did not affect the meat quality parameters Color L*, Color a*, Color b*, Warner-Bratzler shear force, thaw water losses, cooking water losses, sum of water losses, intramuscular fat content, and TBARS. Diets with 3,400 kcal kg-1 ME, corresponding to 2.75, 2.57, and 2.31 g digestible lysine/Mcal of ME for pigs from 95 to 116, 116 to 137, and 95 to 158 days of age, respectively, resulted in best performance and carcass traits, without negative effects on meat quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32714/25009,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Spray-dried egg in the diet of dogs: implications for recovery nutritional, palatability and haematology","There is a growing demand for alternative protein sources in dog nutrition due to the high cost of the ingredient. Spray-dried egg (SDE) is a potential protein source in this context. The objective of this study was to evaluate the digestibility, palatability, and blood profile of diets containing different amounts of spray-dried egg (SDE) and the blood parameters of dogs fed these diets. For the study of digestibility and faecal quality (Experiment 1), eight Beagles were distributed in a double Latin square design (4X4), with four treatments (0, 4, 8, and 12% SDE) and four periods, totalling eight repetitions per treatment. In experiment 2, to evaluate palatability, 20 dogs were presented with two diets: 0% SDE vs 4% SDE. To evaluate the haematological factors (Experiment 3), eight dogs were maintained in a single group and were initially fed a control diet (0%SDE) for 10 days, followed by a diet containing 12% SDE for 10 days. In Experiment 1, a linear increase was found in the coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) and in the metabolisable energy (ME) as the level of SDE was increased in the diet. The CTTAD of DM and CP in SDE and the ME obtained by regression analysis were 93.6%, 91.3%, and 5738.9 kcal kg-1, respectively, demonstrating that SDE is a highly digestible protein source for dogs. There were no changes in the stool characteristics of dogs fed SDE. The results of Experiment 2 indicate that the dogs preferred the diet that included 4% SDE. In the haematological study (Experiment 3), increases in albumin, red blood cells, haemoglobin, and total circulating protein were observed, with no change in the other histological variables. The inclusion of SDE improved the digestibility and palatability of the diet and increased the albumin content, red blood cell count, haemoglobin level, and total protein level without changing the faecal characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33081/25017,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Twenty-seven castrated, purebred and Charolais-Nelore crossbred steers with a mean age of 20 ± 1,5 months and initial mean live weight of 293 ± 31 kg, were distributed in three treatments: Protected Urea (concentrate containing slow degradation urea ); Soybean meal (concentrate containing soybean meal) and Urea Common (concentrate containing common urea). A randomized block experimental design (racial predominance) was used, with three treatments and nine replications, with the animal as the experimental unit. Feeding treatments did not influence the hot and cold carcass weight and yield. The fat thickness that covered the carcass was not altered, according to the diets studied, being on average 3.97 ± 0.94 mm. The measurements and the carcass compactness were not altered by the diets, presenting average values of 127.55; 74.86; 39.86; 38.84 and 25.72 cm for carcass length, leg and arm, arm perimeter and cushion thickness, respectively. A significant difference was observed in marbling, and the meat of the animals treated with soybean meal were higher than those treated with protected urea (3.72 vs 2.28 points).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32129/25008,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Applicability of management tools to the correction of weaknesses in family dairy farms in the Western Amazon,"The aim of this study was to analyse the applicability of management tools associated with technical assistance to family dairy farms with the aim of identifying and correcting weaknesses. A total of 100 dairy farms located in the mesoregion of the Acre Valley, in the Western Amazon, were analysed from March 2016 to March 2017. The data used were collected via a semi-structured form containing 549 questions, through on-site observation and from the owners during the diagnosis. To define the weaknesses, a multidisciplinary team used the brainstorming management tool. The main weaknesses obtained using the GUT Matrix, in descending order, were: a lack of drinking fountains, no vaccination of all heifers against brucellosis, low body condition of cows at calving, and a calving interval longer than 12 months. Based on the ranking of the weaknesses, the research team defined the management tools to be used to correct or at least mitigate the weaknesses: PDCA, 5W2H, and/or a fishbone diagram. Among the 20 most graded weaknesses, the management tools used by the extensionist technician obtained significant results in solving the problems. It was concluded that it is possible to adapt and apply the management tools used in other activities to dairy farming and that they can be used continuously for management or specifically to establish a plan or project.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32002/25007,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Temperature, thermal comfort, and animal ingestion behavior in a silvopastoral system","Thermal discomfort is one of the main causes of production losses in animals fully exposed to solar radiation under extensive livestock farming. The inclusion of trees in this farming system is the most efficient strategy to decrease the temperature and increase animal productivity without the need to explore new areas. In this context, the objective of this study was to characterize the microclimate in a silvopastoral system (SPS), a refuge area, and an open pasture, and evaluate thermal comfort and the ingestive behavior of animals under shade. The study was conducted at the Agronomic Institute of Paraná (IAPAR), located in Ibiporã, Paraná state, Brazil, in three areas with distinct management systems: a SPS of Eucalyptus grandis with Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.), a woodland of Leucena leucocephala that provided shade to cattle, and a pasture in full sun (PFS). Automatic meteorological stations were installed in the SPS (one station beside the tree lines and the other in an average distance perpendicular to the rows), one in the refuge area, and one in the PFS. The measured variables were air temperature and relative humidity. The mean temperatures of the shaded treatments were compared to those of the PFS using a t-test. The mean values of the temperature and humidity index (THI) were calculated for each season of the year. The animal ingestion behavior in the SPS was analyzed in three typical days in different seasons of the year. Significant differences were observed between shade treatments and full-sun pasture, with a temperature decrease ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 °C in the shaded systems. The comparison of animal thermal comfort between the study areas in different seasons of the year indicated that there were no significant differences in thermal comfort between the SPS and refuge area relative to the PFS, suggesting a need to monitor the animals’ body temperature to better estimate thermal comfort. The evaluation of the ingestive behavior evidenced the animals’ preference to perform activities under tree shade and that the SPS led to changes in their food habits, optimizing grazing time. Therefore, the trees directly affected the microclimate of the studied environments, attenuating the temperature, protecting the animals against direct solar radiation, and providing better thermal comfort.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32990/25016,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effect of workforce diversity on the cost-effectiveness of milk production systems participating in the “full bucket” program,"This study aimed to analyze the effect of each workforce type on the cost-effectiveness of 20 dairy farms participating in the “Full Bucket” program, from January to December 2011, in the State of Rio de Janeiro. A stepwise multiple linear regression was used to identify the production cost components that most affected net margin, profitability, and cost-effectiveness. Workforce type influenced both profitability and cost-effectiveness, as well as total production cost. Economic analysis showed that farms with a hired workforce had the lowest total unit costs and a positive result. This way, the activity is able to produce in the long term and farmers are capitalizing. The farms that adopted mixed and family workforce had a positive net margin and a negative result, obtaining conditions to produce in the medium term. The highest representativeness on the items of effective operating cost in the family workforce stratum, in a descending order, were food, miscellaneous expenses, and energy. The most representative items in the mixed and hired workforce strata were food, workforce, and miscellaneous expenses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32000/25080,E-ISSN 1679-0359

At 30, 60 and 85 days old, the chickens and leftovers were weighed again to estimate the feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG), feed conversion (FC) and final weight (FW) from 1 to 30 days, from 1 to 60 days and from 1 to 85 days old. To evaluate diet metabolisability, a three-day total excreta collection (26 to 28 days of age) was performed. A quadratic effect was reported for diet metabolisability, in which the minimum substitution level was 17.45% and 17.69% for apparent metabolisable energy (AME) and nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn), respectively. Based on performance, it is recommended to replace 40% soybean meal protein with cottonseed cake protein.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32879/25014,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Quality of cheese produced with milk from cows fed forage palm with different forages,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of forage palm combined with different forages in the diet of F1 Holstein x Zebu cows, on the quality of Minas Frescal cheese. Two simultaneous 4 x 4 Latin squares were used in the experimental design. The treatments consisted of sorghum silage as the sole forage source; replacement of 50% sorghum silage by forage palm; elephant grass as the only forage source; 50% replacement of elephant grass by forage palm. Milk samples from each cow were analyzed for the chemical composition and the milk was pasteurized for cheese production. The gross and adjusted yields, texture, chemical and sensorial characteristics and fatty acid profile were evaluated. The chemical composition of the cheese was not influenced by the diets, as well as the sum of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, a lower stearic acid content was found in cheese from the milk of cows fed grass with forage palm and a lower value of conjugated linoleic acid for the diet with silage alone. In the consumer preference ranking test, the most preferred cheese was that of the sorghum silage diet and the least preferred was that of the sorghum silage/forage palm diet. In the overall impression, higher scores were assigned to cheeses of the treatments with exclusive silage or elephant grass. The replacement of 50% sorghum silage or elephant grass by the forage palm did not change the chemical composition of the Minas Frescal cheese, however, it modified the profile of fatty acids and decreased the acceptance and preference of cheese by the consumers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31140/25005,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Milk fatty acid composition of dairy goats fed increasing levels of Flemingia macrophylla hay,"The effect of dietary inclusion of increasing levels of Flemingia macrophylla hay on the yield, composition and fatty acid profile of milk from Saanen x Boer goats was evaluated. The diets were composed of 40% concentrate and 60% forage. The treatments were defined by the level of inclusion of Flemingia hay in the diet (0, 80, 160, 240 and 320 g kg-1 dry matter) in replacement of the Cynodon dactylon cv. Tifton-85 hay, distributed according to a 5 x 5 Latin Square design. The inclusion of Flemingia in the diet did not change the milk yield or milk fat content but promoted a quadratic effect on the fat yield. A quadratic effect was observed on the milk protein and lactose contents, but this effect was not reflected in the daily production of these components. The concentrations of vaccenic, rumenic, elaidic and trans-10 C18:1 fatty acids in milk fat increased linearly in response to the dietary inclusion of Flemingia, whereas the contents of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and ?-linolenic fatty acids were not modified. A linear reduction was observed in the lauric and myristic fatty acids concentrations, which was accompanied by a reduction in the atherogenic index of milk fat. A quadratic effect was also observed on the trans-10, cis-12 CLA milk fat content in response to the inclusion of Flemingia in the diet, as well as a linear increase in the apparent transfer of ?-linolenic acid from the diet to milk. The inclusion of up to 320 g kg-1 of Flemingia hay as a replacement for Tifton-85 hay in the Saanen x Boer dairy goat diet does not modify the milk production and improves the nutritional quality of milk fat by increasing the contents of rumenic and vaccenic acids beneficial to human health and reducing the concentrations of hypercholesterolemic fatty acids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31081/25079,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effect of post-grazing residual leaf blade-length on the regrowth vigor of Piatã grass grazed under intermittent stocking,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of post-grazing residual leaf blades (RLB) of different lengths on the morphogenic and structural characteristics of Urochloa brizantha ‘Piatã’ grazed upon by beef cattle. A completely randomized design was used, with three RLB lengths (2, 4, and 6 cm) and two paddocks as replicates over two grazing seasons (wet and wet-dry transition). To monitor the weekly forage growth, two representative clumps and 48 tillers per treatment were marked after grazing. The procedure continued until the plants reached the target pre-grazing height of 35–40 cm. Morphogenic characteristics were not affected by the treatments or seasons, with minor changes observed in mean sheath length (MSL) within season and tiller population density (TPD). The MSL reached its peak value of 210.37 mm during the wet season relative to 175.89 mm during the wet-dry transition. The TPD reached its lowest value (680 tillers m-2) at the highest defoliation intensity (2 cm) relative to that at the lowest defoliation intensity (720 tillers m-2). The different RLB lengths modified canopy height variably; canopy height was the highest with the 6 cm leaves (24.31 cm), but did not vary between the 2 cm and 4 cm leaves. The post-grazing leaf area index and interception of photosynthetically active radiation were modified by season. The highest defoliation intensity (2 cm) increased the rest period by seven days when compared with the lowest defoliation intensity (6 cm).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29670/25002,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Morphogenic and structural characteristics of tropical forage grasses managed under different regrowth periods in the Brazilian semi-arid region,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphogenetic and structural characteristics of tropical grasses managed under different regrowth periods. The experiment was conducted at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology Education of Rio Grande do Norte, located in the municipality of Apodi-RN, Brazil. The study design was in randomized blocks and the treatments were allocated in a 3x4 factorial arrangement, with three cultivars (Andropogon, Buffel and Massai) in four regrowth periods (21, 35, 49 and 63 days). The interaction between cultivar and age was significant for all studied variables, with the exception of leaf blade width and accumulation rate. The highest leaf appearance rates were observed in Buffel grass, regardless of the regrowth age. This characteristic was not influenced by age only in Andropogon grass. Higher stem elongation rates were observed in Buffel grass, while the lowest were observed in Massai grass until 35 days of regrowth, attributed to the presence of inflorescences. Canopy heights in Massai and Andropogon grass were greater than Buffel grass until 35 days of regrowth, Andropogon grass had higher height from 35 days of regrowth than the others. Andropogon grass showed higher rates of accumulation than Massai grass only at 21 days of regrowth, and no effects of regrowth age were observed for this variable. Buffel grass should be defoliated at 21 days, while Andropogon and Massai grass can be managed without losses between 21 and 63 days of regrowth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30215/25003,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Technical cashew nut shell liquid associated with non-protein nitrogen sources in high-grain diets for ruminants: intake and digestibility of nutrients, ruminal fermentation, and microbial protein synthesis","This study aimed to evaluate the association of technical cashew nut shell liquid (tCNSL) and two sources of non-protein nitrogen (NPN), dry matter intake (DMI), the partial and total apparent digestibility coefficient of nutrients, ruminal fermentation, microbial synthesis, and blood characteristics. Four Holstein steers (438 kg ± 17.14 kg) fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannula were used. Diets had (in DM basis) 135 g kg?1 of crude protein and 746 g kg?1 of total digestive nutrients. The roughage to concentrate ratio was 30:70. The experimental design was a 4 x 4 Latin square with 14-day experimental periods. The non-protein nitrogen sources used were livestock urea (U) and slow-release urea (SRU) (Optigen® II). The treatments consisted of diets containing U or SRU associated or not with tCNSL. The tCNSL was added to the diet in a proportion of 300 mg kg?1 of concentrate. DMI and ruminal, intestinal and total apparent digestibility coefficients of nutrients were not affected by experimental diets. The association of sources of NPN and tCNSL did not affect pH, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), and microbial synthesis of animals consuming high-grain diets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27482/25001,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effect of nitrogen fertilization on structure and tillering dynamics of Piata palisade grass during the deferment period,"Nitrogen fertilization can increase the appearance of new tillers, which can improve the structure of deferred sward, since the deferral period is not long. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of nitrogen fertilization on structure and tillering dynamics of Piata palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piata) during deferment. We evaluated three nitrogen fertilization levels (none - 0 kg ha -1; medium - 75 kg ha -1; and high - 150 kg ha -1) associated with deferment periods (1, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days). The experimental design was set in completely randomised blocks in a split-plot arrangement, with three replications. The deferment period influenced foliage area index quadratically (p < 0.01) at all fertilization levels. The improvement in nitrogen fertilization levels increased light interception and reduced the foliage angle, but it did not affect tillering dynamics of Piata palisade grass during the deferment period. Appearance and mortality rates, the balance between tiller appearance and mortality and the stability index of the population of aerial and basal tillers of Piata palisade grass were higher at the beginning of the pasture deferment period. Nitrogen fertilization does not stimulate appearance of tillers on deferred Piata palisade grass. Tiller population stability, however, is only high at the beginning of deferment, decreasing after this initial period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27383/25000,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Prevalence and distribution of feet lesions in dairy cows raised in the freestall,"Foot lesions are one of the main causes of productivity losses in the dairy industry. In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of claudication and distribution of hoof lesions by associating them with preventive hoof trimming, as well as list the main causes of involuntary discarding and the main health problems reported in dairy farms. The study included 10 farms distributed in 7 municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state. The body condition score (BCS) and locomotion score (LS) of the cows were assessed. Hoof examination, lesion classification, and hoof trimming of the animals were performed. Of the 492 animals, 38.4% presented lameness and 36% had foot lesions, 81.4% of which were observed in the pelvic limbs and 19.6% in the thoracic limbs. Of the lesions in the limbs, 47.1% were of infectious origin and 52.9% were noninfectious. The main lesions were sole ulcers (31.6%), digital dermatitis (30.3%), thin soles (12%), and interdigital dermatitis (11.2%). Cows aged 4 to 6 years had a higher number of lesions and a higher LS. Preventive hoof trimming reduced the chances of lameness by 55% as the locomotive system was the main sanitary problem and the first reason for involuntary disposal of the farms. The results show that dairy cows raised in a free stall system have a high prevalence of claudication and foot diseases. These data should be taken into account when altering the livestock management of these animals in order to reduce significant economic losses in the herd.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32977/25129,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Structural plasticity and isolation of umbilical cord progenitor cells of agouti (Dasyprocta prymnolopha) raised in captivity,"The agouti has been used as an experimental model in several studies focused on reproductive biology. The umbilical cord, an embryonic attachment that connects the foetus to the placenta, has been reported as an important anatomical site for obtaining stem cells. The objective of this study was to describe macro- and microscopically the umbilical cord of agoutis at different stages of gestation, to expand and cultivate in vitro the progenitor cells and to report their morphological characteristics. Seven cutias were submitted to caesarean section to collect the umbilical cords: five were destined for studies of cord structure in different stages of gestation (30, 35, 50, 75 and 100 days postcoital), and two were collected in the third stage of gestation for isolation and cell culture. The umbilical cord of cutias assumes a spiral arrangement, with veins and arteries on it starting 50 days after coitus. The arteries present an outer layer of smooth muscle fibres in a longitudinal and circular arrangement and a medium layer of smooth muscle fibres with only longitudinal and intimate orientation and coated by the endothelium. The veins consist of longitudinal smooth muscle fibres with an extract of smooth muscle cells, and the endothelium, in all analysed gestational phases, is a structure bounded by simple pavement epithelial tissue originating from the amnion, adhered to Wharton's Jelly and forming the umbilical vessels and allantoid duct. The proposed protocol allowed the collection of a high cellular concentration of umbilical cord progenitor cells from viable cutias.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32905/24998,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Testicular and seminal evaluation of dogs naturally infected with Leishmania sp.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the testicular changes and detect the presence of Leishmania sp. in the testicles and semen of dogs with Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). The animals were obtained from the Zoonoses Control Department of Teresina, PI, and taken to the kennel of the Agricultural Sciences Center of the Federal University of Piauí, where they remained were maintained for two months and subsequently euthanized for testicles removal. Semen samples were collected from 12 dogs, 06 positive and 06 negative for VL. The following diagnostic techniques readouts were assessed for the sampled animals: testosterone dosage, immunohistochemistry (IMH), histopathology of the slides containing the testicular material, and seminal evaluation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Testosterone values remained within the normal range for the canine specie and did not differ statistically among the experimental groups but displayed lower serum concentrations than those of the control group. All the testicular and semen samples from the dogs were negative for VL as determined by techniques IMH and PCR, respectively. The results of testicle histopathology revealed the presence of several lesions with statistical difference among the experimental groups. Parasitized dogs with VL have testicular lesions that may compromise the reproductive efficiency of these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32739/24997,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Use of measurements from thoracic radiographs to identify high mean left atrium pressure in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease,"The aim of this study was to estimate echocardiographic elevated mean left atrium pressure (MLAP) based on measurements from thoracic radiographs and to determine a cut-off value for each radiographic measurement that suggests a high MLAP. A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to include cases admitted from January 2015 to December 2016. Thoracic radiographic examinations from 93 dogs with and without a high MLAP were included. Specific measurements were made from thoracic radiographs and compared with echocardiographic variables known to indicate high MLAP. This comparison was used to generate equations that allowed the estimation of echocardiographic surrogates from the radiographic measurements. The values indicative of high MLAP were obtained using a regression curve. Formulas that indicated high MLAP were generated using a number of radiographic measurements. Positive echocardiographic findings of high MLAP were used as the gold standard. These formulas helped to predict high MLAP in myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) without the need for echocardiographic examination. The best formula was left atrium (LA):aorta (Ao)echo = 0.03×(vertebral heart score,VHS) + 0.14×(LA) + 0.27×(LA:caudal vena cava (CVC)rad). Values ? 12.2v for VHS, ? 4.5cm for LA, ? 3.3 for LA:Aorad and ? 3.2 for LA:CVCrad suggested high MLAP. Thus, we propose equations, based on measurements from thoracic radiographs, to identify high MLAP. Simple radiographic thoracic measurements, such as LA:CVCrad, can be used to define overload and a high MLAP in dogs with MMVD.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32654/24995,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Sanitary aspects of the herd and milk quality in family farming properties in the Western Amazon,"The aim of this study was to analyze 100 dairy farms under family farming regime from the mesoregion of the Acre Valley in the Western Amazon, regarding the sanitary and milk quality aspects, considering different levels of milk yield. The data were collected from March to June 2016, from a semi-structured form, containing 301 questions, through on-site observation, as well as the answers obtained with the owners; and recorded in SPSS® spreadsheets. The descriptive statistics was adopted and, with the aid of the cluster analysis methodology, the cowmen were divided into two clusters with different characteristics in terms of productivity (higher and lower). Some relevant differences among the properties were identified: those belonging to the higher productivity cluster had higher family income and showed greater use of technologies, such as expansion tank and milking machine. In addition, they showed higher vaccination rates against clostridial diseases and rabies. Regarding milk quality, there was higher pre-dipping indices. Milk analyses (somatic cell count, total bacteria count, temperature, protein, fat, bacterial inhibitors, reductase and milk solids-not-fat) were performed on any property. It was concluded that actions are needed to improve productivity and aspects related to milk quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32186/25047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Variation in the content of defatted dry extract in cooling tanks milk samples of dairy farms,"The defatted dry extract (DDE) comprises of the solid constituents of the milk, except for the fat, and must have a minimum established content of 8.4% for raw milk in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the effects of commercialized milk volume, somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) on the DDE content of dairy farm milk samples. The sampling included data from monthly milk analyzes of dairy farms, which supply four dairy industries located in the state of Santa Catarina, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, and comprised of 106.470 observations sampled in 2015.The data were submitted to variance and regression analysis. To evaluate the influence of the volume of milk commercialized by the farmers, the SCC and TBC levels, and the levels of DDE, the values of these explanatory variables were stratified in quintiles. The mean DDE was 8.55%, with 25.6% of the samples being below the established minimum. In regard to the volume of milk marketed by the farmers, seasonal variations were observed in all quintiles of dairy farms analyzed, but with lower levels of DDE in milk samples from small farms throughout the year. Samples of milk with high TBC and, especially high SCC, presented lower percentage of DDE during the year. It is concluded that the DDE content of milk is related to the season of the year, the production volume per dairy, SCC and TBC.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32662/24996,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Bioactive compounds and enzymatic activity in minimally processed eggplant packedunderactive modified atmosphere,"The study aimed to assess bioactive compounds and polyphenoloxidase activity of minimally processed eggplants stored in different atmospheres. Eggplants (Solanum melongena L.; cv. Ciça) were minimally processed (MP), sanitized and treated with a 2% citric acid solution. They were packed in plastic containers (vacuum) of nylon + transparent polyethylene and submitted to modified atmospheres with the following concentrations of gases: control (atmospheric air), vacuum, 4% O2 + 5% CO2,4% O2 + 6% CO2, 4% O2 + 7% CO2, and 4% O2 + 8% CO2, being stored in a cold chamber (5 ± 1 °C and 90 ± 1% relative humidity) for 10 days. The analyses consisted of the total phenolic compounds, total antioxidant activity, flavonoids, and polyphenoloxidase activity. The experimental design was a completely randomized design in a 6 × 6 factorial scheme (treatment vs. storage period). The data were submitted to analysis of variance and a regression analysis was performed for storage time. The active modified atmosphere with 8% CO2 is effective in reducing the polyphenoloxidase activity in minimally processed eggplant. The contents of phenolic compounds and flavonoids of minimally processed eggplant decrease with storage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33083/24991,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Detection of virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Escherichia coli isolates from raw milk and artisanal cheese in Southern Brazil,"The serrano artisanal cheese is a typical product from South region of Brazil, which is produced by skilled cheesemakers using raw milk. The contamination of this food by Escherichia coli has a great impact on public health, since it could threat the consumers’ health. The study evaluated the presence of virulence genes, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and bofilm-production ability of Escherichia coli isolates obtained from raw milk and artisanal cheese produced in Southern Brazil. A total of 117 isolates of E. coli were characterized by multiplex PCR to detect the following virulence genes: eae for enteropatogenic E. coli (EPEC), lt and st for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), stx for shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), stx and eae for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), ipaH for enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and aggR for enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility profile to 22 antimicrobial agents was also performed by disk diffusion method, and we searched for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and/or carbapenemase- producing isolates. Isolates that were positive for ESBL and carbapenemase were further investigated for the presence of the genes: blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M, for ESBL and blaOXA-48 for carbapenemase. Further, isolates had their ability to form biofilms investigated by the red Congo agar method. Virulence genes of E. coli were identified in 21.37% of the tested isolates, which were classified as EPEC (the most prevalent pathotype) and ETEC or EAEC. Ten (8.55%) of the total studied E. coli isolates revealed a multidrug-resistant profile, since they were resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes; whereas four isolates (3.42%) were classified as ESBL-producers and showed the presence of blaTEM gene. None of the isolates exhibited carbapenemase activity nor did they carry carbapenemase genes. From the total of E. coli isolates, 79 (67.52%) were considered potential biofilm producers. These results address a serious public health issue, since artisanal cheeses pose a risk to consumers’ health, since may be sources of dissemination of diarrheogenic E. coli, that can cause from subclinical to severe and fatal infections in children and adults, and also emphasize the need to improve adaptations/adjustments in the manufacturing processes of these products.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34000/24993,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Decrease in the number of agricultural farms in the state of Paraná, Brazil","Issues related to farms have begun to be discussed in a global context due to their importance in the economic development process, as they have a direct impact on the social transformations within and away from the countryside and are an important part of the system ensuring the food supply and food security for the population. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the trends in the number of farms in the rural areas of Paraná, Brazil, by main type of activity and by land size category for the period from 2002 to 2014. Data from the National Household Sample Survey were used, and the mean annual variation rates were calculated via Student’s t-test using a log-linear ordinary least squares regression model. A reduction of 3.5% per annum (pa) was seen in the number of farms, both in relation to main activities and land size. There was a sharper decline in the number of farms dedicated to soybean (8.9% pa) and corn (6.3% pa) production and in the number of farms ranging in size from 10 ha to < 100 ha of land (7.09% pa). This information may support the establishment of public actions focused on the farming sector in Paraná.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33144/24990,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Viability of probiotic bacteria in tropical mango juice and the resistance of the strains to gastrointestinal conditions simulated in vitro,"This study evaluated the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-05, Lactobacillus plantarum LP299v and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in tropical mango juice, the resistance of the strains to gastrointestinal conditions simulated in vitro and the microbiological, physicochemical and sensory characteristics of the products obtained. The viabilities of L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum LP299v were greater than 7.96 log CFU mL-1 and 7.74 log CFU mL-1, respectively, during the 28 days of storage at 8 °C. However, there was a reduction (p < 0.05) in the viability of L. acidophilus La-5 after 21 days of storage, with counts of 3.81 log UFC mL-1. The parameters of pH, total soluble solids, luminosity (L*) and the color coordinates, a* and b*, did not differ between the treatments. However, the pH and acidity varied during the storage time, probably due to the fermentative action of the microorganisms. For the in vitro gastrointestinal resistance test, there was a difference in the gastric phase for enteric phases I and II. The mean viability of the microorganisms in the gastric phase was 5.11 log CFU mL-1, decreasing to 4.02 and 3.97 log CFU mL-1 in enteric phases I and II, respectively. Juices containing L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum LP299 were evaluated sensorially, presenting good acceptability. The results suggest that the tropical mango juice was a good carrier matrix for L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum LP 299v, being well accepted and therefore an alternative for populations with dietary restrictions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33265/24992,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,VIS-NIR spectral reflectance for discretization of soils with high sand content,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the spatial distribution and relationships between the physicochemical attributes and radiometry of soils with high sand contents. One hundred surface horizon samples were collected for physicochemical and spectral analyses of the soil. The samples were selected spatially by the conditioned Latin hypercube method. The physicochemical analyses consisted of granulometry, organic carbon content, and iron oxides content, extracted using sodium dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB). The spectral response of the soils was analyzed in the 400 to 1000 nm range. The spectral curves were obtained from the samples of the surface horizons, which were categorized according to the attribute in question. The relationship between the soil physicochemical attributes and soil radiometry was evaluated through a Pearson's correlation. There was a tendency for the organic carbon content to decrease with an increase in soil depth, associated with the presence of soils with higher sand contents. For soils with iron contents lower than 80 g kg-1, there was an increase in the reflectance along the spectrum, whereas for soils with contents between 80 and 160 g kg-1, the reflectance decreased after 600 nm, with greater variation along the spectrum for soils with iron contents higher than 120 g kg-1. The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy could potentially allow for granulometric distinction between the soils evaluated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32765/24988,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Analysis of cassava growth at different harvest times and planting densities,"Vegetative canopy architecture, and plant population density, has a direct influence on the growth and production of crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth of four cassava cultivars of contrasting canopies, in four population densities, during two vegetative cycles. A randomized complete block design was used in a subdivided plot scheme, with two replications, with the population densities in the plots and harvesting times in the subplots. ‘Branca de Santa Catarina’ (BSC), ‘IAC 13’, ‘IAC 14-18’ and ‘Fibra’ were collected every four months, beginning at 120 and ending at 720 days after planting (DAP). Primary data on dry matter and leaf area were calculated. The total dry mass (Wt), leaf area ratio (La), leaf area index (L), relative growth rate (Rw), and net assimilation rate (Ea) were calculated based on the primary data. All cultivars accumulated more total dry mass (Wt) at lower planting densities. The plants reached a higher leaf area ratio (La) 120 days after planting. In the second vegetative cycle, the four cultivars, independently of the population, presented a reduction of assimilate translocation to the leaves. Relative growth rate (Rw) of the cultivars varied strongly with the plant population only in the second cycle. ‘IAC 14-18’ showed greater dependence on spacing, and ‘Fibra’ less dependence. Growth (Rw) and assimilatory (Ea) rates decreased at the end of the first cycle, then increased slowly until the end of the second cycle of vegetation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32778/24989,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Um estudo foi conduzido para investigar a eficácia da coinoculação de Rhizobium tropici e Azospirillum brasilense e da adubação nitrogenada em cobertura na nodulação, no crescimento e no rendimento de grãos do feijoeiro (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivado em solo arenoso da região do Cerrado brasileiro, durante duas safras de produção (“safra das águas” e “safra da seca”). O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos casualizados em esquema de parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetições. As parcelas constituíram de quatro tratamento de inoculação das sementes: controle (não inoculado); inoculação com Rhizobium tropici; inoculação com Azospirillum brasilense; e, coinoculação com R. tropici e A. brasilense; e as subparcelas por cinco doses de N em cobertura (0, 30, 60, 90 e 120 kg ha-1). A inoculação das sementes com Rhizobium tropici isoladamente ou combinado com Azospirillum brasilense melhorou a nodulação das raízes e o rendimento de grãos do feijoeiro comum quando a cultura foi cultivada durante a “safra da seca”. Portanto, a resposta positiva da inoculação das sementes com Rhizobium e Azospirillum no rendimento de grãos depende das condições ambientais durante a safra de produção, especialmente da menor taxa de precipitação pluvial por estimular a nodulação das raízes. A inoculação com A. brasilense isoladamente não foi uma prática agronômica eficiente para ser utilizada no cultivo do feijoeiro nas condições brasileiras, resultando em rendimento de grãos equivalente às plantas do tratamento não inoculado nas duas safras de produção. O aumento das doses de adubação nitrogenada em cobertura inibe a formação e o crescimento dos nódulos radiculares do feijoeiro. A dose de adubação nitrogenada em cobertura ótima para o cultivo do feijoeiro em solos arenosos da região do Cerrado brasileiro pode variar entre 80 e 90 kg ha-1 de N.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32657/24987,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effects of calcium and magnesium silicate on the absorption of silicon and nutrients in wheat,"Wheat is a plant that accumulates silicon (Si). The application of silicon to the soil may influence the absorption of nutrients by the plant and, therefore, its nutritional balance. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of calcium and magnesium silicate (CaSiO3/MgSiO3) on the ability of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to utilize silicon and absorb nutrients from soils collected in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using 8-L plastic pots and three types of soil. Treatments were arranged in randomized blocks (3 × 5 factorial design): three soils [Rhodic Acrudox (Ox1), Rhodic Hapludox (Ox2), and Arenic Hapludult (Ult)], five silicate rates (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 t ha–1 of calcium/magnesium silicate), and four replications were performed. The effects of calcium and magnesium silicate on the concentrations of Si, N, P, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, S, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ within leaves were evaluated. Silicon concentrations in wheat leaves and stems increased with increasing rates of calcium and magnesium silicate applied to the soil. Wheat shoots accumulated averages of 28.2% (Ox1), 60.61% (Ult), and 74.14% (Ox2) of the Si from the silicate applied to the soil. Silicate fertilization increased the amount of Ca+2 and Mg+2 within leaves and reduced the amount of Zn2+ and Mn2+ within leaves. Calcium and magnesium silicate prevented excessive amounts of Mn2+ from being absorbed by wheat, improving the balance in the absorption of this nutrient.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32655/25077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Determination of vegetation cover index under different soil management systems of cover plants by using an unmanned aerial vehicle with an onboard digital photographic camera,"The permanent monitoring of vegetation cover is important to guarantee a sustainable management of agricultural activities, with a relevant role in the reduction of water erosion. This monitoring can be carried out through different indicators such as vegetation cover indices. In this study, the vegetation cover index was obtained using uncalibrated RGB images generated from a digital photographic camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In addition, a comparative study with 11 vegetation indices was carried out. The vegetation indices CIVE and EXG presented a better performance and the index WI presented the worst performance in the vegetation classification during the cycles of jack bean and millet, according to the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Vegetation indices were effective tools in obtaining soil cover index when compared to the standard Stocking method, except for the index WI. Architecture and cycle of millet and jack bean influenced the behavior of the studied vegetation indices. Vegetation indices generated from RGB images obtained by UAV were more practical and efficient, allowing a more frequent monitoring and in a wider area during the crop cycle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32099/24985,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Production of sugarcane seedlings pre-sprouted in commercial and alternative substrates with by-products of the sugarcane industry,"The sugarcane agro-industry is a major producer of organic waste, which could be used as substrates for production of pre-sprouted sugarcane seedlings aiming at reducing production costs and the sustainability of the sugar and alcohol industry. This study aimed to identify the best position of origin of the bud chip (little portion of stem with one bud) for the production of pre-sprouted seedlings (PSS) of sugarcane and the effects of commercial and alternative substrates containing by-products of the sugarcane industry on the production of sugarcane PSS. For this, a 4x2 factorial experiment was performed with four substrates: two commercial (TRIMIX® and BIOPLANT®) and two substrates formulated from sugarcane bagasse and filter cake (SABAFI and SUSBAFI) combined with bud chip from the basal and apical regions. The chemical and physical-hydric properties of the substrates and the development of PSS were evaluated. The substrates evaluated provided contrasting environments for root growth in relation to the physical-hydric and chemical properties. The use of by-products from the sugarcane industry can be added to the formulation of substrates for the production of pre-sprouted sugarcane seedlings, although the commercial substrate TRIMIX® provides superior performance to the seedlings, regardless of the origin position of the bud chip.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32040/24984,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Intermittent elimination of Porcine Parvovirus 4 (PPV4) in naturally infected swine semen: first report,"Porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4) has been reported in several countries and the high rate of concurrent PCV2 infection with PPV4 may trigger the “porcine circovirus disease” (PCVD). This has awakened the interest in how PPV4 virus behaves. The aim of this study was to show that, like other swine viruses, the elimination of PPV4 in semen is intermittent. The study was conducted in the Unidade de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento de Itapeva da Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios Regional (Apta Regional). Over a period of six months, four boars were monitored and the semen was collected every 10 days, totalizing 74 semen samples. Through PCR testing, PPV4 was detected in 32/74 (43.2%) semen samples. Three sequences of 284 nt, showed identity varying from 98.2% to 100%, confirming the detection of the virus in all boars. Semen volume and sperm motility did not indicate significant difference between PPV4 positive or negative semen samples (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the monthly distributions of positive and negative samples. This is the first study showing intermittent shedding of PPV4 in naturally infected boars. Absence of typical clinical signs and/or influence in semen quantity was also observed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29867/24308,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Indolebutyric acid on rooting of peach hardwood cuttings,"In the search for more efficient techniques for the propagation of peach cuttings, this study aimed to evaluate the rooting of hardwood cuttings of peach rootstock genotypes under different indolebutyric acid (IBA) concentrations. In the winter of 2016, the basal end of cuttings of genotypes 1701-1, 1701-2, 102-1, 102-2, 202-1 and 'Okinawa' were dipped into solutions with five concentrations of IBA (0, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 mg mg L-1) for 5 seconds. The cuttings were then placed in sand in plastic trays and kept in a mist chamber. The experiment was arranged in a 6x5 factorial, completely randomized design, with 5 replications, and each plot consisted of eight cuttings. After 59 days, the variables related to rooting and root quality were evaluated. Genotypes 102-1 and 202-1 showed high adventitious rooting potential in hardwood cuttings, with 76.8 and 66.5% of rooting, respectively. The concentration of 2000 mg.L-1 of IBA acid can be recommended for the treatment of hardwood cuttings of the tested rootstocks for propagation in the winter.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31119/24269,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Locally adapted brazilian sheep: a model of adaptation to Semiarid region,"Well adapted animals are characterized by maintain homeostasis under natural conditions. The present study aimed to evaluate physiological and morphological responses, as well as identify the relationship between these parameters in order to maintain homoeothermic status, in the dry and rainy season. Measurements were taken from 383 Morada Nova hair ewes, under dry and rainy season. The studied variables included rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), coat thickness (CT), hair length (HL), hair diameter (HD) and hair density (D). Blood samples were collected for determining biochemical, erythrogam and hormone concentration. The evaluated blood parameters from the Morada Nova breed did not demonstrate any variation from the reference interval established for sheep, confirming its adaptability profile even under high radiation and air temperatures. Multivariate analyses were performed in order to determine relationship between morphological, biochemical, erythrocyte and hormonal traits in each season. Differences correlations were observed according to season of the year. In the dry season, the correlations were significant among RT, RR, Packed cell volume (PCV), thyroxine (T4), Glucose (GLU), CT, HL, Globulin (GLO) and Total Protein (TP), whereas in dry season the characteristics that showed greater correlation were Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), thyroid hormones, Creatinine, GLO, TP, PCV and GLU. In conclusion, Morada Nova ewes was able to maintain homeothermy, even in the most stressful environmental conditions. Their hematological, biochemical and hormonal profile were within the normal range for sheep, confirming the adaptability of this local breed to the Brazilian semiarid environment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32774/24268,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Chemical, physical and mineralogical attributes of the soils of the Sertanejo pediplain in the sisal-growing areas of the semiarid Bahia","Information and available knowledge of the soils of the Sertanejo pediplain are relatively scarce and restricted to survey data. Researches about soil characterization and classification contributes to the knowledge of different soil orders within a region and allows information to be obtained systemically based on the physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of the soil. This study aimed to evaluate the genesis of the Sertanejo pediplain soils, through the characterization of the chemical and mineralogical properties and classification of the soils of the sisal-growing region. Five soil profiles located in Araci, Retirolândia, St. Dominic, and Valente, cities located in the sisal-growing areas of the Bahia semiarid region, were studied, described morphologically, and analyzed for chemical (pH H2O and KCl, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Al3+, H+ + Al3+, P, and TOC) and mineralogical attributes. Most evaluated soil classes were formed by lithological discontinuity of material. The main processes involved in the formation of such soil classes were: cumulization, accretion, and lessivage. The mineralogy of the clay fraction observed was complex and included a variety of minerals, with a predominance of kaolinite and bayerite. In addition, we also found goethite and illite in most of the studied profiles, both in the sediment, horizons P1 C2, and in the crystalline horizon P1 Cr, P2 Bi, P3 2Cr, and P5 Bi. The soils were classified up to the fourth category level, as Entisol Eutrophic Inceptisol (RRE), Alfisols Haplic typical Eutrophic (SXE), and Inceptisols Ta Eutrophic vertissólico (CXve).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32007/24983,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Feeding behavior and physiological parameters of rearing goats fed diets containing detoxified castor cake,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of replacing soybean meal (SM) with castor bean cake (DCC), detoxified using two alkaline products, on the feeding behavior and physiological parameters of Saanen and Anglo-Nubian goat breeds with an initial body weight of 16.22 ± 0.67 kg. The treatments consisted of three diets that were isoproteic and isoenergetic: the first with a standard formulation based on corn and SM, the second with DCC detoxified using calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 DCC), and the third with DCC detoxified using sodium hydroxide (NaOH DCC). A completely randomized design with a 3 × 2 (diets and breeds) factorial arrangement and four replicates per combination was used. A dietary effect on the intake of dry matter (DM) and NDFap (P = 0.02 and 0.01) was observed, with lower values for goats fed NaOH DCC than the other diets. The diets influenced feeding and rumination times (P = 0.04 and 0.03). An interaction (P = 0.04 and 0.01) between the breeds and the SM-based diet was found for time variables (other activity and idle time). Increased feeding and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) rumination efficiencies were observed for goats fed SM and Ca(OH)2 DCC (P = 0.03 and 0.01). Goats fed the NaOH DCC diet consumed large amounts of water, while Saanen goats urinated more times than did Anglo-Nubian goats. The diets had an effect on the heart rate and rectal temperature (P = 0.01 and 0.02), while the body surface temperature was influenced by the breed. Thus, Ca(OH)2 or NaOH DCC has a great potential to replace SM in the feeding of dairy goats. When used as diet for goats in the growth phase, NaOH DCC causes a reduction of DM and NDF intakes. Neither DCC negatively affected the physiological parameters of goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32648/24267,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Characterization of family-owned dairy farms in the western amazon,"More than half of the milk in Brazil comes from family-owned dairy farms, which account for 84.4% of all dairy farms. Despite this, little is known about family-owned dairy farms, especially those in the western Amazon. As such, the objective of this study was to analyze and characterize the production, sanitary conditions, reproductive rates, and milk quantities produced on 100 family dairy farms in Vale do Acre, in the western Amazon. The data were collected from March to June 2016, using a semi-structured questionnaire containing 549 questions. The answers given by producers, as well as local observations were registered in SPSS® spreadsheets, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Results indicated low rates of productivity, low total milk production, and low quantities of milk/cow/day. The data also revealed sanitary and productive problems such as inadequate herd composition, lack of grouping of lactating cows, and short duration of lactation. In addition, not all heifers were immunized against brucellosis, and there was often an absence of water troughs. We concluded that it is necessary to improve the management of family-owned farms, and take technical assistance measures to correct weak points in dairy cow health and reproduction. Moreover, it is essential to improve productivity to raise the profitability of rural dairy farms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32167/24266,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Agronomic and nutritional responses of Carajas elephant grass fertilized with protected and non-protected urea,"The objective of this study was to assess the agronomic and nutritional responses of the elephant grass cultivar Carajas when subjected to fertilization with protected and conventional urea. A randomized block design with 4×2+1 factorial arrangement was adopted. The treatments consisted of four doses (100, 200, 400, and 800 kg N ha-1), two nitrogen sources (conventional and protected urea), and one additional treatment without fertilization. The experiment was carried out from October 2015 to March 2016, in a semi-arid region with a dystrophic yellow latosol type soil. The application of conventional urea was done with each of the multiple cuts performed per year, whereas the protected urea was applied in a single dose. Total senescence rate (TSR), leaf and stem elongation, height, tiller density, total forage biomass, green leaf and stem biomass, and dry matter all increased with increasing N doses. However, the phyllochron, live material/dead material ratio, and agronomic efficiency all decreased with N increasing dose. Plants fertilized with protected urea presented greater TSR and phyllochron. Mineral matter content was higher in plants fertilized with conventional urea. Neutral detergent fiber content was maximized at a dose of 437.63 kg N ha-1. The protected urea resulted in a higher value of leaf/stem ratio at the 400 kg N ha-1 dose, whereas ether extract and crude protein at the 800 kg N ha-1. With application of conventional urea, the highest crude protein value occurred at a dose of 100 kg N ha-1. The morphogenesis, structure, production, and chemical composition of elephant grass ‘Carajas’ were all positively influenced when nitrogen doses were increased, with the recommended optimal dose for use being 400 kg N ha-1 for both sources. The use of protected urea is recommended because of its slow release and need for only a single application.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31333/24262,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol from Solanum glaucophyllum supports normal growth and reduces the negative effects of calcium and phosphorus restriction on broilers’ bone tissue","Feed supplementation with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3) has been studied as a means to decrease the incidence of bone abnormalities in broilers and reduce dietary inclusion of calcium and phosphorus. The objective of this research was to determine the optimal level of feed supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3 from Solanum glaucophyllum for growing broilers restricted in calcium and available phosphorus. A total of 648 day-old male chicks were distributed in a completely randomized design with six dietary treatments and six replications of 18 birds. Treatments consisted of one positive control (PC: corn-soybean-meal diet formulated to reach or exceed Rostagno et al. (2011) nutritional recommendations), one negative control (NC: PC diet with 15% reduction of calcium and available phosphorus), and four NC diets supplemented with 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 µg kg-1 of 1,25(OH)2D3. Performance and bone development characteristics were evaluated at days 21 and 33. Negative control did not modify broilers’ performance in comparison with PC, but birds fed with NC plus 1.0 µg kg-1 of 1,25(OH)2D3 showed higher (p = 0.01) daily weight gain than PC at day 21. Negative control reduced (p < 0.01) tibia weight, ash, breaking strength, and Seedor index at day 21, but supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3 mitigated all these negative effects. A quadratic effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 level was found for daily weight gain (p = 0.03), tibia weight (p < 0.01), breaking strength (p < 0.01), and Seedor index (p < 0.01) at this age. At day 33, NC broilers still had lower tibia weight (p = 0.01), ash (p < 0.01), and Seedor index (p < 0.01) than those fed PC. Only tibia ash did not return to the same value as that observed in PC after NC supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3. A quadratic effect (p < 0.01) of 1,25(OH)2D3 level was found for tibia ash and Seedor index at this age. On average, dietary supplementation of 1.15 µg kg-1 of 1,25(OH)2D3 was identified as the optimal level for bone characteristics in this trial. For performance, this level was 0.98 µg kg-1. In conclusion, feed supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3 from standardized leaves of Solanum glaucophyllum sustains normal growth and reduces the negative effects of calcium and phosphorus restriction on broilers’ bone tissue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31900/24264,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Crude glycerin as an alternative to corn as a supplement for beef cattle grazing in pasture during the dry season,"Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of inclusion of crude glycerin (CG) in the supplement (0, 70, 140, 210, and 280 g kg-1 dry matter (DM) of supplement) of Nellore cattle grazing tropical grasses during dry season. In Experiment 1, intake, digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and the rumen microbial profile were evaluated in two simultaneous 5 × 5 Latin squares, using 10 ruminally cannulated Nellore steers (408.8 ± 38.5 kg of body weight (BW)). In Experiment 2, cattle growth performance was evaluated in 50 young Nellore bulls (279.52 ± 16.3 kg of BW) distributed in a randomized complete block design. The increasing inclusion of CG did not affect intake ( P= 0.813), diet digestibility (P = 0.895), however linearly increased pH (P = 0.001), butyrate concentration (P < 0.001) and Fibrobacter succinogenes (P = 0.003) population. CG inclusion linearly decreased total ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA) (P < 0.001), acetate concentration (P < 0.001) and quadratically affected (P = 0.009) acetate: propionate ratio. In experiment 2, the inclusion of CG quadratically affected DM intake (DMI) (P = 0.005), DM total-tract apparent digestibility (P < 0.001), linearly increased additional gain (P > 0.001), average daily gain (P > 0.001) and feed efficiency (P > 0.001). CG in the supplement of Nellore steers grazing tropical grass during dry season doesn’t affect intake and digestibility but alters ruminal fermentation, without negative effect on relative proportion of cellulolytic bacteria population. The increasing replacement of corn grain by CG in the supplement of pasture-raised growing Nellore bulls (up to 280g/kg DM) improved BW gain and consequently feed efficiency.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32019/24265,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Feeding behavior of Nellore heifers grazing during the dry season of the year supplemented with mineral salt and urea types,"In this study, the feeding behavior of Nellore heifers receiving supplements containing mineral salt, conventional urea and slow release urea during the grazing stage at Brachiaria brizantha-based pastures during the dry period of the year was evaluated. Fifty-six heifers with approximately 284.72 ± 27.48 kg of body weight were used, distributed in a completely randomized design with four different treatment types: mineral salt; Urea - supplementation with 8.18% conventional urea; Mixed urea - supplementation with 4.09% conventional urea and 4.39% slow release urea and slow urea - supplementation with 8.78% slow release urea. Animals supplemented with mineral salt had longer grazing times compared to those supplemented with mixed urea, slow urea and regular urea. The dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber and total digestible nutrients presented a similar effect, with higher values for heifers consuming supplements containing regular urea and slow urea compared to those of mixed urea. However, when the efficiency of hourly intake was evaluated, the animals that received urea supplement were more efficient in relation to the other treatments. The number of grazing periods for heifers receiving slow urea supplementation was higher compared to heifers receiving salt and mixed urea. The duration of grazing and rumination periods was longer for heifers receiving salt supplementation and mixed urea than those receiving regular urea and slow urea. It is recommended to use supplements at the level of 0.3% of body weight for heifers receiving conventional urea.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31660/24263,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Threonine to lysine ratio in diets of tambaqui juveniles (Colossoma macropomum),"The objective of this study was to determine the optimal digestible threonine to lysine ratios in diets of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) juveniles. Five-hundred fish with a mean ± SE initial weight of 2.16 ± 0.03 g were used in a completely randomized design, consisting of four treatments, five replicates per treatment, and 25 fish per experimental unit. The treatments consisted of four isoenergetic, isophosphoric, isocalcic, and isolisinic (1.45%) diets, consisting of a basal diet supplemented with four L-threonine levels (1.013, 1.085, 1.158, and 1.230%), resulting in different threonine to lysine ratios (70, 75, 80, and 85%). Fish were maintained in twenty 500-L aquaria with independent water supply, drainage, and aeration systems, and were fed to apparent satiation six times a day for 45 days. Performance, feed efficiency, daily protein and fat deposition, body moisture content, and nitrogen retention efficiency of fish were evaluated. The digestible threonine intake increased linearly, and the efficiency of threonine for weight gain decreased quadratically, with increasing digestible threonine to lysine ratios. Weight gain, specific growth rate, feed:gain ratio, protein efficiency for weight gain, and nitrogen retention efficiency of fish increased in a quadratic manner with increasing digestible threonine to lysine ratios up to the levels of 75.96, 76.06, 76.36, 76.47, and 74.02%, respectively. It was concluded that the digestible threonine to lysine ratio for use in diets of juvenile tambaqui to achieve optimal performance and nitrogen retention efficiency is 76 and 74%, respectively, which corresponds to a digestible threonine level of 1.102 and 1.073%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31222/24261,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Phosphorus requirements of tambaqui juveniles,"The aim of this study was to determine the requirement of digestible phosphorus in diets for juvenile tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). 300 juveniles (26.4 ± 0.68 g) were used in a completely randomized design, consisting of six treatments with five replicates and 10 fish per experimental unit. The treatments consisted of six isoprotein, isonitrogenous, and isocalcium rations, with different levels of digestible phosphorus: 0.27; 0.46; 0.67; 0.91; 1.04; and 1.14%. The fish were kept in 30 polyethylene tanks (500 L) with a closed water circulation system and fed six meals per day for 49 days. Parameters of performance and feed efficiency, daily protein, and fat, ash, and phosphorus deposition rates were evaluated. The elevation of digestible phosphorus provided a quadratic increase in feed consumption to a level of 0.92%, linear increase in the consumption of digestible phosphorus, and quadratic reduction in the efficiency of digestible phosphorus for weight gain. The linear response plateau model was the best fit for weight gain and specific growth rate, estimated at 0.55% and 0.56% digestible phosphorus, respectively. The feed conversion and protein efficiency for weight gain improved quadratically up to an estimated level of 0.84% of digestible phosphorus. Body fat deposition improved quadratically up to an estimated level of 0.90% of digestible phosphorus. The linear response plateau model was the best fit for body deposition of protein, ash, and phosphorus, estimated at 0.55%, 0.46%, and 0.59% of digestible phosphorus, respectively. To optimize weight gain, the recommended level of digestible phosphorus in diets for juvenile tambaqui is 0.55%, which corresponds to an estimated level of 0.87% of total phosphorus.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31103/24259,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Lysine requirement for tambaqui juveniles,"The aim of this study was to determine the requirement for lysine in the diet of juvenile tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). In total, 750 juvenile fish (0.34 ± 0.02g) were distributed in tanks arranged in a randomized block design with six treatments, five replications in two blocks, and 25 fish per unit, for 50 d. Six levels of digestible lysine were tested (1.30, 1.48, 1.66, 1.84, 2.02, and 2.20%), in formulated diets based on the ideal protein concept. The performance, feed efficiency, daily deposition of protein and body fat, and nitrogen retention efficiency of the fish were evaluated. The consumption of rations and protein, specific growth rate, body composition, and deposition of body fat were not influenced by the lysine levels tested. The consumption of digestible lysine increased linearly and the efficiency of digestible lysine for weight gain decreased linearly with the increase in lysine levels. The levels of digestible lysine that optimized weight gain and body protein deposition were estimated at 1.73 and 1.78%, respectively. The feed conversion and nitrogen retention efficiency were most improved at 1.66% and 1.84%, respectively. The recommended level of dietary lysine for providing better weight gain and body protein deposition in juvenile tambaqui is 1.78%, equivalent to 2.00% total lysine.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31128/24260,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Can ruminal inoculum from slaughtered cattle replace inoculum from cannulated cattle for feed evaluation research?,"The objective was to test the hypothesis that ruminal inoculum obtained from slaughtered cattle can replace inoculum from cannulated cattle in trials evaluating animal feedstuffs through in vitro gas production and digestibility. Five adult Holstein × Zebu steers with ruminal cannula were used to collect and compare rumen liquid from in vivo and slaughtered animals. In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD) and ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations did not differ between inoculum sources (slaughtered × cannulated) for all byproducts and levels tested. Total in vitro gas production in the ruminal inoculum of cannulated animals was greater (P < 0.001) than slaughtered cattle for different levels of licuri cake. However, the greatest total concentrations of in vitro gases for slaughtered animals were observed when evaluating different levels of crude glycerin (P < 0.001). No differences were observed for diets containing castor bean meal (P >0.05). Thus, the ruminal inoculum obtained from the ruminal contents of slaughtered cattle can replace the use of fistulated animals and is a viable alternative to digestibility analysis. This approach is ethically more correct because it alleviates the suffering of animals by avoiding an invasive procedure.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30629/24258,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Fermentation pattern of tropical grass haylage and digestibility compared to hay in equine diet,"Hay production is the most common form of forage conservation methods for horse feeding. However, haylage can be an alternative to hay. The present research assessed the nutritional value of Tifton-85 haylage by fermentation pattern, bromatological composition, and apparent digestibility compared to hay in the diet of Quarter Horse mares. Haylage was prepared with 700.0 g of dry matter (DM) kg-1 added with a biological inoculum and was assessed at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days of production. At 14 days, the protein content had decreased from 192.0 to 173.2 g kg-1 DM. The opposite was found for ammoniacal nitrogen, which rose from 0.61 to 1.14 g kg-1 DM of total nitrogen. No differences were found for the variables NDF, ADF, hemicellulose, pH, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, whose values were 734.3, 316.5 and 416.9 g kg-1 DM, pH 5.47 and 0.06, 0.003, 0.03 g kg-1 DM, respectively. Lactic acid contents were higher after 28 days of haylage production, reaching 2.39 g kg-1 DM at the last assessment. The contents of aflatoxins, fumonisin, and zearalenone in the plant were similar to those in the haylage at 0.95 µg kg-1, 0.60 mg kg-1, and 0.71 µg kg-1, respectively. The digestibility assay showed an increase in protein digestibility in the diet with haylage (675.1 g kg-1 DM) compared to hay (579.1 g kg-1 DM) of the same grass. Haylage can potentially be used to feed horses and its use is recommended starting at 28 days of production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30617/24312,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Profile of bovine-milk-producing farms in Rondon do Pará, state of Pará, Brazil","This study describes the bovine milk-producing farms of Rondon do Pará, state of Pará, with the aim of assisting institutional actions and public policies that support the development of the milk production chain. The data were collected from interviews, using questionnaires administered in 55 dairy farms, which together represent 43.3% of the herd of milking cows in the municipality. We collected information on producers, characteristics of the milk-producing farms, dairy exploitation, machines and equipment, facilities and improvements, herd health, milking practices, and herd management. The average age of the interviewees in Rondon do Pará was 57.41 years. The producers had low education levels, with a prevalence of incomplete elementary education. Manual milking was used in 98% of the farms. When it came to hygiene practices, less than 2% of the milkers washed their hands before milk collection, and only 10% cleaned the teats of the cows. Animals were fed almost exclusively on pasture in the rainy season, given that only 2% of the producers complemented the diet with forage. Dairy production involved low technological levels, as the mean productivity was 5.5 L cow -1 day -1. The adoption of technological innovations in herd management may enable the growth and development of the activity in the municipality, and may make producers aware of the principles of sustainability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29065/24256,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Production performance of crossbred dairy cows fed palm kernel cake in feedlots,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of inclusion of palm kernel cake in the diet on dietary intake and digestibility and performance of lactating crossbred cows. Twelve Holstein × Zebu crossbred cows were distributed in three 4 × 4 Latin squares with the following treatments: control (no inclusion of palm kernel cake in the diet); inclusion of 50 g of palm kernel cake kg-1 in the total dry matter, 100 g of palm kernel cake kg-1 in the total dry matter, and 150 g of palm kernel cake kg-1 in the total dry matter. There was no effect of palm kernel cake on the intakes of dry matter, corrected neutral detergent fiber, non-fibrous carbohydrates, and total digestible nutrients. The intakes of crude protein and ether extract increased linearly. Inclusion of palm kernel cake in the diet did not influence the digestibility coefficients of dry matter, protein, ether extract, and non-fibrous carbohydrates, or milk production, feed efficiency, and body weight change. Fat-corrected milk yield increased linearly with the addition of palm kernel cake. Inclusion of up to 150 g of palm kernel cake in diets did not influence the dietary intake and performance of lactating cows or the composition of their milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29059/24255,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Different corporal structures determining the effective production of Red Angus primiparous cows at 24 months of age,"The objective was to evaluate the production and efficiency of 24-month-old Red Angus primiparous cows of different weights at weaning and repetition of pregnancy. Before calving, the females were managed in natural prairies and fed sweet clover (Lotus corniculatus) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), with loads of 315 and 501 kg ha-1, respectively. Females were divided into groups according to the average birth weight into light 346.15 ± 3.39 kg; moderate 381.95 ± 2.99 kg; and heavy 412.63 ± 3.33 kg weights. The indicators evaluated were: primiparous weights and body conditions at calving and weaning, daily average and total gains, fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI), and accumulation. Calves at birth and weaning had their daily average and total weights evaluated. In terms of production, the daily average and total gains per pair and effective herd production (EHP) of the weight groups were measured. At weaning, morphometric measures, viz. croup height and thoracic perimeter had a linear relationship increasing with the weight at calving. In FTAI and cumulative pregnancy, the groups of light and moderate cows were more efficient than the heavy group cows, with values of 81.25%, 75.00%, and 55.56%, respectively. The EHP differed between the groups with values of 37.07 ± 1.71, 28.13 ± 1.50, and 19.99 ± 1.68 kg, for light, moderate, and heavy, respectively. Light cows were 31.8% and 85.4% higher in effective production than moderate and heavy cows, respectively. Knowledge of the production system is important for enhancing breeding efficiency. The improvement in productive performance is related to the adequacy of metrices used in the production system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28944/24254,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Production and quality of Tifton 85 pastures overseeded with black oat: effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on the bromatological quality, forage production, and botanical and structural composition of Tifton 85 (Cynodon sp.) pastures overseeded with black oat (Avena strigosa). Four treatments were evaluated in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme (irrigated and non-irrigated × fertilized and non-fertilized), with three replicates, in a completely randomized design. In irrigated paddocks, the irrigation system was activated when the soil matric potential reached a value equal to, or higher than, 10 kPa and 135 kg N ha-1 was applied to fertilized paddocks, divided into four applications. The forage mass pre- and post-grazing, total forage production, and the botanical, structural, and bromatological composition of the pastures were evaluated. No interaction was observed between the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization factors for any of the variables and no significant differences were observed in forage mass between pre- and post-grazing or in Tifton leaf and stem percentages. Nitrogen fertilization had a significant effect on forage production, which was 2626.41 kg dry matter (DM) ha-1 higher in fertilized pastures than in unfertilized pastures. In addition, fertilization resulted in a lower percentage of dead material (6.66%), higher percentage of oat leaves (30.84%), higher leaf:stem ratio (1:45), higher crude protein content (24.13%), lower levels of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (64.57%) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (32.86%), and higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (73.01%) than in unfertilized pastures. The use of irrigation did not influence total forage production, however, it resulted in pastures with lower NDF (65.97%) and ADF (33.54%), and higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (73.48%) than unirrigated pastures. Nitrogen fertilization produced improvements in pasture structure, associated with higher dry matter yield and bromatological quality, while irrigation only produced pastures with lower fiber content and greater digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28648/24252,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Resistance to monepantel in multiresistant gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep flocks in Rio Grande do Sul,"The excessive, indiscriminate, and continued use of anthelmintic drugs as control methods favors parasite resistance, and this phenomenon has been reported in Brazil and worldwide. The current status of parasite resistance to anthelmintic drugs in sheep flocks in Rio Grande do Sul was assessed by calculating the EPG count in the stool to estimate the prevalence of resistance to the anthelmintic drugs closantel, levamisole, fenbendazole, monepantel, and moxidectin in seven properties. The animals from each flock were randomly distributed in six groups according to the anthelminthic drug used, as follows: T1, levamisole; T2, fenbendazole; T3, monepantel; T4, moxidectin; T5, closantel; and T6, control. On day zero, fecal samples were collected, and each animal was treated with one anthelminthic drug. Fecal samples were collected again after 14 days to calculate the efficacy of each active principle. Coproculture was performed using a pool of fecal samples from each group on day 0 and 14 to identify the predominant genera and prevalence of helminths. The genera identified in the coprocultures were Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Oesophagostomum, and Teladorsagia. All flocks developed resistance to levamisole, fenbendazole, moxidectin, and closantel. Moreover, resistance to monepantel was found in four of the seven farms. These results demonstrate the critical situation of anthelmintic resistance in sheep flocks in Rio Grande do Sul and the need to adopt other integrated control measures in addition to anthelmintic treatment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31702/24251,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Prevalence of Tritrichomonas foetus and Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis among bulls slaughtered in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil","Bovine genital campylobacteriosis (BGC) and bovine genital trichomonosis (BGT) are globally widespread, predominantly sexually transmitted diseases that mainly affect herds in which natural mating takes place. Bulls serve as good epidemiological indicators for studying the causative agents of these diseases in cattle herds. The objective of the present work was to determine the prevalence of BGC and BGT among bulls sent to slaughterhouses in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Samples of preputial smegma from 200 sexually mature, non-castrated bulls of several ancestries were collected in 2013 from four regional slaughterhouses. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Tritrichomonas foetus, Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, and C. fetus subsp. venerealis. Isolation also was used aiming to diagnosis of BGT. All smegma samples were negative in culture for T. foetus. Molecular tests revealed 8% (16/200) of animals to be positive for T. foetus, 17.5% (35/200) for Campylobacter. fetus subsp. fetus, and 13.5% (27/200) for C. fetus subsp. venerealis. The results of the present study indicate that T. foetus, C. fetus subsp. venerealis, and C. fetus subsp. fetus are present among bulls slaughtered in southern Minas Gerais, and that BGC and BGT occur in this region. These diseases therefore need to be considered during differential diagnosis of reproductive diseases affecting cattle herds in which natural mating is employed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30772/24249,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Sustainability and typology of dairy production systems,"The objective of this study is to analyze the typology of dairy production systems (DPS) in Paraná, Brazil, based on sustainable practices adopted by agricultural producers. A total of 153 semi-structured questionnaires containing variables for general characterization of DPS, socioeconomic characteristics of farmers, as well as environmental, social, and economic sustainability actions implemented by rural workers were applied. Common factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate sustainability variables. Three factors were created: economic (F1), social (F2), and environmental (F3). Hierarchical clusters were formed using the factor scores obtained in CFA. Three clusters were defined and were compared with F1, F2, and F3. There were significant differences in F1 and F2 between clusters 1, 2, and 3. Cluster 1 contained DPS highly compliant with economic, social, and environmental sustainability practices. Cluster 2 was defined by DPS with negative mean values for all three factors. Cluster 3 contained DPS that were highly compliant with F1 and F2 activities compared to cluster 2 and poorly compliant with F1 and F2 actions compared to cluster 1. Therefore, the DPS in Paraná vary according to the sustainable activities implemented by farm managers. In addition, most analyzed DPS have low survival capacity in the medium- and long-term. The most critical sustainability factor was F3, followed by F2 and F1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28878/24253,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Spoilage potential of spore-forming bacteria from refrigerated raw milk,"Aerobic bacterial spores are an important group of microorganisms in raw milk. These microbes are thermoduric, whereas the vegetative forms are thermophilic, thermoduric and psychrotrophic and reduce the shelf life of pasteurized milk. In Brazil, there are a lack of studies on the load of aerobic spores in raw milk; thus, little is known about the spoilage activity of these organisms. The aim the present study was to quantify the aerobic spores in Brazilian refrigerated raw milk of dairy region of Castro, Paraná state, assess the potential proteolytic and/or lipolytic isolates and identify the microorganisms derived from the germination. Twenty milk samples were evaluated, and the aerobic spore count was performed after plating the samples following heat treatment at 80°C for 12 min. The activity proteolytic and lipolytic isolates were evaluated through subculture on milk agar and tributyrin agar, respectively, and these microorganisms were identified using partial 16S rRNA gene sequences that were compared through GenBank. The aerobic spore counts ranged from 1 to 3.7 log CFU.mL-1, with a mean of 1.75 (± 0.59) log CFU.mL-1. After spore germination, 137 aerobic bacterial isolates were obtained, 40 of which (29.2%) showed milk spoilage activity. Among these, 31 isolates (77.5%) were proteolytic and lipolytic, seven isolates (17.5%) were exclusively lipolytic and two isolates (5%) were only proteolytic. Based on the 16S rRNA gene analysis, Bacillus licheniformis (55%), Bacillus spp. (27.5%), Paenibacillus spp. (7.5%), Bacillus pumilus (5%), Bacillus circulans (2.5%) and Brevibacillus spp. (2.5%) were identified. Studies of Brazilian raw milk microbiota have not yet described B. circulans which are frequently detected in milk from other countries. Among the 22 B. licheniformis isolates, 21 microbes (95.5%) showed proteolytic and lipolytic activity, and one isolate (4.5%) exhibited only proteolytic activity. The two B. pumilus isolates were proteolytic and lipolytic, whereas the B. circulans isolate was only lipolytic. Among the 11 Bacillus spp. isolates, eight isolates (72.7%) were proteolytic and lipolytic, one isolate (9.1%) was proteolytic and the other two isolates (18.2%) were lipolytic. The three Paenibacillus spp. and Brevibacillus spp. isolates were primarily lipolytic. Therefore, to extend the shelf life of pasteurized milk, preventive measures must be adopted to reduce contamination with spores because one-third of these microorganisms exhibited proteolytic and/or lipolytic activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31310/24250,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Risk factors associated with the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii in cattle and buffaloes in the state of Pará, Brazil","Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that parasitizes several hosts worldwide, of which cats are definitive hosts. The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk factors associated with the epidemiology of T. gondii in cattle and buffaloes in the state of Pará, Brazil. A total of 2,070 bovine samples (1,749 cattle and 321 buffaloes) were evaluated in 100 rural properties distributed in 51 municipalities from all mesoregions of the state. The evaluated risk factors were animal gender, type of farm, and number of cats in the properties. The serological prevalence of T. gondii was evaluated using the indirect enzyme immunoadsorption assay (iELISA). The samples with a sample/positive (S/P) ratio ? 0.5 were considered positive and analyzed using the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The samples diluted at 1:64 were considered positive. The chi-square test with a level of significance of 5% and the odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95% was applied.The data were analyzed using BioEstat software version 5.0.The prevalence of T. gondii in bovines was 35.79% and 45.12% in ELISA and IFAT, respectively. The prevalence was 34.48% and 44.14% in cattle and 42.99% and 50.47% in buffaloes using ELISA and IFA, respectively. The mesoregion with the highest prevalence of infection was Marajó Island, corresponding to 42.86% (129) and 50.5% (152) in ELISA and IFA, respectively. In buffaloes, the prevalence of T. gondiiusing ELISA was higher in males (p < 0.05) in the two age groups. In contrast, the prevalence of T. gondii using IFA was higher in males in the age group 13 to 24 months (p < 0.05). The type of farm did not affect the prevalence of T. gondii in cattle (p > 0.05). However, the presence of cats strongly affected the occurrence of infection in cattle. These results demonstrate the high levels of anti-T. gondii antibodies in cattle and buffaloes in Pará and this may be a public health problem. Furthermore, the presence of cats is a risk factor for infection with T. gondii in these species in Pará.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30652/24248,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Ovarian fragments were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde for 18 h (fresh control), stored in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) or in A. cearensis extract (0.1; 0.2 or 0.4 mg/mL) at a temperature of 4ºC for 6, 12 or 24 h (preservation - experiment 1) or cultured for 7 days in ?-MEM+ or in A. cearensis extract without (0.1; 0.2 or 0.4 mg/mL) or with supplements (0.1+ ; 0.2+ or 0.4+ mg/ mL; experiment 2). The percentages of morphologically normal follicles and follicular activation were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey´s test. The values of TUNEL-positive cells were submitted to Chi-square test (P < 0.05). The storage of fragments for 6 h in MEM showed higher percentages of normal follicles (62%) and a lower rate of TUNEL positive cells (36.17%) compared to other treatments (normal follicles: 46%; 43% and 52%; TUNEL positive cells: 58.57%; 55.30% and 55.63% for Amb 0.1; Amb 0.2 and Amb 0.4 mg/mL, respectively). However, after 12 or 24 h, MEM (12 h: 48%; 24 h: 45%) and Amb 0.2 mg/mL (12 h: 37%; 24 h: 39%) showed similar percentages of normal follicles and TUNEL positive cells (MEM - 12 h: 43.26%; 24 h: 58%; Amb 0.2 mg/mL - 12 h: 50%; 24 h: 61%). After culture, ?-MEM+ recorded a higher percentage of normal follicles (58.25%) than A. cearensis treatments (32.8%; 25.4% and 34.2% for Amb 0.1; Amb 0.2 and Amb 0.4 mg/mL, and 22.25%; 20.0% and 36.6% for Amb 0.1+ ; Amb 0.2+ and Amb 0.4+ mg/mL, respectively) (P < 0.05). Follicular activation increased in all treatments (52.5%; 36.73%; 54.05%; 47.5% and 58.19% for ?-MEM+ ; Amb 0.1; Amb 0.1+ ; Amb 0.2+ and Amb 0.4+ mg/mL, respectively) compared to the fresh control (11.65%), except for Amb 0.2 mg/mL (23.69%) and Amb 0.4 mg/mL (28.85%) (P > 0.05). Moreover, after in vitro culture, A. cearensis at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL maintained the percentage of TUNEL positive cells (30.0%) in a way that is similar to that observed in the fresh control (22%) (P > 0.05). In conclusion, ovine preantral follicles can be preserved at 4°C in MEM for 6 h. For longer periods of preservation (24 h), MEM and 0.2 mg/mL A. cearensis are recommended. Moreover, after in vitro culture, A. cearensis extract (0.1 mg/mL) showed higher activation and lower DNA fragmentation in ovine preantral follicles.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30271/24246,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Seroepidemiological study of maedi-visna in sheep in Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, and Sergipe States","The production performance of a livestock herd can be compromised by various diseases. In sheep, maedi-visna (MV) infections, which have a chronic nature, are caused by a virus (maedi-visna virus (MVV)) belonging to the genus Lentivirus of the Retroviridae family. The infection can cause significant economic losses and has considerable health impacts on sheep breeding in production systems. Due to the importance of this disease in sheep flocks, the objective was to conduct a serosurvey of MVV in the states of Ceará (CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Paraíba (PB), and Sergipe (SE). A total of, 3332 serum samples were collected in the four states, 1011 in CE, 931 in RN, 459 in PB, and 931 in SE, with the number of samples proportional to the actual herd size of each state. The samples were analyzed using the agar gel microimmunodiffusion test (AGID). Reproducers were revaluated using western blotting (WB). In addition to this serological survey, we administered an investigative questionnaire to identify possible risk factors that facilitate the introduction and spread of diseases (location, category, sex, breed type, creation system, production, herd size, and association with goats). After analysis of the sera using the AGID test, there was zero prevalence. Revaluating breeders by WB revealed a 5.5% prevalence of MV in the four states studied, with prevalences for the states of CE, RN, Paraiba, and SE of 2.3% (2/88), 10.4% (8/77), 3.6% (1/28), and 4.7% (2/42), respectively, corresponding to 13 breeders containing antibodies to the virus. These findings emphasized that the choice of diagnostic tests is extremely important for the early detection of seropositive animals and thus the prevention of the spread of the virus among herds in the region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30447/24311,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Effect of the ethanolic extract of pequi (Caryocar brasiliense) peel on acute cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus),"This study evaluated the activity of the ethanolic extract of pequi peel (EEPP) and immunostaining with matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (TIMP1 and TIMP2) in the myocardium of rats subjected to acute cardiotoxicity using doxorubicin (DOX). Thirty Wistar rats (six groups of five animals) were used as follows: sham group (SG), water and saline; group G1, 16 mg/kg of DOX and 300 mg/kg of EEPP for 17 days; group G2, 16 mg/kg of DOX and 600 mg/kg of EEPP for 17 days; group G3, 16 mg/kg of DOX and 300 mg/kg of EEPP for 10 days; group G4, 16 mg/kg of DOX and 600 mg/kg of EEPP for 10 days; and control group (CG), 16 mg/kg of DOX. Three days after administering DOX (day 17), euthanasia was performed, and samples were collected for anatomopathological analysis. Myocyte vacuolar degeneration, cardiomyocyte disorganization and myofibrillar fragmentation, necrosis, mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, Anitschkow cells, fibrosis, congestion, and edema were observed in the hearts of DOX recipients. In G1 and G2, EEPP attenuated myocyte vacuolar degeneration whereas in G4, EEPP attenuated cardiomyocyte disorganization. The percentage of cells immunoreactive for TIMP1 was higher in G1. It was concluded that EEPP minimizes the deleterious effects of DOX on rat myocardium. Doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg for 17 days attenuate the vacuolar degeneration of myocytes. The dose of 600 mg/kg for 10 days reduced cardiomyocyte disorganization, and the dose of 300 mg/kg for 17 days increased TIMP1 expression in the myocardium of DOX-treated rats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27509/24309,E-ISSN 1679-0359

However, there is few studies regarding the physical and physicochemical characterization and on the compounds of functional interest in fruits of this species. In the context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the physical and physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of the xiquexique fruit from plants occurring in three municipalities of the state of Paraíba, Brazil. The pulp of fruits from the municipalities of Boqueirão and Solânea presented lower acidity content, with higher SS/AT ratio and may be more suitable for fresh consumption. Furthermore, fruits from these municipalities can be also attractive for processing once they had larger sizes. Fruits of xiquexique exhibited high contents of functional compounds such as phenolic and betalains, which provided high antioxidant activity, with potential for adding value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32060/24243,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study aimed to evaluate gas exchange and production of ‘Paluma’ guava cultivated with different levels of water salinity and N. The experiment was carried out in drainage lysimeters under field conditions in an experimental area of the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Campus of Pombal, PB, Brazil. The experimental design was randomized blocks, in a 5 × 4 factorial scheme, with five levels of water salinity – ECw (0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7 and 3.5 dS m-1) and four doses of N (70, 100, 130 and 160% of the recommendation) with three replicates. The dose relative to 100% corresponded to 541.1 mg of N dm-3 of soil. The following production components were evaluated: number of fruits, mean fruit weight, polar and equatorial diameter of fruits, and polar diameter/equatorial diameter ratio. In addition, the following physiological variables were evaluated at 180 days after fruit pruning: stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation rate, internal CO2 concentration and transpiration rate. CO2 assimilation and transpiration rate were used to calculate instantaneous water use efficiency. The interaction between water salinity and N doses did not cause significant effects on any variable studied. Irrigation water salinity above 0.3 dS m-1 hampered gas exchange at 180 days after fruit pruning and negatively affected production components.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31450/24310,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Concentration and periods of application of prohexadione calcium in the growth of strawberry seedlings,"For strawberry cultivation in Brazil, producers are dependent on imported seedlings. An alternative strategy to reduce this dependence is the use of seedlings obtained from nursery plants grown in a protected environment. However, as these seedlings are produced in the summer and planted at the end of this season or the spring of the following year, it is necessary to control growth to reduce the energy costs of the plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations and periods of application of proexadione calcium (ProCa) on growth control of strawberry seedlings. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with seedlings of the cultivars ‘Aromas’ and ‘Camarosa’, produced by rooting stolons and kept in polystyrene trays of 72 cells in a substrate of carbonized rice husk. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a 4 × 2 factorial scheme (4 concentrations of ProCa: 0, 100, 200, and 400 mg L-1 × 2 periods of application: at 20 and 30 days after the planting period of rooting stolon). Plant survival, crown diameter, petiole length, total leaf area, specific leaf area, chlorophyll concentration, and dry mass of the crown and shoot were evaluated. The application of ProCa at 20 days after the planting period of the rooting stolon at the concentrations of 200 and 400 mg L-1 favored the reduction of petiole length in plants of ‘Aromas’ strawberry and total leaf aerial in ‘Camarosa’ strawberry. The application of ProCa from the concentration of 100 mg L-1 reduced the vegetative growth of ‘Aromas’ and ‘Camarosa’ strawberry seedlings cultivated in substrate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31296/24240,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Microbiology quality, detection of enterotoxin genes and antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from milk and Coalho cheese","This study evaluated the microbiological quality of milk and Coalho cheese, the prevalence of enterotoxin genes, antimicrobial resistance and determined an inducible MLSB resistance phenotype by the D-test in strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from these products. Seventy samples of milk and Coalho cheese were analyzed. S. aureus strains were identified by biochemical tests. The presence of se genes (sea-see) was tested by polymerase chain reaction. The antimicrobial sensitivity of S. aureus strains was evaluated for 13 antimicrobial drugs using the disk diffusion technique and the double-disk diffusion test (D-test) was performed to determine inducible resistance to lincosamide phenotype. The amount of toxin sufficient to cause foodborne diseases is generally observed when Staphylococcus populations exceed 105 CFU mL-1 g-1. In this study, none of the milk samples analyzed showed these counts; however, 73.3% (22/30) of Coalho cheese samples exceeded this value. A total of 109 isolates were identified as S. aureus. The presence of enterotoxin genes was detected in 25.7% of these isolates and amplified only for the sec gene. Most of the isolates (78.5%) were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. The D test showed that 25.0% of erythromycin-resistant isolates had the constitutive resistance phenotype, and 3.8% had the inducible resistance phenotype to clindamycin. These results indicate that these dairy products represent a health risk since these bacteria can cause foodborne diseases or may be a possible route for the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31787/24313,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Biometric variables and photosynthetic pigments in tamarind seedlings irrigated with saline water and biofertilizers,"Saline level of water or soil beyond the limit tolerated by crops may impair morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes of plants in general, including tamarind. This problem requires the adoption of management and input techniques to reduce the degenerative effects of salts on plant species. In this sense, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of bovine biofertilizers on biometric variables and chlorophyll contents in tamarind seedlings irrigated with saline water. The experiment was conducted from October 2012 to January 2013, in Areia, PB, Brazil, in a randomized block design with four replications and five plants per plot in a 5 × 3 factorial scheme, consisting of electrical conductivity of water of 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 dS m?1 and soil without and with common and chemically enriched biofertilizers. Leaf area, shoot dry matter, and contents of chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids were assessed at 100 days after sowing. The increased water salinity reduced leaf area and seedling biomass formation, with a higher intensity in the soil without biofertilizer. The addition of biofertilizers allows the formation of tamarind seedlings irrigated with water of a salinity not tolerated by them when cultivated in the soil without the tested inputs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30751/24238,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Fractionation of heavy metals in yellow latosol cultivated with vegetables,"Sequential extraction or chemical fractionation of heavy metals allows inferences to be made about their origin, occurrence, bioavailability, toxic potential and environmental contamination. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the distribution of Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn among the different soil fractions and landscape compartments of a yellow latosol cultivated with vegetables. Soil samples were collected from five areas cultivated with tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mill.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and chard (Beta vulgaris L.) in different slope positions (upper, middle, lower), and four reference areas (native forest), at a depth of 0.00 - 0.20 m. Heavy metal levels were also assessed in water used to irrigate the crops and for human consumption by collecting 200 ml of water samples from reservoirs. The soil samples were sequentially fractionated to quantify the concentrations of adsorbed Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in the exchangeable (EF), organic matter (OF), amorphous and crystalline iron oxide fractions (AFeOx and CFeOx). Landscape position only interfered significantly in heavy metal adsorption in the soil for Cu and Ni associated with CFeOx and Zn bound to the EF in the farming areas. The highest Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn levels were found in the fractions with less stable chemical bonds (bound to organic matter), in addition to a strong affinity between Cu, Zn and Mn and the oxide fractions (AFeOx + CFeOx). The low affinity of Pb and Ni for the AFeOx and CFeOx fractions indicates greater contamination potential for the water reservoirs. In the short term, organic matter is the main source of remediation for heavy metal contamination in soil, making it important to adopt conservation practices aimed at reducing OM losses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31078/24239,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Development of pre-sprouted seedlings (PSS) of sugarcane under different amounts of filter cake and application modes,"The sugarcane pre-sprouted seedlings (PSS) system is a new multiplication technology that contributes to the rapid production of seedlings and is associated with a high standard of vegetal health, vigour and uniformity of planting, as well as a drastic reduction in the use of seedlings per area. Due to the high moisture required during the initial period of growth, the filter cake can be an ally in the development of this technology. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the development of sugarcane PSS, under different amounts of filter cake and application modes. The treatments included five doses of filter cake at 0, 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 t ha-1 and two forms of application: depth (0.30 m) and surface. Once formed, the sugarcane PPS were planted in Eutroferric Red Latosol, with due treatments. For aerial development analyses, leaf area, stem length and diameter and shoot dry mass were evaluated at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days after planting. The filter cake positively influenced the development of pre-sprouted seedlings, promoting greater leaf area and stalk diameter when applied on the surface. The dose of 30 t ha-1 to the surface, provided 54% higher shoot dry weight and 56% more dry weight of roots compared to cultivation without its application, demonstrating its usefulness to improve the development of pre-sprouted seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30587/24237,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Morphophysiology of guava cv. Paluma with water of different salt concentrations and proline doses,"Quantitative and qualitative limitations of water resources in Northeast Brazil, besides the excessive use of fertilizers without criteria related to soil analysis and crop needs, has called the attention for studies on techniques that allow saline waters to be used in agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate physiological and growth responses of grafted guava plants, cv. Paluma, as a function of irrigation with saline water and foliar applications of proline. The experiment was carried out in protected environment in Pombal – PB, Brazil, in a randomized block design in 4 x 4 factorial scheme, with three replicates, and treatments consisted of four levels of irrigation water electrical conductivity – ECw (0.3; 1.0; 1.7 and 2.4 dS m-1) associated with four doses of proline (0, 5, 10 and 15 mmol L-1). Grafted plants of guava cv. Paluma can be grown using water with ECw of 1.1 dS m-¹ since it led to acceptable mean reduction of 10% in growth and physiological activity. Mean proline dose of 8 mmol L-1 leads to increase in the number of leaves and dry matter accumulation. The interaction between proline doses and water salinity levels did not affect either growth or physiology of grafted plants of guava cv. Paluma, at 101 days after transplanting.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30343/24234,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Immunoexpression of cell cycle regulators in canine prostate with proliferative lesions,"Immunostaining of p21, p27, p53, cyclin D1, c-myc was evaluated in normal canine prostate and prostate with proliferative disorders to verify the interaction between these regulators of cell cycle progression. From 106 samples of canine prostate obtained from a TMA block, 15 were considered normal, 16 diagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 30 as proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), 20 as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and 25 as prostatic carcinoma (PC). There was positive correlation between p21 and p27 for number of stained cells and staining intensity in all conditions and between c-myc and p53 in prostates with PIN. Considering the number of labeled cells, there was positive correlation between p21 and p53 in the normal prostate. Relative to the intensity of staining, there was positive correlation between p21 and p53 in prostate tissue with PIN and between p27 and c-myc in prostates with PIA. A negative correlation between c-myc and cyclin D1 was also identified in the glands with PIN, considering the number of labeled cells, and between p27 and c-myc in the prostates with PC for staining intensity. In conclusion, the expression of p21, p27, p53, cyclin D1 and c-myc varies according to type of proliferative lesion in canine prostate. Taken together, the results indicate low growth potential of the canine PC in the presence of p21 and p27 overexpression, cyclin D1 low expression and regular expression of c-myc, even with the expression of p53 mutant type. Further, it was possible reaffirm the premalignant potential of PIA and PIN in canine prostate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27337/24001,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Development of 'Itália Melhorada' grapes on different rootstocks and under the semiarid conditions of the Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil","Our study was carried out in the region of Mossoró city, state of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil), in February 2013. This experiment aimed to describe the phenology, estimate biometeorological indexes, and perform a chemical characterization of 'Itália Melhorada' grapes (Vitis vinifera L) grafted on three different rootstocks (cultivars: IAC 313, IAC572, and IAC766), during two production cycles and under semiarid conditions. The first cycle lasted 115 days, with a pruning performed on 04/19/2013; yet the second lasted 111 days, with a pruning on 09/25/2013. In the first cycle, the thermal sum required was 1258.27 DD (degree days), while in the second, it was 1290.50 DD. The Heliothermic Geslin Index (HGI) observed in the first cycle was 352.84 and, in the second, it was 371.17. The rootstocks had no influence on the evaluated factors (phenology, TTA, TSS, and STT/ TTA) in either of the two cycles, therefore, all the tested rootstocks can be used indistinctly, but still, the analysis revealed differences from one cycle to another in terms of TSS and TSS / TTA of berries.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30319/24233,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Evaluation of a short-term ingestion of zearalenone, fumonisin, and aflatoxin mixture incorporated, at low concentration, into the diet of weanling piglets and the effect of an anti-mycotoxin feed additive","An experiment was conducted to evaluate the toxic effects of short-term ingestion of a zearalenone, fumonisin, and aflatoxin mixture, at low concentration, into the diet of weanling piglets and to assess the protective efficacy of an anti-mycotoxin feed additive. For 21 days, piglets were exposed to control or multi-mycotoxin treatment with or without the anti-mycotoxin additive. Growth performance was measured after 21d. Blood samples were taken to serum biochemical analysis and for quantify levels of circulating mononuclear immune cells. Effects on organs weights and histological changes, and expression levels of COX-2 and TNF-? in the liver and jejunum were evaluated. Overall, the multi-mycotoxin treatment had no effect on measured variables, and no adverse histopathological changes in organs were observed. The total serum protein concentration was higher in animals that received the multi-mycotoxin treatment; however, levels remained within normal limits for weanling piglets. In conclusion, the short-term multi-mycotoxin mixture, at the dose levels evaluated in this study, seems not affect the health of weanling piglets through the evaluated parameters. The absence of toxicity associated with the multi-mycotoxin treatment rendered it impossible to evaluate the efficacy of the anti-mycotoxin additive.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30840/24040,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Performance and digestive characteristics in dairy cattle maintained under grazing regime and supplemented with linseed,"Linseed is characterized by the rich unsaturated fatty acids and slow release of oil in the rumen. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the intake, rumen degradability, and digestibility of dairy cattle maintained under grazing regime and supplemented with linseed. Twelve Girolando (¾ Holstein × ¼ Gir) cows with a mean age of 5.2 ± 1.9 years and body weight of 583.9 ± 67.6 kg were used. The cows were maintained in a rotational grazing system on the mombaça grass (Panicum maximum) and divided into 2 experimental groups. The CONTR (n = 6) group received only the base diet (pasture) and the LINS group (n = 6) received pasture plus linseed. Initially, a fifteen-day adaptation period was established to stabilize the desired consumption amount. After this period, the animals received 800 g of linseed for 126 d. The ruminal degradability was evaluated using 2 males with a cannula in the rumen, and they were provided the same experimental diet. The measured dry matter production of pasture did not show differences during the experimental period. The intake of crude protein and ethereal extract was higher, whereas neutral detergent fiber content was lower in the cows supplemented with linseed. However, this did not alter the weight gain and digestibility coefficients, except the digestibility coefficient of the ethereal extract. At the ruminal level, linseed showed low effective and potential degradability with negative effect on grass degradability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30643/23999,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Ethanol extract of Nandina domestica Thunb. leafs: effect on Pomacea canaliculata and growth of Orzya sativa seedlings,"Alien species may adversely affect not only human health, agriculture, and fisheries but also the native ecosystem. Pomacea canaliculata is one of alien harmful species (IUCN). Forest residues are a kind of renewable, cheap and secure source of primary energy. Nandina domestica Thunb. is a commonly and widely cultivated plant for city landscape construction in China. After being pruned, a large of N. domestica leaves are usually abandoned. In this work, extracts of ethanol Soxhlet (SE), ethanol immerse (EE), and water immerse (WE) were obtained from leaves of N. domestica Thunb. cv. Firepower. The molluscicidal effects of the three extracts from the leaves were evaluated against black P. canaliculata. In sand pot culture condition and pot culture with paddy soil condition, SE at concentration of 4000 mg L-1 did not affect seedlings normal growth. Plant height, seedling fresh weight (SFW), seedling dry weight (SDW) and Chlorophyll content of SE (4000 mg L-1) were not significantly different from that in DS (distilled water + seedlings). Besides, in pot culture with paddy soil condition, the SE treatment at concentration of 4000 mg L-1 inhibited P. canaliculata chewing rice seedlings effectively, which was not statistically different from the positive control {NSP, niclosamide (according to field dosage, 0.086 g m-2 ) + seedlings + P. canaliculata)}. Results from this study indicated that SE has molluscicidal effect against P. canaliculata and SE did not affect the normal growth of rice seedlings. Thus, we suggest further chemical and toxicological studies of SE.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30585/24235,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Ruminal fermentation and degradation, kinetic flow of the digesta and milk fatty acid composition of cows fed chopped elephantgrass supplemented with soybean oil","The aim of this study was to evaluate the ruminal parameters of fermentation and degradation, kinetic flow of rumen digesta, and milk fatty acid composition of cows fed 52% chopped elephantgrass-based diets containing 0.0% (control), 1.5%, 3.0% and 4.5% soybean oil (SO) on a dry matter (DM) basis. Four rumen-cannulated Holstein x Gyr dairy cows with an average milk production of 15.6 ± 3.0 kg day-1 and 90 ± 25 days in milk were allocated in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The results were analyzed by mixed models. Significant differences were declared at P ? 0.05, and P-values from 0.05 < P ? 0.10 were considered as a trend. The inclusion of SO in the diet had no effect on the ruminal pH or total volatile fatty acid concentration, but there was a quadratic effect on the ruminal ammonia nitrogen content and a trend for a linear reduction (P = 0.07) in the molar proportion of rumen acetate. Linear reductions were also observed in the DM and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) effective degradabilities of elephantgrass forage, but the fluid and particulate passage rates in the rumen and the DM and NDF intakes were unchanged by SO inclusion in the diet. Milk production, protein and lactose contents and yields were unaltered by dietary SO levels. There were linear reductions in the milk fat and total solids contents, but there was no effect of dietary treatments on their yields. The inclusion of soybean oil in the diet of Holstein x Gyr cows fed chopped elephantgrass improved the nutritional quality of milk fat as a result of increased contents of oleic, rumenic and vaccenic acids, which are beneficial to human health, and a concomitant reduction in hypercholesterolemic saturated fatty acids such as lauric, myristic and palmitic acids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30525/23997,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effects of feeding systems and breed group on carcass characteristics and meat quality of feedlot goat kids,"The goal was to evaluate if feeding systems with or without milk or breed groups can improve carcass characteristics, the proportion of tissues and meat tenderness of feedlot goat kids. Were used 56 animals from five different breed groups fed by experimental diet and milk according to the treatment., without milk or with 1,5 L milk/animal/day. The kid goats were slaughtered at 30 kg of live weight, and the carcass conformation and amount of fat were determined subjectively by visual assessment. Morphometric measurements and carcass and cut yields were performed. The Longissimus lumborum muscle was separated to determinate the area and subsequently it was used to evaluate the tenderness of the meat. The feeding system changes goat carcass characteristics, and goat kids fed milk until slaughter have better carcass yield and meat quality, as it anticipates the deposition of total fat, which can benefit carcass quality, given the scarcity of fat in the carcass of goats. The breed group also influences carcass characteristics. It is recommended the use of the Boer breed up to 3/4, since more than that it reduces leg yield and does not improve the compactness index and carcass conformation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30517/24041,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Determining the optimal dose of virginiamycin for ruminal parameters and performance of Nellore cattle on pasture,"There are no studies evaluating the virginiamycin (VM) doses under tropical conditions. So, the present study was conducted to evaluate the optimal dose of VM for growing Nellore bulls on tropical pasture. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment, one hundred and two Nellore bulls (307 ± 25 kg body weight [BW]; 22 months) were used. Animal performance was evaluated using a randomized block design, with group as experimental unit (n = 8; 12 animals each). The second experiment, a double 4 × 4 Latin square, eight animals were used to evaluate the ruminal parameters. Four doses were evaluated: 0, 35, 55, and 75 mg VM per 100 kg BW. The average daily gain (P = 0.08) and carcass gain (P = 0.05) exhibited a trend of quadratic behavior. An increased dose of VM did not affect supplement intake (P = 0.64), rumen pH (P = 0.96), acetate: propionate ratio (P = 0.73), or the total concentration of volatile fatty acid (P = 0.63). The concentration of rumen ammonia nitrogen exhibited a quadratic effect (P = 0.01). A quadratic behavior was found for volatile fatty acid, except for propionate (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the dose of 47 mg VM per 100 kg BW is recommend for growing Nellore bulls on tropical pasture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30478/24038,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Biological efficiency of Charolais beef cows of different body sizes,"This study aimed to evaluate the production, reproductive performance, and productive efficiency of predominantly Charolais cows and their calves (Straightbred, ¾ C, ¼ N) according to body size at calving. Sixty-three cow-calf pairs were used and classified into three weight groups: Light (331.3±5.8 kg), Moderate (385.9±5.3 kg), and Heavy (424.4±6.2 kg). The classes were formed using half standard deviations above or below the average weight of the cows at calving. For each pair, the body weight was evaluated at calving, at weaning (63 days), at the beginning and at end of the reproductive period, and at 9 months for the calves. Pregnancy rates were similar (P > 0.05) between weight groups. The calves did not differ (P > 0.05) in terms of body weight and weight gain from calving until pregnancy diagnosis (210 days). The heavy cows had greater weight variations from 210 days to 270 days than the light cows. The calf production rate (kg calf/cow kept in herds) did not differ between weight groups. However, in relation to the weight of the cows at 210 days, light cows were 11.28% and 13.02% more productive (P < 0.05), than moderate and heavy cows, respectively. Light cows were more efficient than the other classes of cows at calving and at 210 days old. Our simulations showed that there were more kilograms for sale in herds of light cows (53.085 kg) than moderate and heavy cows (52.310 and 52.870 kg, respectively), while maintaining the structures of the herd constant. The size of the Charolais cow did not influence the weight of calves from calving until 7 months of age or their reproductive performance provided they were weaned early. The need for space for the maintenance of the cow-calf pair increased as the weight of the cows increased. In herds with smaller cows, higher numbers and a higher production of weight for sale are observed than in herds with moderate and heavy cows. Light cows were the most efficient at calving and during pregnancy diagnosis at 210 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30434/23994,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nutritional and metabolic parameters of sheep fed with extrused roughage in comparison with corn silage,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of extrused roughage on nutritional and metabolic parameters in sheep. Eighteen 3-year-old sheep in metabolic cages were randomly assigned to two treatments: corn silage and extruded roughage. Dry matter intake (DMI) and water intake were calculated as the difference between offered feed and orts left. Ruminal movement was assessed through auscultation of the rumen for five minutes, glycemia and other metabolites through blood collection by jugular venipuncture, and feeding behavior by observation every 5 minutes for 24 hours. DMI per animal, both as a percentage of live weight and in relation to metabolic weight, was higher for animals fed extrused roughage. The extrused roughage treatment also resulted in reduced ruminal movement and higher dry matter digestibility (DMD), glycemia and drinking water intake. Animals fed with extrused roughage reduced the time of rumination and total chewing, thus increasing ingestion, chewing and rumination efficiency. Blood concentrations of glucose and urea were higher in animals fed extrused roughage, while cholesterol concentration was lower. We conclude that the use of extrused roughage promotes improvement in the nutritional parameters of sheep by increasing DMI and DMD, and reducing chewing and rumination times, without causing disorders in energy and protein metabolism.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30539/23998,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effects of the inclusion of glycerin in diets containing 30 or 70% roughage on feed disappearance and digestibility,"The objective of this study was to evaluate in vitro nutrient disappearance and in vivo nutrient digestibility of cattle diets containing 70 or 30% roughage, with and without glycerin supplementation. Four Nellore cattle were used in the study based on a 4 × 4 Latin Square design in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Inclusion of glycerin and roughage proportion did not affect the nutrient disappearance of each ingredient (P > 0.05). Regardless of the inclusion of glycerin, a reduction in the proportion of roughage led to an increase (P < 0.05) in DMDis (64 vs. 72%), NDFDis (41 vs. 54%), and ADFDis (31 vs. 44%) of the total rations. Inclusion of glycerin resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in DMD (70 vs. 62%) and a reduction (P < 0.05) in CPD (32 vs. 38%) and STD (82 vs. 74%). The diet containing 30% roughage led to higher (P < 0.05) DMD (67 vs. 65%) and CPD (35 vs. 33%) in comparison with the 70% roughage diet, but did not differ (P > 0.05) in STD (78%). Inclusion of glycerin at 20% of the total DM increased the utilisation of dietary DM without affecting the fibrous fraction of the diet. Glycerin supplementation in diets containing 70% roughage improves neutral detergent fibre digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30338/23992,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Performance and carcass characteristics of feedlot-finished Zebu cattle in different feeding systems,"The performance and characteristics of 18 carcasses of feedlot-finished Zebu cattle were evaluated over 93 days in confinement or semi-confinement systems. In the semi-confinement system, two strategies of pasture deferral were adopted, 40 days (40DD) and 80 days (80DD). The feed of animals in confinement was composed of 24% of grass silage Urochloa spp. and 76% concentrate, on dry matter, freely supplied twice daily. Grazing animals received 4 kg of animal concentrate per day. The final fasting weight of the animals in confinement (534.92 kg) was higher than that of animals semi-confined in 40DD (475.33 kg) and 80DD (460.67 kg) pastures, because of the higher daily weight gain (1.37 vs. 0.82 and 0.64 kg, respectively). Feedlot-finished animals had a greater carcass gain (0.91 kg animal-1 day-1), resulting in a higher carcass weight (296.47 kg), higher thickness of external fat (5.42 mm), weight and percentage of side cut (17.88 kg and 12.20%), and weight and percentage of fat in the carcass (74.50 kg and 25.22%). However, no difference was observed for the metric and developmental characteristics of the carcass, which allowed good quality carcasses to be obtained, independent of the strategies evaluated. Feedlot-finished Zebu cattle provide heavier and bulky carcasses, leading to higher revenue per marketed carcass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30406/23993,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Dry brewery residue in broiler chickens feed,"The residual from the food industry has the potential to replace the traditional ingredients used in animal feed, and the dry brewery residue (DBR) may be an alternative for this purpose. This study aimed to evaluate the use of DBR in the diets of broiler from 22 to 42 days of age. Five hundred and forty-six male broilers were used, with an initial average weight of 865 ± 8 g. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design, with six levels of DBR inclusion (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%), seven replicates and thirteen animals per experimental unit (EU). Weight gain (WG), average feed intake (AFI) and feed:gain ratio were evaluated. At 42 days of age, blood samples were collected from two broilers of each EU, and one broiler per EU was slaughtered to investigate the intestinal development. DBR interposed the WG and promoted a linear effect in this variable from 22 to 42 days of age. This effect was not observed for AFI. The inclusion of DBR interfered with the serum cholesterol values, showing a quadratic influence at the maximum response for the inclusion of 4.96%. However, the blood parameters of triglycerides, uric acid, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and total protein remained unchanged, regardless of the level of dietary DBR. No changes in villus height and crypt depth were observed by intestinal morphometric evaluation. The inclusion of 10% DBR can be used in a poultry diet, without any damage to the performance, metabolism and development of the broilers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30183/23991,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Rice co-products in pig feed during the starter phase (15 to 30 kg),"This study was carried out to evaluate the inclusion of two rice co-products in pig feed during the starter phase in terms of the nutritional value and digestibility of the co-products, and the effect on plasma parameters, growth performance and economic viability. In Experiment I, a digestibility assay was performed using 30 barrows (14.4 ± 2.4 kg body weight), which were distributed in a completely randomised design. The co-products studied were broken rice (BR) and hominy rice 3/4 (HR) to replace the reference diet (300 g/kg). The estimated digestible energy (DE) and metabolisable energy (ME) were 3,476 and 3,360 kcal/kg for BR and 3,487 and 3,362 kcal/kg for HR, respectively. In Experiment II, 108 pigs (15.5 ± 1.0 to 30.1 ± 1.3 kg body weight) were used, distributed in a randomised block design with a factorial analysis scheme (2 × 4), using two types of rice and four inclusion levels (160, 320, 480, and 640 g/kg), with six replicates and two pigs per experimental unit. Additionally, a control diet was used with no inclusion of the co-product. The daily weight gain increased and the feed:gain (F:G) ratio decreased as HR content of feed increased. An effect of both types of rice on plasma glucose concentration was obtained, in which the pigs fed with BR showed the highest values. The cost of diet per kilogram of body weight gain increased as BR levels in the diet increased. It was observed that inclusion levels of 480 and 640 g/kg of BR differed from the control diet, showing the highest costs. HR and BR can be used in pig feed in the starter phase at up to 640 g/kg without impairing performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30148/23989,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Ingestive behavior and thermoregulation in sheep fed forage cactus silage undergoing intermittent water supply,"This study aimed to assess the effect of using forage cactus silage in the diet of sheep under intermittent water supply on its ingestive behavior and thermoregulation. We used in the experiment thirty-six intact male sheep of undefined genotype with an initial average weight of 19.8 ± 2.1 kg and age of approximately six months. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a 3 × 3 factorial scheme composed of three levels of forage cactus silage in the diet (0, 21, and 42%), three water supply periods (0, 24, and 48 hours), and four replications. For the ingestive behavior, observations were carried out every 5 minutes for 2 periods of 24 hours. Thermoregulatory responses were taken at 7:00 and 15:00 h on days other than those intended for ingestive behavior tests. Intermittent water supply did not affect any of the studied variables (P > 0.05). The use of forage cactus silage significantly influenced the ingestive behavior of animals (P < 0.05). Sheep fed forage cactus silage in the diet presented an average feeding efficiency of 255.77 g DM h?1 and an average rumination efficiency of 102.16 g DM h?1, while animals fed control diet showed values of 198.63 and 78.45 g DM h?1, respectively. Urinary frequency increased according to the levels of forage cactus silage in the diet, with 23.60 urination per day in animals fed diets with 42% of forage cactus silage and 10.83 urination per day in animals fed control diet. However, the search for water reduced, with averages of 2.73 and 0.54 per day for animals fed 0 and 42% forage cactus silage, respectively. The use of forage cactus silage also increased thermoregulatory responses of sheep, with an average respiratory rate of 103.35 mov. min?1 and heart rate of 140.08 mov. min?1 in the warmest period of the day (in the afternoon). Thus, sheep fed forage cactus silage increases its feeding and rumination efficiencies, decreases its search for water, and increases its thermoregulatory responses. The intermittent water supply within 48 hours does not influence the ingestive behavior and thermoregulation of confined sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29701/23988,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,In vitro gas production kinetics and digestibility in ruminant diets with different levels of cashew nut shell liquid,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing levels of cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) in ruminant diets on in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), gas production kinetics, ruminal fermentation parameters, ammoniacal nitrogen concentration (NH3-N), and pH of the artificial rumen contents. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 5 x 4 + 1 design, with five concentrate levels (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 g kg-1 DM) and four CNSL levels (0, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 g kg-1 DM), as well as a control diet comprising only whole-plant corn silage, totaling 21 treatments. The inclusion of concentrate linearly increased IVDMD, while CNSL levels showed a quadratic effect, with the maximum estimated at 0.5 g kg-1 of CNSL. The total gas production, the disappearance of the substrate, the fraction of slow degradation (fraction VF2), and the respective degradation rate (fraction µ2) linearly increased with increasing levels of concentrate in the diet. Increasing concentrate levels resulted in a linear increase in the concentration of NH3-N and a reduction in the pH of the rumen liquid. Increasing CNSL levels decreased the concentration of NH3-N and increased the ruminal pH. The inclusion of 0.5 g CNSL kg-1 in the ruminant diets improved IVDMD, without altering the kinetic parameters of ruminal fermentation. The addition of CNSL to ruminant diets reduces ammoniacal nitrogen production and can avoid drastic reductions in ruminal pH, favoring better fermentation in the rumen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29652/23987,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Characterization of the factors associated with the growth phase of dairy cattle in family farming,"The aim of this study was to characterize the factors associated with the growth phase of dairy cattle used in family farming. We investigated 20 family-run milk production systems located in the Conceição de Ipanema municipality, MG, Brazil. Farmers were interviewed using a semi-structured survey form containing 152 questions. The questions were aimed at characterizing the farmer, herd, and husbandry system at pre- and post-weaning phases. Data were processed by using Sphinx® software, and descriptive analyses were performed in MS Excel® software. The results showed strengths, including navel healing (100%), location of the calf housing above (45%) or next to the pen (35%), and existence of a sanitary calendar (90%). However, several limitations in the management of calves and heifers were identified, such as lack of zootechnical bookkeeping (55%), manual milking with calf at the foot (65%), absence of herd sizing (100%), no routine weighing of calves (95%), incorrect colostrum management (80%), non-supply of transition milk to calves (85%), and likely failure to diagnose diseases by a fraction of the farmers. Thus, training regarding adequate management practices by extension technicians is imperative, along with the formulation of public policies that comply with the aspirations of family farmers, while promoting their economic and social sustainability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29646/23986,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Characterization of silage production and the use by dairy farmers in the West of Santa Catarina state,"Silage has been widely used in dairy production. However, little is known about its use at production level. The goal of this study was to characterize production and usage of silage for the dairy farming in Western Santa Catarina state. Thirty farms were selected randomly by their geographical location, in 11 municipalities of the West of Santa Catarina state, and they were invited to participate in the research. Out of these 30 farms, 6 did not have any dairy activity, and 2 preferred not to participate in the research, thus were not included. Semi-structured interviews and on-site visits were then performed. All data were analyzed with the software R version 3.2.2. 95% of the farmers produced and fed silage to animals. Out of the 22 farmers participating in the study, 82% provided silage for dairy cows during the whole year; in 86% of these farms, the silage was fed right after milking, in an average amount of 6.06 ± 0.63 kg DM (dry matter) AU-1 (animal unit, 500 kg) day-1. The average area used for maize production was 8.46 ha, representing 59% of the area destined to dairy farming. The average silage production was 8.8 and 7.6 t ha-1 year-1 in the season and off-season crop respectively, without significant differences. In most silage production areas, the no-tillage system is adopted, with the use of pesticides, chemical fertilization and transgenic seeds, without soil covering or crop rotation. Farms that fertilized maize based on soil analysis had the greatest silage yield, compared to the ones that fertilized without relying on soil analysis. The use of different types of pesticides and fertilizer quantities was not correlated to the silage production volume. Overall the production systems and the quantity of silage produced and fed to the cows do not follow technical criteria; thus silage yield and use could be improved if following strategies to better allocate crop inputs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29253/23985,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Use of a colloid to optimize centrifugation in the selection of bovine sperm for IVF,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the force and duration of centrifugation and the impact of cushioned centrifugation on sperm selection by Percoll gradient, on sperm quality and development kinetics of in vitro produced bovine embryos. Two experiments were performed. In Experiment I, a pool of semen was selected by Percoll gradients and the pellet was divided into four groups and distributed in a 2 × 2 factorial, with two forces (2200 × g or 9000 × g) and two durations (1 min or 3 min) of centrifugation. In Experiment II, semen was divided into two groups and selected by Percoll gradient with Cushion Fluid (CF) or without CF (Control) in the second centrifugation. The morphofunctionality, biochemical characteristics and fertilizing capacity of the selected sperms were evaluated. In addition, the development of the resulting bovine embryos was monitored for 48 h post-insemination. Duncan and Chi-square tests (P < 0.05) were used to compare the means. In Experiment I, there was a significant increase in sperm vigor (P < 0.05) after sperm selection in all treatments. The force and duration of centrifugation did not have any effect on sperm motility, vigor, and recovery rate among the different treatments (P > 0.05). In Experiment II, the recovery rate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in semen were similar among treatments (P > 0.05) although a higher ROS production was observed in the CF fertilization medium. Total fertilization rate was superior in the CF group (65.4 ± 5.3%) compared to that in Control (39.6 ± 4.9%). However, the normal fertilization and cleavage rate did not differ between the Control (94 ± 6.3% and 58.3 ± 8.3%) and CF (89 ± 7.1% and 75.0 ± 7.3%) groups. The reduction in the force and duration of centrifugation did not decrease the sperm recovery during selection by the Percoll gradient and the use of CF in the second centrifugation did not affect the normal fertilization and development of bovine IVF embryos up to 48 h.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31618/24008,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Marandu palisade grass management strategies at the beginning of the deferment period and effects on tillering,"Pasture mowing at the beginning of deferment stimulates tillering and can be used in different ways. The aim of this study was to understand how the mowing of Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu Syn. Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu (marandu palisade grass) prior to the deferment period modifies tillering activity and the characteristics of young, mature, and old tillers. Three mowing strategies were evaluated: canopies kept at a height of 15 cm for five months before deferment (15/15 cm); canopies kept at 30 cm (30/15 cm) or 45 cm (45/15 cm) for five months before deferment and posteriorly cut to 15 cm at the start of the deferment period. The structural characteristics of young, mature, and old tillers of marandu palisade grass were compared only at the end of the deferment period. The tiller appearance rate was greater before (16.0%) than during (6.4%) the deferment period, but a contrasting response pattern was observed for the tiller mortality rate. The defoliation strategies that resulted in greater numbers of tillers in the canopies were 30/15 cm (2,098 tillers m-²) and 45/15 cm (2,160 tillers m-2). The defoliation strategy that generated the greatest percentage of young tillers in the canopy was 45/15 cm (26.1%), while the percentage of old tillers was greater in the canopies submitted to the 15/15 cm (64.1%) and 30/15 cm (61.5%) strategies. Weight and percentage of live stems of mature and old tillers were greater in relation to young tillers. The percentage of live leaves was grater in young tillers (52.6%), intermediate in mature tillers (41.4%), and lower in old tillers (21.3%). Regarding the percentage of dead leaves, the opposite trend was observed, where the percentage was greater in the old than in young tillers. Leaf area was greater in mature tillers (55.3 cm²) than in old tillers (29.2 cm²). Mowing of the marandu palisade grass to 15 cm at the beginning of the deferment period increases the number of young tillers, which have a more favorable morphological composition than mature and old tillers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28581/23983,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Productive performance of Nellore steers on rotational grazing on Marandu grass and Convert HD 364 grass,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Brachiaria spp. Cv. Mulato II (Convert) on performance, meat quality and carcass characteristics of castrated Nellore steers in the growing and finishing phases, in rotational grazing system, compared to Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, under the same conditions. The experimental area was divided into two treatments: Marandu and Convert with 20 hectares each, splited in four replications per treatment, composed of five paddocks of one hectare each. Animals were managed based on the availability of leaf blade dry matter (6.19% body weight) in rotational grazing with 7 days of occupation and 28 days of rest. Ten animals were used in each replicate (testers), as well as regulatory animals whenever necessary. Animals were managed based on the availability of leaf blade dry matter (6.19% body weight) in rotational grazing with 7 days of occupation and 28 days of rest. Ten animals were used in each replicate (testers), as well as regulatory animals whenever necessary. For performance analysis, 10 animals of each replicate were used, while for carcass and meat analyses, only six of each replicate. Production and chemial characteristics of the two grasses were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and four replicates; data were tested by analysis of variance using the R software. Animals fed on Convert grass were superior than those fed on Marandu grass, with higher average daily gain (0.682 kg vs. 0.605 kg), slaughter weight (470.45 kg vs. 451.43 kg), hot carcass weight (239.93 kg vs. 232.36 kg). The study also showed the possibility of finishing castrated young steers (up to 30 months) and with subcutaneous fat thickness required by industry (3 mm) in both pastures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29241/23984,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Chemical restraint of jaguars Panthera onca Linnaeus, 1758 with allometrically scaled doses of tiletamine, zolazepam, detomidine, and atropine","Chemical restraint of large felids is necessary for the handling, transportation, clinical assessment, and induction of anesthesia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemical restraint using a combination of tiletamine, zolazepam, detomidine, and atropine with interspecific allometric scaling doses in captive Panthera onca. There were ten males (two melanistic ones) and five females weighing between 35 and 80 kg. The evaluation of the chemical restraint protocol was carried out during routine management of the animals for physical examination, collection of blood and bone marrow samples, dental evaluation, and other procedures. During pre-established intervals, rectal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, nociception of thoracic and pelvic limbs, muscle relaxation and loss of the righting reflex were monitored. Loss of the righting reflex occurred at 8 ± 1.89 minutes post-injection (MPI). Respiratory rate returned at 77.6 ± 8.18 MPI; return of consciousness occurred at 112.6 ± 12.28 MPI, and complete recovery at 153 ± 12.47 MPI. There were no statistical differences between heart and respiratory rate means and oxyhemoglobin saturation. For rectal temperature, there was a significant reduction. The protocol analyzed was efficient for the chemical restraint of jaguars, enabling the manipulation, transportation, physical examination, dental evaluation, blood and bone marrow sample collection, and other minor invasive procedures of medium duration in these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30330/23981,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Neospora caninum in crossbred dairy cows in Uberlândia,"Neospora caninum causes reproductive disorders in dairy cattle such as repeat breeding, abortion, and anestrus, which are risk factors associated with the seroprevalence of N. caninum in Brazil and worldwide. This study aimed to verify the risk factors related to the seroprevalence of Neospora caninum in crossbred dairy cows in the city of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais. During, January to July 2013, 740 blood samples were collected from 57 herds with a history of reproductive disorders and determinations of antibody titers against N. caninum were obtained by ELISA assay. The seroprevalence of N. caninum was 18.4% (136/740). Risk factors for N. caninum were cows greater than 2 years of age (P = 0.034), mechanical milking (P = 0.012), and frequent purchase of animals (P = 0.004), in addition to individual history of abortion (P = 0.007) and repeat breeding (P = 0.030). The highest probability of occurrence of associated risk factors was associated with individual history of abortion and repeated breeding and the frequent purchase of animals, with odds of 12.8, 5.9, and 3.8 times, respectively. In conclusion, the risk factors associated with N. caninum: members of the female sex and cows with more than 2 years-of-age, mechanical milking, and the frequent purchase of animals, in addition to individual history of abortion and repeated breeding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30147/23980,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Prevention of acute ruminal lactic acidosis in sheep by probiotic or monensin supplementation: clinical aspects,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two additives (probiotic and monensin) over clinical parameters of sheep submitted to acute ruminal lactic acidosis (ARLA). Eighteen sheeps were divided into three groups of six animals each as follows: probiotic group, supplemented with 4×109 CFU/animal/day of Saccharomyces cerevisiae; monensin group, supplemented with 33 mg of monensin sodium per kg of diet; and control group, without any supplementation. After 30 days of diet (75% of Coast-cross hay and 25% concentrate with 14% of crude protein) and additive intake, ARLA was induced in the all animals by intraruminal administration of 15g of sucrose per kilogram (kg) of body weight. Complete physical examinations to assess the vital signs of the animals were conducted at the following times: baseline (T0), six (T6h), 12 (T12h), 18 (T18h), 24 (T24h), 36 (T36h), and 48 (T48h) hours after ARLA induction. At those times, blood samples were obtained to determine the plasma volume deficit (PVD) and ruminal content for pH measurement. All animals experienced clinical signs of ARLA with ruminal pH lower than 4.9 at T24h. The heart rate and PVD were lower (P < 0.05) in the probiotic group at T36h. Compared to the control and monensin groups, the probiotic group experienced milder ARLA characterized by lower degrees of dehydration and fewer clinical symptoms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29911/24037,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Method for auxiliary use of thermography in diagnosing inflammation in the coxofemoral joint in dogs,"Joint diseases are relatively common in domestic animals, such as dogs. The involved inflammation produces thermal emission, which can be imaged using specific sensors that allow capturing of infrared images. Given that there have been few reports on the use of thermography in the diagnosis of inflammation associated with diseases of the hip joint in dogs, we here propose a method for identification of inflammatory foci in dogs by using infrared thermometry. The present study aimed to find non-invasive and low-cost resources that couldfacilitate a clinical diagnosis in cases withinflammation in the coxofemoral joint of dogs.To this end, we developed a system in whichthe Flir Systems TG165 thermograph is coupled to a black PVC cannula with a 30-cm focus-to-animal distance.External effects of the environment on the temperature of the animalswere compared with the body temperature as measured by a conventional thermometer.Thirty-one dogs with and without inflammation in the coxofemoral joint underwent clinical evaluation.We verified that the temperature registered by the thermograph inthe animals with joint inflammation was significantlydifferentfrom that incontrol animals without inflammation, in the lateral projection.The method showed a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 87.5%, and accuracy of 83.87%. This standardized method of diagnosis of inflammatory foci in the coxofemoral articulation of dogs by way of thermography showed sensitivity, specificity, and satisfactory accuracy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29508/23978,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Somatic cell count in the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in sheep of different breeds,"The aims of this study were to determine the occurrence of subclinical mastitis in sheep of different breeds and the values for somatic cell count (SCC) in milk for the diagnosis of the disease at lactation and weaning, a fundamental prerequisite for identifying animals in need of control measures. Milk samples were obtained from 1,457 mammary halves of Santa Inês, Texel, Ile de France, and Dorper sheep at two different periods, during the second week of lactation and at weaning. After teats antisepsis, the samples were collected, and identification of the infectious etiology of mastitis and determination of SCC were performed. Microorganisms were identified in 117/762 (15.3%) mammary halves in the second week of lactation and in 86/694 (12.4%) at weaning. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the etiological agents with the highest incidence alone and in association with other microorganisms, with percentages of 58.1% and 60.6%, respectively. The Santa Inês presented a higher incidence of subclinical mastitis when compared to the other breeds. The cut-off values of SCC for subclinical mastitis were determined at both sampling periods and varied according to stage of lactation, as well breed. These results illustrate the lack of a universal value that can be used for the diagnosis of mastitis and suggests the need for permanent follow-up in herds in order to control the disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27028/23977,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Triticum aestivum in open skin wounds: cytotoxicity and collagen histopathology,"Phytoterapic compounds have been used in wound healing for many centuries. Nowadays, scientific evidences of phytotherapeutics is a requirement of the legislation. The scientific literature notes the need for healing topics yielding scars that are both aesthetically appealing and resistant. We aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of several doses of T. aestivum extract (2 mg mL-1, 4 mg mL-1, 6 mg mL-1, 8 mg mL-1 and 10 mg mL-1) in a fibroblast cell line and the healing process in an in vivo experimental model (New Zealand rabbits). For this, MTT test in 3T6 cells was performed in duplicates using MEM (0 mg ml-1) as negative control. Cell viability was calculated as: absorbance average in treatments/absorbance average in controls x 100. In vivo test was performed in 78 skin wounds in rabbits that were treated with 2 mg ml-1and 10 mg ml-1 of T. aestivum and non-ionic cream for 21 days. After this period, it was evaluated the histology using picrosorius and Gomori’s trichrome staining. Statistical analysis was evaluated using T test (Graphpad) for cytotoxicity assay, Fischer test for the gomori trichrome test (Grahpad) and Kruskal-Wallis (Statistic 9.0) for picrosirius test. The in vitro test resulted in cytotoxicity observed at 2mg mL-1 whereas cells were viable at higher doses. On the other hand, it was observed that collagen formation of wounds was more uniform with this dose than with 10mg mL-1 extract in the in vivo study. Thus, we conclude that the 2mg mL-1 T. aestivum aqueous extract dose was more efficient in the in vivo wound healing study, despite its cytotoxic effects in vitro.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26288/23976,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Changes in quality during maturation of physalis fruit,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in quality of fruits of two species of physalis (P. angulata and P. pubescens) harvested from family farmer orchards in different maturity stages, comparing with fully ripen fruits to those of the commercial species (P. peruviana) of similar maturity. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, in five maturity stages for P. angulata and in four for P. pubescens. Data were submitted to variance analysis and means of the maturity stages compared by the Tukey test at 5 % probability. For the comparison of fully ripen fruits of P. peruviana with the two species produced in different locations were used six replications and the means compared by Dunnett's test at 5 % probability. The fruit diameter varied from 15.1 to 18.0 mm that classifies it as of caliber B. During maturation the color of the fruit evolved from green to totally yellow (P. angulata) and to yellow-brown with purplish features (P. pubescens). The soluble solids (SS) contents of the fruits of P. angulata were superior to those of P. pubescens and the commercial species. Comparing with commercial species, the SS/AT ratio was higher in locally produced fruits, indicating more palatable fruits. Fruits of P. angulata present favorable characteristics for fresh consumption, with potential for extensive cultivation and trade in family horticulture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30368/23973,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Detection of Salmonella spp. and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in fresh pork sausages,"The presence of pathogenic microorganisms in meat products may result in foodborne diseases and economic losses to their producers. Small industries in the region of Londrina, Paraná, produce sausages that are commercialized in free fairs, small markets, bars, and restaurants in the city. Although these industries are inspected by the Municipal Inspection Service of Londrina, there are no data about the pathogenic microorganisms present in these products. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of Salmonella spp. in sausages produced and sold in the region of Londrina, Paraná, and identify eae, bfp, stx1, stx2, hlyA, ipaH, elt, est, aggR, aap, and AA probe genes in Escherichia coli strains isolated from these samples. Forty-six samples of three types of sausages (fresh pork, Tuscan, and Calabresa) produced by four different producers (brands A, B, C, and D) were analyzed. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 13 (28.3%) and E. coli from 33 (71.3%) of the analyzed samples. Seven (53.8%) of 13 samples contaminated with Salmonella spp. were from brand A. Salmonella spp. contamination was the highest in the Tuscan sausage samples (8/17, 41.7%) when compared with the fresh pork sausage samples of all brands analyzed. E. coli was isolated from 12 of 13 samples contaminated with Salmonella spp. One sample of Calabresa sausage was contaminated with atypical enteropathogenic E. coli serotype O108:H9 that has the eae and hlyA genes. The results suggest contamination of the processing plant and/or raw meat used in the manufacture of sausages. A better inspection of the industries is required to ensure that Good Manufacturing Practices are followed by which the contamination of products by pathogenic bacteria can be prevented.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32068/24019,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Physical-chemical, nutritional and antioxidant properties of tucumã (Astrocaryum huaimi Mart.) fruits","The Brazilian Cerrado contains a large number of fruit species whose nutritional and physical-chemical properties have not been fully characterized to date. The fruit of tucumã (Astrocaryum huaimi Mart) is ellipsoid with fibrous and gelatinous pulp, unique odor, and has significant economic importance in the region. The objective of this study is to analyze the physical-chemical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties of the fruit of tucumã grown in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Water content, ashes, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, total dietary fiber, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, vitamin C, minerals, and fatty acids were analyzed. Total phenols, tannins, and antioxidant activity were analyzed using the Folin-Ciocalteau method, Folin-Denis method, and photocolorimetric method of the stable free radical DPPH, respectively, in aqueous, acetone, and ethanol extracts. The most relevant components in the fruit were lipids, fibers, vitamin C, unsaturated fatty acids, iron, potassium, manganese, and bioactive compounds. The analysis of the bioactive compounds revealed that the fruit has high antioxidant activity. The acetone extract presented the highest antioxidant capacity followed by the ethanol and aqueous extracts. The results indicated that the tucumã fruit has high nutritional value as a source of lipids, fibers, calories, vitamin C, minerals, and unsaturated fatty acids, and high antioxidant activity. Therefore, consuming the tucumã fruit pulp may help prevent nutritional deficiencies and chronic non-communicable diseases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30864/24036,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Selection of entomopathogenic nematodes and evaluation of their compatibility with cyantraniliprole for the control of Hypothenemus hampei,"Attack by the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei causes significant damage to coffee crops because it affects the quality of the coffee fruit during different developmental stages, which results in production losses. Control of the borer is difficult owing to its cryptic behavior and the fact that it spends its entire life cycle inside the coffee berries. This makes it difficult for natural enemies to reach it, as well as for it to come into contact with chemical insecticides. The objective of the present study was to select and evaluate the virulence of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) on the coffee berry borer H. hampei and their compatibility with the insecticide cyantraniliprole under laboratory conditions. Initially, the pathogenicity and virulence of 16 isolates of Steinernema and Heterorhabditis towards coffee berry borer larvae and adults were evaluated. The most virulent isolates to both larvae and adults were determined by topical inoculation tests in coffee fruits (berries) infested by the insect, using a concentration of 100 infective juveniles (IJs)/fruit. The same isolates were also evaluated for viability and infectivity when combined with cyantraniliprole. The isolates S. feltiae (IBCB-n 47) and Heterorhabditis amazonensis (GL) displayed the highest virulence towards adults (54%). For larvae, we observed a high virulence of S. feltiae, Heterorhabditis amazonensis, Heterorhabditis indica, Heterorhabditis sp. (JPM4), Heterorhabditis sp. (NEPET 11), Heterorhabditis sp. (IBCB-n 46), and Heterorhabditis sp. (IBCB-n 44) that promoted 100% mortality. Regarding the topical inoculation test on infested fruits, S. feltiae and Heterorhabditis sp. (IBCB-n 46) were unable to penetrate the fruit through the hole made by the borer, infect, and cause the death of insects. Cyantraniliprole formulation affected the viability of IJs of S. feltiae and Heterorhabditis sp. (IBCB-n 46), mainly after 48 h of exposure.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32109/24035,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Color parameters applied to pedotransfer functions in the estimation of soil attributes,"Global demands for an increased food production have prompted scientists to create technological innovations in various segments of the agricultural and environmental sectors. The use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in soil color determination to estimate its attributes is an example of these advances. Thus, the aim of this research was to identify the potential of the three parameters of the Munsell color system (Hue, Value, and Chroma) in estimating different chemical and particle size attributes by pedotransfer functions in a Typic Hapludox in the Cerrado of Piauí State, Brazil. This soil showed a yellowish color due to the goethite and low contents of bases and organic carbon. Among the calibrated pedotransfer functions, we observed that phosphorus, aluminum, hydrogen, potential acidity, potential cation exchange capacity, and base saturation could be estimated by Hue, while clay content by Value, and Chroma used to estimate hydrogen, potential acidity, and cation exchange capacity. We conclude that the parameter color could be used to estimate soil attributes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31114/23969,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Cold tolerance of forage plant species,"The occurrence of frost in southern and southeastern Brazil affects pasture quality and limits the use of forage species with high yield potential. Therefore, elucidating the cold tolerance of individual forage species could facilitate the selection of species that will optimize production and animal feeding throughout the year. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the cold tolerance of forage species to low temperatures, based on cell membrane stability and photoinhibition. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), black oat (Avena strigosa), marandu grass (Urochloa brizantha), pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum), mombaça grass (Megathyrsus maximus), and bermuda grass ‘Tifton 85’ (Cynodon spp) plants were subjected to temperatures of 0.2, -0.9, -1.8, -2.7, -4.1, -4.6, and -6.2 °C for 1 h in a growth chamber. Cell membrane stability and photoinhibition were based on the electrical conductivity of leaf section solutions and chlorophyll fluorescence, respectively. Initial cold damage corresponded to a sudden increase in leaf solution conductivity and decrease in fluorescence. Millet and sorghum were able to tolerate exposure to temperatures as low as -2.7 °C, whereas black oat, marandu grass, alfafa, and mombaça grass were able to tolerate exposure to -4.1 °C, and bermuda grass ‘Tifton 85’ was able to withstand temperatures below -6.2 °C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31070/23968,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Characteristics and classification of the quality and productive standards of the mombaça grass under a livestock-forest system or full sun,"The objective of this study is to identify qualitative and productive changes in Mombasa grass under a livestock-forest system or full sun and to classify the variables that are most relevant for evaluating the qualitative performance of these systems. The experiments were conducted in shade areas, with four replications for each of the 12 treatments, including four growth cycles and three levels of shading in Mombasa grass, totaling 48 experimental units. Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and dry mass production (DMP) (kg ha-1) were used as discriminatory variables for the shading groups. The levels of nutrients and shading in Mombaça grass were classified using Fisher multivariate discriminant analysis (FMDA). The FDMA indicated that Mg, K, P, N, and DMP formed a discriminant function. However, DMP was the least important variable for identifying the groups. Five groups were pre-defined before FDMA: MFS 2 (Mombasa grass in full sun in the second cycle), MFS 6 (Mombasa grass in full sun in the sixth cycle), MFS 7 (Mombasa grass in full sun in the seventh cycle), M25 4 (Mombasa grass at 25% shading in the fourth cycle), and M25 7 (Mombasa grass at 25% shading in the seventh cycle). The results indicate that Mg, P, K, and N are helpful for identifying new genotypes of plants grown on shading conditions because of the responsiveness and stability of these elements to environmental changes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30405/24034,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Earthworms and Fusarium oxysporum: effect on strawberry plant growth and production,"Earthworms are soil invertebrates that play an important environmental role and are often referred to as “ecosystem engineers”. These invertebrates can influence several organisms, from microscopic life forms to plants. Although many works had reported positive effects of earthworms on plant growth, studies combining these invertebrates and soil pathogens showed numerous positive interactions. Fusarium wilt is a global disease that can cause severe damage to strawberry fields. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of inoculation of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae) in strawberry plants. This greenhouse experiment was carried out in the University of Seville School of Agricultural Engineering, Utrera City, Spain. Strawberries (Rooted cuttings) were planted in plastic pots and administered the following treatments: Control (absence of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae and earthworms), T1 (absence of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, two L. terrestris per pot), T2 (inoculum of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, absence of L. terrestris), and T3 (inoculum of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae and two L. terrestris). Weekly fruit production was measured for seven months. After this period the shoot fresh weight and the leaf nutrient content was measured. The results obtained showed no interaction between L. terrestris and F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae on strawberry production. T1 treatment resulted in fruit production superior to other treatments, including the control. An absence of differences in dry shoot matter was observed with earthworm treatment, and small differences were found in the leaf nutrient content. The earthworm inoculation was unable to suppress the negative effects of Fusarium wilt in strawberry production. However, positive effects such as a reduction in the disease severity were found in the earthworm treated plants. In treatments without F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae inoculation, the presence of earthworms increased plant productivity by 44.21 g per pot, compared with the control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30172/23965,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Isolated and combined effects of soil salinity and waterlogging in seedlings of ‘Green Dwarf’ coconut,"Soil salinization is a problem commonly found in semi-arid regions. In addition, the problem of salinity is aggravated in clayey soils when accompanied by cycles of waterlogging in the rainy season or when excess irrigation is applied. In this work we evaluated the isolated and combined effects of soil salinity and waterlogging on the responses of young plants of ‘Green Dwarf’ coconut. The experiment was conducted under controlled environment in a complete randomized block design, arranged in split plots with five replications. The plots comprised five waterlogging cycles (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4), each with a duration of four days, and applied at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days into the experimental period, with the sub-plots consisting of five levels of soil salinity (1.70, 11.07, 16.44, 22.14 and 25.20 dS m-1). Response of coconut seedlings to waterlogging was dependent on the level of soil salinity, with waterlogging significantly impairing biomass accumulation and leaf expansion at low soil salinity levels, but causing no additional harm at elevated salinity. Leaf gas exchange was reduced mainly due to soil salinity, and this response was related to stomatal and non-stomatal effects. Seedlings of ‘Green Dwarf’ coconut used in this study were classified as moderately-tolerant to salinity when grown in soils with an electrical conductivity up to 11.07 dS m-1, having the potential to be used in revegetation programs of salt-affected areas, provided that these areas are not exposed to frequent waterlogging cycles.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30674/23967,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effects of nitrogen dosage and urea source on morphological composition and forage accumulation in massai grass,"The effects of nitrogen (N) dose and urea source on forage mass (FM), percentage of dry matter of leaf blades (LBDMP), stem (SDMP), and dead material (DMDMP), and the forage accumulation rate (FAR) of Panicum maximum ‘Massai’ (massai grass) were evaluated. We set up an experiment with a completely randomized block design in a factorial arrangement (3×2) + 1, consisting of three doses (100, 200, and 400 kg ha–1 year–1), two urea sources (common and coated with Policote®), and a control treatment, in five consecutive climatic seasons, including the summers of 2011/2012 (summer I), autumn, winter, and spring of 2012, and the summers of 2012/2013 (summer II). We found an interaction effect between N dose, urea source, and season (p < 0.05). LBDMP linearly increased during dry periods (autumn and winter) and SDMP in autumn and DMDMP in winter linearly decreased when coated urea were used. FAR showed a linear increase with the use of both urea sources, except for common urea in autumn, and the increases in the winter were owing to a greater contribution of leaf blades to FM. The use of coated urea for N fertilization linearly increases FAR in all seasons of the year and improves the morphological composition of the forage of massai grass, mainly in dry seasons.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30012/23963,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nutrient acquisition and eucalyptus growth affected by humic acid sources and concentrations,"Humic acid (HA) can increase eucalyptus growth due to its biostimulant effect and improvement in plant nutrient uptake. Magnitude of these stimuli varies according to the source, chemical composition, presence of bioactive fragments, and concentration of HA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of HA sources and concentrations on dry matter, accumulation and uptake efficiency (UpE) of nutrients for eucalyptus seedlings cultivated in nutrient solution. A randomized block experimental design was adopted, with four replications, in a 3x4+1 factorial scheme, in which three sources of HA (HA-L1 and HA-L2, derived from different commercial HA extracted from leonardite with 0.5 mol L-1 NaOH and 0.5 mol L-1 KOH, respectively, and HA-Com, which was extracted from compost with 0.5 mol L-1 KOH) were combined with four concentrations of C-HA (5, 10, 25, and 100 mg L-1) as well as a control treatment in which eucalyptus was cultivated without HA. Eucalyptus seedlings were grown for 20 days, maintaining three plants per pot. At the end of the experiment, production of shoot dry matter (SDM), root dry matter (RDM), and total dry matter (TDM); the Root: Shoot dry matter ratio; and the accumulations of N, P, K, Ca, B, Cu, Fe, and Zn in the shoot and root were evaluated as well as the UpE of these nutrients by the seedlings. Maximum production of SDM was reached at the concentrations of 14 and 13.5 mg L-1 of C-HA, for HA-L1 and HA-Com, respectively. The RDM increased with the use of HA-Com, with optimal concentration of 55 mg L-1 of C-HA. Accumulation of Fe in the eucalyptus shoot decreased in HA-treated pots, compromising Fe translocation from the root to the shoot. Regardless of HA source used, Cu accumulation by plants diminishes as C-HA concentration increases. A greater growth of eucalyptus at concentrations lower than 15 mg L-1 of C-HA occurs more through the stimulus to shoot and root growth than due to greater acquisition and UpE of nutrients by plants. Use of high concentrations of C-HA requires greater concentration of some micronutrients in the nutrient solution tested.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30033/23964,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Productivity in seeds of the green bean produced under conventional and organic systems,"Two experiments were carried out during 2016 at the Anápolis Experimental Station of EMATER in the State of Goiás, with the aim of studying the yield of seeds of 18 strains and two indeterminate cultivars of the green bean, one experiment under a conventional system and the other under an organic system. A randomized block experimental design was used, with twenty treatments and three replications, to evaluate the mean number of seeds per pod (NSP), 100-seed weight (100SW) and productivity (PROD). Under the conventional system, the 100SW ranged from 19.3 to 25.0 grams. The highest productivity was achieved with the UEG 0212, UEG 0212, UEG 0712 and UEG 3014 strains, which were superior to the other strains, including the controls. Under the organic system, there was a range of 6.66 to 8.33 for the NSP, while for the 100SW, the range was from 23 to 32 grams. The UEG 0212, UEG 1012, UEG 2014 and UEG 3014 strains, all with cylindrical pods and white seeds, can be used as alternatives for planting, being superior to the ‘Favorito’ cultivar and equal to the ‘Macarrão Bragança’ cultivar, whereas UEG 1112 and UEG 0714, with cylindrical pods and cream-colored seeds, can be used as dual-adapted cultivars, with green pods and dry grain that can be used as end-of-cycle pods if there are defects that are not accepted by the market.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29744/23971,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Decomposition of straw resulting from different strategies of recovery of degraded pastures using an integrated crop-livestock system,"Several strategies have been used to improve soil fertility using integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems, and the harvest of the accompanying crop used for silage may have several benefits to the soil depending on the quantity and quality of the remaining litter, providing dry matter (DM) for no-tillage systems and nutrient mineralization for the subsequent crop. The objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of decomposition of macro- and micronutrients of the DM of litter produced in ICL systems at different harvest heights in one year. The study was developed at the Experimental Farm of UNESP in Selvíria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in the dry season. The study included five replications in plots of 200 m2 and was arranged in a completely randomized block design. The following treatments were analyzed: control sample-degraded pasture of signal grass; Marandu grass-pasture renewal from signal grass to Marandu grass; succession 45-planting of sorghum (forage sorghum cv. Volumax) and crop harvest at the height of 45 cm for silage followed by planting of Marandu grass; simultaneous seeding of Marandu grass and sorghum, and crop harvesting for silage at the height of 15 cm (Marandu + sorghum 15) and 45 cm (Marandu + sorghum 45) from the soil surface. After crop harvesting, proportional amounts of green mass remaining from each unit were collected, transferred to nylon bags, and placed in direct contact with the soil of the respective experimental unit. Each bag was opened every 30 days after closure for up to 270 days. In each bag, the DM, and macro- and micronutrients were analyzed, and the percentage of remaining material, daily decomposition rate, and half-life were calculated. The litter of the Marandu + sorghum 45 treatment contained the highest DM, decomposition rate, and nutrient content. The crop succession provided the best condition of the litter, with the highest DM on the soil surface, which improved soil conditions and made the soil less susceptible to degradation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29966/23962,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Forty years of Semina: Ciências Agrárias,"In 2018, Semina, the cultural and scientific magazine of the State University of Londrina (UEL), is celebrating 40 years of operation. The first edition of April/June 1978 was published under the management of the Dean Professor Dr. Oscar Alves and the Vice-Dean Professor Dr. Pedro Vasconcelos Barros, with an Editorial Board comprised of President Professor Theobaldo Cioci Navolar, Director Professor Enoque Balbino Lima, and Members of the Editorial Board Professor Maria Luzel de Oliveira Cauduro, Professor Dr. Jesus Berbel, Professor Leange Severo Alves, and Professor Aldo Matsumoto. With its motto “everything that is planted, grows,” Semina originated as an organ of cultural and scientific dissemination of UEL, an institution located in a region with one of the richest soils in the world, Northern Paraná. In addition, Semina means seed, a word derived from the Latin words terrain and seminis. Thus, the UEL periodic, which means “Seeds” in plural, symbolizes the goal of sowing culture and science in the minds of its readers by disseminating works and activities in all fields of knowledge and culture. The history of the Semina periodic complements the history of the University itself, which was founded on January 28, 1970 by a decree of the then governor of Paraná, Paulo Pimentel. Since its first edition in 1978, the Semina magazine has been following the scientific and cultural development of our University. In Semina’s 40 years of existence, UEL has grown considerably, with an increase in the number of its faculty, administrative staff, and students; this is a result of the growing demand for development in the region and the creation of new latu sensu and stricto sensu undergraduate and postgraduate courses, which has led to a consequent increase in the intellectual production of the institution. The internal growth of UEL and the region increased the demand for internal and external scientific production, which triggered a natural pressure for restructuring and revision of the periodic’s capacity to meet the changes and demands related to this development. Thus, in 1987, Semina began to publish specific issues for each of the four major areas of knowledge: Agrarian Sciences, Biological and Health Sciences, Social and Human Sciences, and Exact and Technological Sciences. Semina: Ciências Agrárias was effectively created in its current form in 2001, with a new ISSN record, and published two issues per year until 2003, four until 2011 and, six or more per year, including supplementary issues, since 2012. With this new division, the current Semina: Ciências Agrárias was indexed in the ISI of Thomson Reuters (SCIE), CAB Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts (CAS), Food Science and Technology (FSTA), AGRIS DATABASE, SCOPUS, and DOAJ, thus offering new opportunities for the publication of scientific papers with the guarantee of wide national and international dissemination. In 2009, Semina: Ciências Agrárias started to be published by the Open Journal Systems (OJS) a software developed for the construction and management of electronic journal publications and its papers were made freely available in the Portal of Scientific Journals of UEL. It began receiving submissions through this electronic system, which increased its access and streamlined the procedure. Since then, Semina: Ciências Agrárias has been ranked by the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of Thomson Reuters with an initial impact factor of 0.182. Currently, the impact factor is 0.309 for JCR and 0.350 for SJR (Scientific Journal Rankings) of the editor SCImago. Due to its performance in these important indexes of the Agrarian Sciences and the ease of electronic submission, there was a great increase in the number of papers submitted to be evaluated for publication. This increase allowed an improved selection of published papers and, since 2005, publication in English has been prioritized. Thus, the number of papers published per issue increased to 15 in 2005, to 40 in 2011, and in to 50 in 2013, a number maintained until today. From 2010, Semina: Ciências Agrárias started to use DOI (Digital Object Identifier), an identifier of intellectual property with a unique and exclusive standard code consisting of numbers and letters that enables the creation of a permanent link to a published digital document, easing the access to papers published online. In June 2010, Semina: Ciências Agrárias received its first impact factor evaluation in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. It was observed that the evolution of the magazine occurred in parallel to the growth of UEL’s three Post-Graduate Programs in the wide area of Agricultural Sciences: Food Science, Animal Science, and Agronomy. In January 2018, UEL completed 48 years; the undergraduate program in Veterinary Medicine has run for 45 of these years, and Semina: Ciências Agrárias for 40 years, both making a significant contribution to the history of the institution's development. Throughout its 45 years of existence, the undergraduate program in Veterinary Medicine has grown considerably, establishing from the beginning strategies for the scientific and technological development of the institution and the region. Therefore, the Postgraduate program in Animal Health was created, later evolving to the current Masters and Doctorate Programs in Animal Science, with the participation of professors of the Department of Animal Sciences. A highlight of the periodic's long history has been the important participation of the Chief Editor, Professor Dr. Odilon Vidotto, researcher and recognized professor in Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases. In addition to the growth and improvement in the Animal Science, Agronomy and Food Science Post-Graduate Programs at UEL, the impact of Semina: Ciências Agrárias on the national scientific community has been significant, publishing papers from all regions of the country, most of them from several Postgraduate Programs in the areas of Agrarian, Veterinary, Biological, and Health studies. Currently, the periodic publishes bimonthly original and review papers, case reports, and communications from the wide field of Agrarian Sciences (Agronomy, Food Science and Technology, Veterinary Medicine, and Animal Husbandry). In 2018, on the online Electronic Publishing System for Magazines (SEER), Semina completed nine years of operation, showing an upward trajectory of publications. From 1978 to 1987, 257 papers were published, and from 2009 to 2018 (the online period) 2,858 papers were published; in total, 3,840 papers were published so far. This greater number of publications coincided with the creation by Semina of its own bureau and the hiring of a librarian exclusive for the journal. Librarian Edilaine Aparecida Soares is responsible for the bureau's work, standardization, and publication of papers. The online system allows access for more than seven thousand users (authors, evaluators, and editors) and currently has 10,260 users and 4,576 ad hoc evaluators registered. To celebrate the 40 years of Semina: Ciências Agrárias, the current Chief Editor Professora Dra. Ivone Yurika Mizubuti, the on-leave Editor-in-Chief, Professor Dr. Odilon Vidotto, and the Managing Editors Professores Drs. Carmen Silvia Vieira Janeiro Neves and Professora Dra. Elza Iouko Ida, as well as the 20 section editors, would like to thank the authors, evaluators, and the editing team for their important contribution during the entire course of the journal. Their work has resulted in the performance already reported and, in the future, will certainly help Semina: Ciências Agrárias evolve to the highest levels.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34163/24007,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Performance of pre-sprouted sugarcane seedlings in response to the application of humic acid and plant growth-promoting bacteria,"Sugarcane cultivation using pre-sprouted seedlings has decreased the number of stalks used per hectare, increased the multiplication rate, improved seedling health, and increased planting uniformity. However, because this system has been only recently proposed, the number of studies evaluating this new technology is still scarce, particularly those examining the effect of the application of growth-promoting substances on seedling characteristics during the production phase. Here, we hypothesized that it is possible to combine the plant growth-promoting activity of humic acid (HA) with the inoculation of selected strains of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) to improve the yield of sugarcane seedlings compared with the individual application of these two techniques. The potential of the combined use of HA and PGPB as agricultural inputs was evaluated by conducting an experiment with sugarcane micro cuttings in a greenhouse. Treatments included control, PGPB, HA, and PGPB with HA. At the end of the experiment (60 d after planting), the plants were subjected to biometric evaluation. The results indicated that it was possible to combine HA with selected strains of PGPB (Burkholderia sp.) to improve the yield of seedlings compared with individual HA and PGPB treatments. HA, PGPB, and HA + PGPB increased the total dry matter compared with the control by 23%, 25%, and 36%, respectively. Therefore, the use of HA-based plant regulators in combination with PGPB was more effective than the isolated use of these inputs for the treatment of micro cuttings and improvement of sugarcane seedling yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31334/23529,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Performance and carcass traits of Nellore cattle fattening on pasture receiving different zinc contents in the mineral supplementation,"The objective of this work was to study the effect of different zinc content (ZnSO4) in the mineral supplementation for Nellore steers grazing Brachiaria brizantha (cv) MG-4, on productive performance and carcass traits. Twenty-eight castrated animals with average body weight of 355 kg, were used. The animals were randomly divided into four groups and housed in paddocks of 6.25 ha each one, equipped with covered feeders and waterers, and grazed alternately each 28 days. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four zinc (Zn) content and seven repetitions. Different zinc content were: Zn-0, without Zn; Zn-2, with 2,000 mg Zn kg-1; Zn-4, with 4,000 mg Zn kg-1; and Zn-6, with 6,000 mg Zn kg-1; in the inorganic form (Zinc Sulphate) in mineral supplement. Mineral supplements were given ad libitum in covered troughs and previously weighed, with leftovers control for determining intake. The experimental period was 370 days. Organs, viscera, carcass and non-carcass components were weighed from each slaughtered animal. Loin eye area (LEA) and subcutaneous fat thickness (SFAT), as well as, color, pH and lipid oxidation, were evaluated. The increasing inclusion of zinc content in the diet of steers do not affected (P > 0.05) final body weight (FBW) and average daily weight gain (ADWG). Difference (P < 0.05) was observed in the Zn intake (ZnI) (? = -2.09386 + 146.9616x; R2 = 0.99) and hot carcass weight (?= 299.92662 + 3.33362x; R2= 0.24), as well as, in meat lipid oxidation (? = 0.15170 + 0.02539x; R2= 0.31). There was an increasing linear effect for meat color, evaluated by values of L* (luminosity) (? = 32.23309 + 0.41445x, R2 = 0.14), a* (red-green intensity) (? = 0.88592 + 18.16225x, R2 = 0.25) and b* (yellow-blue intensity) (? = 9.35295 + 0.45030x, R2 = 0.20), but remained within normal values for meat. It can be concluded that beef cattle grazing Brachiaria brizantha MG-4, and supplemented with different zinc contents in mineral supplements, supplied ad libitum, do not show changes in weight gain, carcass yield, physical carcass composition, as well as, in non-carcass components, but the Zn content has a positive linear influence on hot carcass weight, without causing changes in absolute and relative weights of organs and viscera.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32131/23598,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Candidate genes related to reproductive traits of Hereford and Braford bulls,"This study emphasized the importance of using candidate genes in predicting semen quality in bulls that can be used in cow-calf production. The aim of this study was to evaluate some candidate genes related to reproductive traits in Braford and Hereford bulls. All bulls (n=188) were submitted to breeding soundness evaluations at 24, 28, 32, and 36 months of age. The microsatellite markers ILSTS002 and BMS3004 associated with the luteinizing hormone-? (LH?) gene, IDVGA-51 to leptin (LEP) gene, HEL5 and AFZ1 within the IGF-IR gene, and two SNP markers (LHR and FSHR) associated with the LHR and FSHR genes, respectively, were evaluated by the amplification of DNA products. The variation in the IDVGA-51 allele 177-185 showed polymorphic information content (PIC) associated with sperm motility and vigor traits in Hereford bulls. Hereford animals showed PIC of 0.36 to 0.75% along with expected heterozygosity (H) of 0.49 to 0.78%. Braford bulls that indicated the ILSTS002 allele 137-175 and AFZ1 allele 113-119 showed PIC associated with major and minor defects, respectively. The PIC ranged from 0.28 to 0.78%, with an expected H of 0.35 to 0.81%. AFZ1 allele 121-127 had the highest minor defects and ILSTS002 allele 125-135 showed the highest major defects from ejaculated semen in Braford bulls. In addition, IDVGA-51 allele 175 showed lower motility and vigor in Hereford bulls. The markers AFZ1 (IGF-IR) and ILSTS002 (LH?) in Braford and IDVGA-51 (LEP) in Hereford bulls were effective in verifying the reproductive traits of the bulls.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30750/23527,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Mathematical models to describe the growth curves of white-egg layers,"The aim of this study was to compare mathematical models describing growth curves of white-egg layers at different population densities. To fit the models, 4,000 growing white-egg layers were utilized. The experimental design was completely randomized, with population densities of 71, 68, 65, 62, and 59 birds per cage in the starter phase and 19, 17, 15, 13, and 11 birds per cage in the grower phase, with 10 replicates each. Birds were weighed weekly to determine the average body weight and the weight gain. Gompertz and Logistic models were utilized to estimate their growth. The data analysis was carried out using the PROC NLMIXED procedure of the SAS® statistical computer software to estimate the parameters of the equation because mixed models were employed. The mean squared error, the coefficient of determination, and Akaike’s information criterion were used to evaluate the quality of fit of the models. The studied models converged for the description of the growth of the birds at the different densities studied, showing that they were appropriate for estimating the growth of white-egg layers housed at different population densities. The Gompertz model showed a better fit than the Logistic model.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30565/23526,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Identification of productive systems of beef cattle in the northwest Region of Paraná, Brazil","The purpose of this paper is to identify beef cattle production systems in the northwestern part of the state of Paraná, Brazil. To achieve this, interviews with 42 randomly selected cattle breeders were conducted between the months of November and December 2016 to describe the reality of the farms of this region. These interviews were carried out through a semi-structured questionnaire containing 49 questions pertaining to the reality of farms regarding herd management and property (nutrition, health, reproduction, and animal welfare), environment care, property area, and realized activities. Additionally, this questionnaire described the requirements of slaughterhouse for animal housing and the values obtained by the animals marketed according to the producers. After the interviews were carried out, a data bank was created using the software Microsoft Excel (ver. 2010). The data was later transferred to the software PASW 18 for Windows to perform multivariate statistical analyses. Defining the most representative variables was realizedwith multivariate statistical analysis, and these were represented by factor analysis, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis to define the production systems. Through statistical analysis, three different systems were defined: the first production system has 18, the second production system five, and the third production system has 18 cattle breeders. The three systems found in the northwest region of the state of Paraná have different production and marketing characteristics, with the second system being superior to the other systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30255/23525,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Effect of supplementation of guanidinoacetic acid and arginine in vegetable diets for broiler on performance, carcass yield and meat quality","Birds fed with vegetable diets rely on the endogenous synthesis of creatine, which requires amino acids, some of which, for example arginine (Arg), are considered essential for several physiological and metabolic functions. Creatine is limited to high energy expenditure cells, particularly muscle cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of guanidinoacetic acid and arginine (as precursors of creatine) in vegetable diets, on the performance, quality, and yield of broiler chickens. The treatments consisted of diets based on corn and soybean meal (T1); corn, soybean meal + 3% meat meal (T2); corn, soybean meal + 0.08% guanidinoacetic acid (T3); and corn, soybean meal + 0.08% L-arginine (T4). The productive performance of the birds aged 7-, 21-, and 42-days-old was determined. Eighteen 7-day-old birds were sacrificed per treatment to evaluate breast and leg yield, and breast muscle fibers, and eighteen 42-day-old birds were sampled per treatment to determine serum uric acid, urea, creatine, lactate, and glucose concentrations. The same birds were slaughtered to calculate carcass yield in relation to live weight and commercial cut yield. The right pectoralis major muscle of each bird was used to test pH, color (luminosity L*, red index a*, and yellow index b*), and loss of water by pressure analysis, and the left side was used to analyze losses by defrosting and cooking. The data were analyzed using the software SAS. Diets to which meat or vegetable meal plus guanidinoacetic acid or L-Arginine were added resulted in higher live weight and breast meat percentage at 7 days old. Feed conversion was affected for a total period of 1 to 42 days of age (P < 0.0002). The birds with a diet supplemented with vegetable and meat meal had better feed conversion when compared to the birds that were fed with other diets. Treatments did not affect carcass and commercial cut yields, percent loss by cooking, pressure and defrosting of the broiler breast meat, or color (L, a*, and b*) and pH values.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29923/23524,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Coat characteristics and physiological responses of locally adapted ewes in semiarid region of Brazil,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of heat stress and characterize the coat characteristics of red and white varieties of Morada Nova sheep raised in the semiarid region of Brazil during the rainy and dry seasons. The following variables were investigated: coat thickness (CT), inclination angle of the coat (?I), hair coat density (HDE), hair length (HL) and hair diameter (HD), in conjunction with the physiological responses of rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR). The data were tested with an analysis of variance, a Tukey test at a 5% significance level and a correlation analysis. The season of the year (dry and rainy) and the variety (red and white) were used as fixed effects in the analysis of variance. HL, HDE and HD were significantly greater in the dry season than in the rainy season (P < 0.05), but CT and ?I did not differ between seasons (P > 0.05). HL, HDE and HD were lower and ?I was greater (P < 0.05) for the red variety, but CT was statistically equal (P > 0.05) for the two varieties. It was concluded that the coat characteristics of the Morada Nova ewes favor the adaptation of the sheep to a semiarid environment, including the improved protection of the skin against ultraviolet radiation. In general, the white variety presented characteristics reflecting a higher degree of adaptation to the conditions of the Brazilian semiarid region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29595/23522,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Qualitative characteristics of the Longissimus thoracic lumborum muscle of Nellore cattle during different maturation periods,"The effect of maturation on the physical (pH, color, weight loss on cooking, and shear force) and biological (microbiology, concerning mesophiles and psychrotrophiles, and sarcomere length) characteristics of the Longissimus thoracic lumborum muscle of adult Nellore cattle was assessed over four maturation periods (0, 7, 14, and 21 days) and two cut thicknesses (2.5 and 7.5 cm). Sixty-four Longissimus thoracic lumborum muscles from castrated Nellore males were purchased from Frigorífico Nutrial, Sergipe, Brazil. The study was performed using a completely randomized design, corresponding to a 2 x 4 factorial with eight replicates. The microbiological analysis revealed the sanitary conditions in which the samples were handled and stored, yielding counts of psychrotrophiles (2.18 x 105 CFU g-1) and mesophiles (2.4 x 105 CFU g-1) well below the critical deterioration level (106 CFU g-1). The pH (5.57) and the loss on cooking (24.13%) were not influenced by the evaluated variables (P > 0.05). The other evaluated parameters significantly varied as a function of the maturation period and the cut thickness (both P < 0.05). Meat luminosity varied with both the cut thickness and maturation period. The 2.5-cm-thick cut matured for 14 days and the 7.5-cm-thick cut matured for 21 days were darker than the 2.5-cm-thick cut matured for 7 days and the 7.5-cm-thick cut matured for 14 days, which were the lighter-colored samples (similar to non-matured meat). The intensity of the red color of the meat was different beginning after 14 days of maturation in the 7.5-cm cuts (P < 0.05) but differences were not evident in any of the 2.5-cm cuts (P > 0.05). Regarding the b* intensity, the 2.5-cm cut yielded a darker staining at time zero, which decreased with the maturation period. However, the 7.5-cm cut differed between the non-matured and the matured samples. Regarding the red and yellow color of the meat fat (a* and b*, respectively), a* displayed lighter intensity at 7 days of maturation or the 2.5-cm cut (P < 0.05), while the intensity of b* was similar from 7 days of maturation onwards for both cuts (P > 0.05). The shear force of the meat decreased to 4.49 kgf at 21 days of maturation. The sarcomere length varied for the 2.5-cm cut (P < 0.05) but not for the 7.5-cm cut, which remained constant (P > 0.05). Longissimus thoracic lumborum muscle of adult Nellore cattle should be matured as a larger, vacuum-packed cut for a minimum of 14 days to produce meat with improved quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29722/23523,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Distiller’s dried grain with solubles (Zea mays L) in the diet of sheep reared in the tropical region of Brazil: ingestive behavior and physiological parameters,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of inclusion of different levels of distiller’s dried grain with solubles (DDGS) in the diet of sheep raised in the tropical region of Brazil on ingestive behavior and physiological parameters. We used four sheep with mean body weight (BW) of 25 ± 2 kg, distributed in a Latin square design, with four periods, and four DDGS inclusion levels (0, 8, 16, and 24%). The sheep were placed in metabolism cages, and received two meals per day. The data on ingestive behavior and physiological parameters of the sheep were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the observed differences were tested using regression equations at 5% probability. The inclusion of DDGS levels in sheep diets did not change the time spent on ingestive behavior, such as dry matter intake (DMI), rumination (RUM), resting (RES), water intake (WAI), and other activities (OAC) expressed in minutes. However, during the night period, there was an increase (p < 0.05) in the time spent ruminating in relation to the daytime period. However, there was a reduction (p < 0.05) in the time spent on the activities of RES and WAI of the sheep. The inclusion of DDGS in sheep rations did not change (p > 0.05) the physiological parameters measured. However, we found that the afternoon period influenced (p < 0.05) the physiological parameters evaluated, such as body temperature of the front (BTF), body temperature of the rear (BTR), rectal temperature (RET), and respiratory frequency (REF), which were higher in relation to the values observed in the morning. Thus, we conclude that the inclusion of up to 24% of dried distillery grains with solubles in the feeding of sheep in the tropical region of Brazil does not alter the ingestive behavior and physiological parameters of sheep. However, sheep raised in confinement in the tropical region of Brazil spent more time ruminating at night. During the day, sheep spent more time on resting activities and water intake. In addition, sheep raised in a tropical environment need to be monitored for thermal stress during the afternoon, due to the increase in rectal temperature and respiratory frequency. In addition, sheep raised in a tropical environment require greater monitoring of thermal stress during the afternoon, due to the elevation of physiological parameters such as rectal temperature and respiratory frequency in this period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29277/23521,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Dairy activity in family farming in Minas Gerais, Brazil: production costs and cost-effectiveness analysis","The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the cost-effectiveness of three family dairy farms, located in the municipality of Limeira do Oeste, MG, Brazil, as well as to identify the break-even points and the factors that most influenced the final costs, and their impacts on each property. The analyzed data comprised the period from May 2015 to May 2016 and were collected using forms developed by EMATER-MG (Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Company of the State of Minas Gerais) and MDA (Ministry of Agrarian Development). Gross and net margins as well as results (profit or loss) were considered as cost-effectiveness indices. It was realized that the dairy activity in the properties studied exhibited low efficiency in the use of inputs, implying idle productive capacity, an increase in the proportion of fixed costs in the composition of total costs, and low productivity per animal per unit area. Therefore, diary activity was highly dependent on the sale of animals in order to afford and present positive results. Among the components of the effective operating cost, feeding is the most representative (averaging 63.09%), in the three studied properties, being the tax rates considered as fixed (9.41%) and miscellaneous expenses (9.49%) also expressive. The properties showed high fixed costs and break-even points; in one property, these could not be determined as the unit variable cost was higher than the average selling price in the market. In the economic analysis, the three systems showed positive net margins and results, indicative of production viability in the long term.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29192/23581,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of dietary glutamine supplementation associated with threonine levels in the intestinal mucosa of broilers challenged with Eimeria sp. from 22 to 42 days of age,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of glutamine and threonine supplementation on the ileal mucosa of broilers aged 21-42 days. Six-hundred and forty-one-day old chicks of the Cobb Slow lineage were utilized in this study. From 1 to 21 days of age, the chicks received a commercial diet; and after 22 days, the broilers were distributed in a completely randomized design in a 2 ? 4 factorial scheme (challenge and diet), with 4 replications and 20 chicks per experimental unit. At 22 days of age, the challenged broilers received a commercial vaccine against coccidiosis. A commercial diet was utilized as control and three other diets were formulated with reduced crude protein (-3%), and were corrected with the addition of glutamine (Gln) and glutamic acid (Glu) as non-specific nitrogen sources, and finally supplemented with L-Threonine (Thr) at 0.70, 0.80, and 0.85% digestible threonine, respectively. At 28 days of age, diets with Gln/Glu + Thr resulted in greater ileal villi lengths. Challenge with Eimeria sp. reduced the number of goblet cells and increased the duodenal and jejunal crypt depths. At 42 days of age, an interaction was observed between diet and challenge in relation to ileal villi length; better results were observed in the challenged broilers that received 0.85% Gln/Glu + Thr. The mucosal morphology in the ileal villi extremities was preserved in the challenged broilers that received higher Thr levels in their diets. The results suggested that the inclusion of glutamine and threonine affected the morphometry and mucosa of the ileum, thereby improving the mucosal quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29117/23519,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Agricultural answers and chemical composition of Massai grass under different nitrogen doses and urea sources,"Under the hypothesis that modifying nitrogen sources and doses could increase nitrogen fertilization efficiency and productivity and improve forage quality, this study aimed to evaluate the morphological composition, structural characteristics and chemical composition of Panicum maximum cv. Massai forage cultivated under different urea sources (common and coated with Policote®) and nitrogen doses (200, 400 and 600 kg ha-1 year-1) during the autumn, winter and spring of 2014 and the summer and autumn of 2015. The experiment was carried out in Seropédica, RJ, under a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement (3x2) + 1 with four replications. High nitrogen rates promoted higher percentages of leaf blade dry mass and lower percentages of dead material dry mass in the forage mass and provided higher tiller population density and forage accumulation rate of Massai grass during the studied seasons. The use of coated urea promoted higher levels of crude protein in the forage than did the use of common urea in all seasons. The intensification of nitrogen fertilization reduced the nitrogen use efficiency but benefitted the structural characteristics, forage accumulation and chemical composition of Massai grass forage. The use of coated urea promoted greater of nitrogen use efficiency during all seasons of the year.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29071/23580,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of the scale of production on the cost-effectiveness of milk production systems belonging to the “Balde Cheio” program,"This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of 20 demonstration units (DUs) belonging to the ""Balde Cheio"" program. The units in question are from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, dating from January to December 2011, and are sorted according to the scale of production (small, medium and large). The data were analyzed using Predictive Analytical software (PASW) 18.0. The scale of production influenced the total cost of milk production, and therefore profitability and cost-effectiveness. The large-scale stratum showed the lowest total unit cost. The positive results in medium and large scales in milk production lead to optimal conditions for long-term production, with the capitalization of cowmen. The items regarding the effective operating cost (EOC) with the biggest influence on the costs of dairy activity in the small scale stratum were food, energy and miscellaneous expenses. In the medium scale, these were food, labor force, and miscellaneous expenses. Finally, in the large scale, they were food, labor force and energy. In the small and large scale, the items regarding the total cost with the biggest influence on the costs of dairy activity were food, labor force, and return on capital, while in the medium scale, they were food, return on capital, and labor force. The average break-even point of 14 of the DUs was higher than the average daily production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28684/23517,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Bioeconomic efficiency of lamb finishing production systems,"This study aimed to evaluate the production performance, quantitative carcass characteristics, and economic viability of lambs of genetic group Pantaneiro finished under four production systems: 1) Stockpiled Brachiaria brizantha cv piatã pasture; 2) Consortium of sorghum intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha cv piatã; 3) Feedlot based on sorghum silage and 2% body weight energy-protein supplementation, 4) Feedlot based on sorghum silage and 4% body weight energy-protein supplementation. Were used one hundred Pantaneiro lambs with an average body weight of 17.85 ± 2.50 kg and at 70 ± 15 days of age, approximately. The average final body weight and total body weight gain of the animals finished on the consortium of sorghum intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha cv piatã were higher than those obtained with feedlot based on sorghum silage and 2% body weight energy-protein supplementation. However, when this system were compared with sorghum silage and 4% body weight energy-protein supplementation, these characteristics did not differ (P > 0.05). Hot and cold carcass weights were lower when animals were fed sorghum silage and 2% body weight energy-protein supplementation as compared with the animals finished on the other systems. The greatest hot (48.20%) and cold (45.83%) carcass yields were observed in animals finished on sorghum silage and 4% body weight energy-protein supplementation. For the carcass compactness index, animals that received sorghum silage and 4% body weight energy-protein supplementation obtained higher values than those observed for 2% of supplementation. The economic evaluation showed a great return for the finishing systems, except for sorghum silage and 4% body weight energy-protein supplementation, and concluded that finishing lambs in a crop-livestock integration system presented a higher benefit/cost ratio (1.61). Therefore, based on the conditions under which this study was conducted, the crop-livestock integration is the most viable system for finishing lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28584/23516,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Technical and economic efficiency of bovine weighing methods,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the technical and economic efficiency of different methods of cattle weighing, and to develop mathematical equations to estimate the breakeven point for the adoption of electronic weighing, i.e., to estimate how many animals are required for the acquisition and use of an electronic scale to be economically viable. The survey was conducted in confined beef cattle, from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology in the south of Minas Gerais, IFSUL DE MINAS, Muzambinho Campus, from July to December 2014. Two methods of weighing cattle were evaluated: an electronic scale and a tape measure, using a barimetric tape for dairy cattle and a barimetric tape for beef cattle, and a conventional tape measure involving the conversion of centimeters into body weight using a specific table. Thirty-three animals identified with plastic ear tags were weighed using each method. Animals of the Nellore, Senepol, Girolando, and Red-angus breeds, aged 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 years, were weighed 402 times in total. The time taken to weigh animals with the electronic scale was the lowest, followed by that with the barimetric tape, and that with conventional tape measure with conversion. The electronic scale exhibited the greatest technical efficiency, owing to the lack of error and the lowest time required to weigh animals. However, the costs associated with the use of this equipment were the highest, which depended on the purchasing cost. The mathematical equations developed will help technicians and cattle farmers to rapidly and precisely estimate the minimum number of animals that should compose a production system to ensure economic viability for the adoption of an electronic method to weigh cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27810/23513,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Influence of food, storage temperature, and time on the extracorporeal viability of ruminal fluid of cattle","Rumen fluid obtained from slaughter houses is sometimes used for transfaunation. In this study, we evaluated the ruminal fluid of cattle fed on pasture or pasture and concentrate and slaughtered recently. The rumen fluid samples were stored in a water bath, at ambient temperature, cooled, or frozen and subjected to physical, chemical, and microbiological evaluation for 24 h. The color, consistency, and odor changed primarily in the cooled samples, followed by the ambient temperature and water bath samples. The pH of fresh ruminal fluid was 7.5 in the pasture group and 6.4 in the pasture and concentrate group. The methylene blue reduction time of the fresh ruminal fluid was 2.35 min in the pasture group and 1.86 min in the pasture and concentrate group; the best values were observed in the water bath group. The chloride content was 15.7 mEq/l in the pasture group and 16.3±3.6 mEq/l in the pasture and concentrate group. A predominance of gram-negative bacteria was observed. The concentration of protozoa was 51.5 in the pasture group and 47.5 × 104/ml in the pasture and concentrate group, with a slight predominance of small protozoa; motility was better in the water bath samples than in the ambient temperature, cooled, and frozen samples. The viability of ruminal fluid collected from freshly slaughtered cattle was influenced by food provided in vivo; however, changes as a function of time and storage temperature were more remarkable. The rumen fluid was viable for up to 9 h when stored in the water bath (38°C) and 2 h at ambient temperature, and it was observed to be nonviable when subjected to cooling or freezing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28377/23514,E-ISSN 1679-0359

There were no differences on contents non-fibrous carbohydrates (P = 0.356) and acid detergent lignin (P = 0.432). It is recommended the inclusion of licuri cake at level of 240 g kg DM-1 in massai silage, because provided the greatest chemical composition, dry matter intake, digestible dry matter and forage value index.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28536/23515,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Chemical composition and fermentative characteristics of old man saltbush silage supplemented with energy concentrates,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the fermentation profile and chemical composition of old man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia Lindl.) silage supplemented with cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) scraps or grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in the proportion of 10% based on natural matter. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 3 x 7 factorial arrangement (3 treatments and 7 opening days), with three replications. The treatments consisted of three silages: old man saltbush silage, old man saltbush silage + cassava scrap, and old man saltbush silage + grain sorghum. The experiment was conducted at the EMBRAPA Semiarid Animal Nutrition Laboratory, located in the city of Petrolina-PE. Twenty-one experimental silos were used for each treatment; these silos were opened after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days in ensiling. The pH, ammoniacal nitrogen and total nitrogen ratio, dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, mineral matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, total carbohydrates, non-fibrous carbohydrate, and dry matter in vitro digestibility. The additives grain sorghum and cassava scrap increased the dry matter content and reduced pH values. N-NH3 NT-1 values increased as the fermentation processes progressed, and after 56 fermentation days were close to 11%. Silages were classified as excellent in the fermentation process. The addition of cassava scrap and grain sorghum favors the ensiling process of the old man saltbush, providing improvements in the silage nutritive value. During the storage period, the use of these additives promoted a reduction of total losses, inhibition of alcoholic fermentation, and greater carbohydrates recovery, resulting in silage with a nutritive value similar to that of fresh forage, representing an alternative source of additives.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27135/23512,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Marandu were evaluated using the in vitro gas production technique. Ruminal liquid was obtained from two rumen-cannulated Santa Inês sheep maintained on pasture. Accumulated gas production was measured during 96 hours of incubation, measured at 18 different time points. The determined parameters were pH, asymptotic gas production (mL g-1), rate of gas production (h-1), lag time (h), organic matter digestibility (OMD, g g-1 DM), metabolizable energy (ME, MJ kg-1 DM), and neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD, mg g-1 DM). Increasing the FIB dose linearly increased (P < 0.05) the asymptotic gas production. However, the rate of gas production and the lag time showed linear decreases (P < 0.05). Addition of FIB also linearly increased (P < 0.05) the GP at all incubation times, as well as the OMD, NDFD and ME. Addition of AMZ linearly increased (P < 0.05) the asymptotic gas production, but GP linear increased (P < 0.05) only at the 6-hour and 12-hour time points. The rate of gas production and the lag time decreased linearly (P < 0.05) in response to increasing AMZ addition. Inclusion of PRO did not affect (P > 0.05) asymptotic gas production, but there was quadratic effect (P < 0.05) on the rate of gas production, the lag time, and the GP at the 6-hour and 12-hour time points. The OMD, NDFD and ME were not affected by PRO addition. Thus, fibrolytic, amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes are effective in reducing the lag time and increasing the in vitro gas production from Brachiaria Brizantha cv. Marandu forage, and fibrolytic enzymes improve the in vitro fermentation profile.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26962/23511,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Sixty-nine females goats received intravaginal sponges containing 60 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate for seven days and were randomly distributed among three treatments: T1 (n = 23): application of 125 ?g of PGF2? on the sixth day (D6) and 300 UI of eCG on the seventh day (D7), both intramuscularly (IM); T2 (n = 23) and T3 (n = 23): application 37.5 ?g of PGF2? at D6 and 90 UI of eCG at D7, applied by Hou Hai acupuncture and false acupuncture (IM), respectively. The goats were subjected to hormonal protocol and monitored for the coverage and evaluation of reproductive parameters. The data were subjected to normality analysis, followed by appropriate statistical tests for each variable. Greater numbers of estrus goats were obtained in treatments one (T1 = 100%) and three (T3 = 91.3%) (p < 0.05). No difference was observed (p > 0.05) for sponge removal intervals at the beginning (35.9 h) and end (59.8 h) of estrus, and for the duration of estrus (24.7 h), gestation rate at 30 (77%) and 60 (76.7%) days, and prolificacy (1.9). The use of PGF2? and eCG in subdoses applied to the Hou Hai acupoint or false acupoint was efficient in synchronizing estrus in goats, based on the rate of gestation and prolificity of the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31421/23510,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Serological diagnosis and molecular characterization of Leptospira spp. in the blood and urine of bovine females from refrigerated slaughterhouses,"Leptospirosis is an important socioeconomic disease in humans, as well as in domestic and wild animals, being caused by Leptospira spp. Bovine animals are considered reservoirs of this disease, because they intermittently disseminate the bacteria into the environment through their urine. In this way, the cattle an important source of Leptospira infection. The objective of this study was to detect Leptospira spp. antibodies and DNA in bovine females from two refrigerated slaughterhouses in the microregion of Umuarama, Paraná, Brazil. In particular, blood and urine samples from 52 crossbred bovine females older than 36 months from the two slaughterhouses were used. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used to detect leptospiral antibodies, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent sequencing were used to detect Leptospira DNA. The MAT yielded 22 (42.3%) serum samples considered reagent, while the nested PCR test resulted in one amplified sample (1.9%) of 289 bp. This single sample was then amplified again using primers for the SecY gene (549 bp). Sequencing of this gene characterized the bacteria as L. borgpetersenii that were similar to the serovar Hardjo of the genotype Hardjobovis. This is the first molecular confirmation of Hardjobovis-like L. borgpetersenii in the urine of crossbred bovine females older than 36 months from slaughterhouses in the microregion of Umuarama. This study’s results show that it is important to combine serological and molecular diagnosis in the detection of Leptospira spp. Therefore, both methods were used to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of this disease in bovine animals from the microregion of Umuarama. In addition, the analysis informed the subsequent adoption of preventive measures and educational One Health actions to prevent economic losses related to the herd, as well as social losses related to workers and the environment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31127/23509,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Identification of enterobacteria in free-living nonhuman primates in an urban park in the northern Region of the State of Paraná, Brazil","Populations of nonhuman primates are often considered to be a link in the chain of emerging infectious diseases, as they are reservoirs for different zoonotic pathogens. The objective of this study was to identify the presence of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae in free-living nonhuman primates. The research was carried out in an urban park located in a city in the northern region of the State of Paraná, Brazil. The animals were captured in Tomahawk-type traps and chemically restrained, being oral and rectal samples collected with sterile swabs. For bacterial isolation, the samples were seeded on MacConkey agar plates and grown under anaerobic conditions. The subsequent identification was conducted using a commercial biochemical kit. Sixteen primates identified as black-capuchin-monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) were captured. Seven different enterobacterial species were identified from the oral cavity swabs: six Escherichia coli (42.9%), three Kluyvera species (21.40%), one Serratia rubidaea (7.14%), one Enterobacter aerogenes (7.14%), one Enterobacter cloacae (7.14%), one Hafnia alvei (7.14%), and one Erwinia herbicola (7.14%). Seven different species were identified from the rectal swabs: six Escherichia coli (40%), three Kluyvera species (20%), two Enterobacter aerogenes (13.32%), one Erwinia herbicola (6.67%), one Serratia rubidaea (6.67%), one Pragia fontium (6.67%), and one Edwardsiella tarda (6.67%).

39,2018,Cattle tick infestation in Brangus cattle raised with Nellore in central Brazil,"The present study evaluated the behavior of Rhipicephalus microplus naturally infesting Brangus cattle raised with Nellore animals in the municipality of Água Clara, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Central Brazil. For the field experiment composed of a group with 15 Brangus animals and 15 Nellore animals and a control group with 30 Brangus cattle, all at the post-weaning stage. The 2 groups were kept for 6 months in 2 adjacent paddocks, naturally infested with ticks, at a stocking rate of approximately 0.6 of an animal unit per hectare (AU/ha). Every 18 days, the animals were weighed, and ticks on both sides of each bovine were counted. Every 36 days, blood was collected for hematocrit measurement and molecular diagnosis of the 3 pathogens that cause tick fever. The Brangus animals had 6.8 times more ticks than the Nellore cattle. No significant difference was observed in the weight gain of the Brangus and Nellore animals, and no correlation between the number of ticks and weight was observed in either group. During the 6 months of the study, all animals presented normal hematocrit, were positive for Babesia bigemina and Anaplasma marginale, and were negative for Babesia bovis. Animals in Group 1 produced 27% fewer ticks than the animals in Group 2. The production rate of engorged female ticks in Nellore and Brangus cattle was 0.83% and 2.01%, respectively. Considering the infestation pattern required to produce 10 engorged females/day/animal, the Nellore and Brangus animals required 1,204 and 497 larvae/day, respectively. Our estimates showed that Brangus cattle need only 11.3% of the larvae in the pastures with Nellore cattle to maintain the infestation level observed in the present study. Brangus animals raised with Nellore cattle do not have a lower parasitic load and continue to suffer from tick infestation. Finally, Nellore cattle raised with Brangus cattle do not act as a cleaner because this grouping does not contribute to a reduced infestation in the Brangus animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30188/23579,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Bovine cysticercosis: a retrospective survey in the mountainous Region of Santa Catarina State, Brazil","Bovine cysticercosis disease is prevalent worldwide, and is diagnosed frequently in slaughterhouses. This disease has an impact on animal production and public health due to Taenia saginata. In order to investigate the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis in the mountainous region of Santa Catarina state, Brazil, we performed a retrospective survey of beef carcasses that were positive for the parasite. We tabulated and analyzed the records of cattle that were slaughtered from 2003 to 2013, under the state inspection in Lages, Santa Catarina. These records were provided by Companhia Integrada de Desenvolvimento Agrícola de Santa Catarina (CIDASC). The data were analyzed using Chi-square test (P ? 0.05) to correlate the cysticerci occurrence with the independent variables. The animals were from the 18 municipalities that represent Associação dos Municípios da Região Serrana (AMURES). Among the animals that were slaughtered during the study period, 7.06% (1698/24055) were confirmed positive for cysticercosis during the visual inspection. Among the total cysts that were inspected, 25.79% and 74.20% were classified as viable and calcified, respectively. The most frequently parasitized organs were the head, with 876 cases (51.59%) positive for cysticerci (321 [36.64%] viable and 555 [63.36%] nonviable) and the heart with 641 cases (37.75%) positive for cysticerci (54 [8.42%] viable and 587 [91.58%] non-viable). In addition to the generalized infection (4.48%), the tongue and the diaphragm were the next most commonly parasitized organs, with 3.71% and 2.47% cases positive for cysticerci, respectively. There was no correlation (P > 0.05) between sex or age, and positive infection or cyst location. We identified statistical variations among the results for each of the evaluated years (P < 0.01). These reports indicated a significant increase in the infection rate over time, from 4.58% (2005) to 9.94% (2013). We analyzed the correlation (P < 0.01) between the occurrence of cysticercosis and the origin of the animals as well as between the viability of cysts and their location in the body. These results suggest that the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis in the mountainous region of Santa Catarina is high and at an alarming rate. Bovine cysticercosis can lead to an economic loss and can endanger public health. Therefore, government agencies need to plan and implement measures in order to control this disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29976/23578,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The use of acaricides at strategic times and selection of resistant animals can minimize economic losses. This study aimed to determine the anatomical distribution and population dynamics of R. microplus in the municipality of Óleo, state of São Paulo. This study was conducted using eight male cattle, crossbred zebu-taurine (in accordance with the regional herd). Female R. (B.) microplus, greater than 4 mm, present in the right side of the animals were counted between April 2012 and March 2013. The highest tick number per animal was noted in October (128.25), and the lowest in April (35.5), with three infestation peaks during the study, in May, October, and December, which were influenced by the minimum and maximum mean temperature and rainfall. Among the cranio-caudal regions (anterior, median, and posterior), the posterior had the highest mean tick number, and the anterior had the lowest. The minimum temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation interfered with infestation of dorsoventral regions: in cold months, the lowest infestations were found in the mixed area (ear and tail); in the warm months, in the high region (head, neck, upper ribs, flank, and rump). The lower region (dewlap, cranial limb, lower ribs, abdomen, prepuce, scrotum, and lower limb) always had the highest mean tick number. The tick numbers of the caudal limb and crotch showed strong correlation with the total tick number (+0.88 and +0.70, respectively). These data, grouped according to median, posterior, and crotch regions, showed a stronger correlation with the total tick number (+0.96, +0.90, and +0.70, respectively).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29916/23504,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Seroprevalence of caseous lymphadenitis in goats sold in an animal fair in the northeastern semi-arid region of Brazil,"Goat farming in the northeastern regions of Brazil plays an important role in the socio-economic functions of the country. However, high rates of morbidity and mortality occur in the animals, caused primarily by infectious diseases like caseous lymphadenitis, which is widespread in goat herds; this causes serious economic losses to the farming business. Although events such as animal fairs are common in the region, wherein most of the goats and sheep are sold, the risk of disease transmission remains, since the health condition of the animal is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of anti-Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis antibodies present in the goats sold at the animal fair of Tabira - PE, Northeastern semi-arid. Serum samples from 233 goats were collected from the period of November 2014 to June 2015. The diagnosis of infection by C. pseudotuberculosis was made using the indirect ELISA technique. The number of goats seropositive for C. pseudotuberculosis was identified as 87 (37.34%; 95% CI = 31.38 - 43.71%). Of the nine flocks evaluated, five (55.55%) were positive. Thus, it is suggested that infection by C. pseudotuberculosis is widespread in the goats sold at the animal fairs in the semi-arid Northeastern, reinforcing the need for disease diagnosis in goat herds in the region for the possible implementation of disease control programs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29279/25435,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Molecular diagnosis of Ehrlichia canis infection in dogs with uveitis,"Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium Ehrlichia canis that has a high global prevalence that leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Among the clinical changes, ophthalmic diseases can lead to permanent blindness and it can be an important clinical sign. The objective of this study was to perform nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to diagnose E. canis infection in dogs with bilateral uveitis from the Veterinary Hospital of the Santa Cruz State University. Blood samples were collected and DNA for the molecular diagnosis was extracted from 66 adult dogs of both genders and mixed breeds diagnosed with bilateral uveitis. Thirty-five (53%) dogs showed positive results and presented with iridocyclitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, or uveitis with secondary glaucoma. This study demonstrates that nested PCR is an important tool for the differential diagnosis of dogs with bilateral uveitis, as it provides evidence of the infectious agent in the animal.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28704/23501,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Metabolites able to predict uterine diseases in crossbred dairy cows during the transition period,"This study aimed to identify possible metabolites able to predict puerperal uterine diseases in crossbred dairy cows (Holstein x Gir) in the transition period. We hypothesized that, as what has been observed for Holstein cows, a negative energy balance (NEB) may increase the incidence of uterine diseases. Thirty-four lactating crossbred cows (½HG, ¼HG, ¾HG, and 5/8HG) were evaluated during prepartum (-60d and -30d), calving, and postpartum (+14d, +21d, and +35d) periods, being divided into two groups (with and without uterine diseases). NEB evaluations were based on the concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) at calving and 14 days postpartum. Nearly 1/3 of the crossbred cows presented an NEB, characterized by a significant increase in NEFA with no BHBA increase; however, it was less intense than that observed in Holstein cows during the transition period. There was a significant difference between cows with and without uterine diseases in NEFA and calcium concentrations at partum, as well as body condition score (BCS) during prepartum. In conclusion, the occurrence of uterine diseases during the transitional period is related to the BCS in the prepartum period, besides serum NEFA and calcium concentrations at partum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27241/23500,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Occurrence and risk factors of zoonoses in dogs and owners in Sertão, Paraíba State, Northeastern Brazil","Seropositivity and risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and leptospirosis were investigated in 200 dogs and twenty-three owners in a municipality with a history of human cases of visceral leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis in the region of Sertão, Paraíba State, Northeastern Brazil. In dogs, frequencies of 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7-9.3%), 7.5% (95% CI = 3.8-11.2%), 18% (95% CI = 12.7-23.3%), and 14% (95% CI = 9.2-18.8%) were found for visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and leptospirosis, respectively. An age of over 72 months and environment conditions (soil) were identified as risk factors for Leishmania chagasi infection. Free housing was identified as risk factor for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. For toxoplasmosis, free housing and contact with cats were found to be risk factors, while commercial food was a risk factor for leptospirosis. Of the twenty-three owners who agreed to participate in the study, eight were tested for leishmaniasis, three for Chagas disease, nine for toxoplasmosis, eleven for leptospirosis, and five were tested for more than one disease. Only anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were found in the human population at a frequency of 44.4% (4/9); for all other diseases, all individuals were negative. The results indicate that such zoonoses are present in dogs from the studied region, but only toxoplasmosis was found in the owners. Our risk analysis suggests that cleaner soil, better storage of dog food, and avoiding free housing can reduce the risk of infection by these diseases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29199/23502,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Salmonella Heidelberg resistant to ceftiofur and disinfectants routinely used in poultry,"Bacteria of the genus Salmonella may infect humans and domestic animals, causing a serious public health problem worldwide. Nowadays, Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (SH) is among the top three serovars isolated from people with salmonellosis and it is present in the poultry production chain. Moreover, it seems to be more invasive than other serotypes that cause enteritis. The overall status of the antimicrobial resistant of Brazilian strains of SH is still unknow. The bacterium may use similar mechanisms of resistance to antibotics, as well as disinfectants such as the efflux system and enzymatic degradation of chemical compounds. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for ceftiofur of SH isolated from different materials of poultry origin, as well as to verify the relation between antibiotic resistance and disinfectant resistance. In addition, the screening efflux system was performed, using ethidium bromide to determine the presence of this mechanism of resistance. MIC results indicated high levels of SH resistance to ceftiofur, indicating the need for alternative drugs to treat salmonellosis. The concentration of ceftiofur needed to eliminate SH resistant isolates were 32 times higher than the therapeutic dose. Regarding disinfectants, most of the disinfectants tested were efficient to eliminate SH, however one isolate was resistant to glutaraldehyde-quaternary ammonia. All isolates were negatives in the screening efflux system, which suggest a different mechanism of resistance. It is possible to conclude that SH shows a real threat to poultry production, and caution should be taken when choosing the right antibiotic and disinfectant against this serovar.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28417/25434,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nitrogen fertilization in the contents of secondary compounds in cassava cultivars,"The production of chemical substances is a strategy of plants to defend against the attack of pest insects. The synthesis of secondary compounds in plants is influenced by genotype and cultural management, such as the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Thus, the objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of doses of nitrogen fertilizer over time on the production of secondary compounds in two industrial cassava cultivars. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse (25 ± 5 °C) of Embrapa Soybean in Londrina, Paraná, with the cultivation of potted plants (4l) in a 2 × 4 × 3 factorial scheme, with five replications. Two genotypes of industrial cassava (‘Baianinha’ and ‘Caiuá’) and four different nitrogen doses (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg ha-1) were used, with sampling at 15, 30, and 45 d after fertilization. Nitrogen fertilization was performed 50 d after sprouting. In the apical leaves, the levels of rutin, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were evaluated in a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Exploratory analyses were performed on the data variables to verify the assumptions for analysis of variance (ANOVA), such as the independence and normality of errors, homogeneity of treatment variances and non-additivity of the model (they were submitted to analysis of homogeneity and normality, respectively. After these tests, ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p ? 0.05) were performed. For the quantitative data concerning the N rates, regression study analyzes were performed. The Caiuá cultivar was found to have a higher ferulic acid content. The caffeic acid content decreased over time after the application of N in both cultivars. The rutin content in both cultivars did not increase with an increase in nitrogen dose.

39,2018,Changes in the stocks of C and N in organic matter fractions in soil cropped with coffee and fertilized with sunn hemp and ammonium sulfate,"Despite the potential to provide N to crops, the rapid incorporation of green manure nutrients into stable fractions of organic matter in the soil (SOM) may reduce the efficiency of green manuring. Thus, the objective of this work was to characterize the changes of C and N stocks in fractions of SOM cultivated with coffee (Coffea arabica L.) and fertilized with sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and ammonium sulfate. To study the changes in organic C (OC) and total N (TN) in soil and fractions of SOM over time, soil samples were collected in the 0–5 and 5–10 cm layers, with the initial sampling done prior to the application of sunn hemp residues and ammonium sulfate. Five samples were collected every 2 months after the application of the legume and ammonium sulfate. The soil samples were submitted to densimetric and granulometric fractionation, obtaining the free light organic matter (F-LOM), particulate organic matter (POM), and organic matter associated with minerals (MAM). OC and TN stocks were then determined in soil and the SOM fractions. The changes in the stocks of OC (?StcC) in the soil in relation to time zero were positive in the evaluations carried out in the two layers. The fractions of SOM showed positive ?StcC at almost all of the evaluated times. The N supplied to the soil in the form of mineral and organic fertilizer promoted an increase of 0.24 Mg ha-1 of N in the 0–5 cm layer until after 60 days. Of this total, 0.03 Mg ha-1 was associated with F-LOM, 0.07 Mg ha-1 with POM, and the remainder was associated with MAM. Nearly 60% of the N that was supplied to the soil was drawn to the stable fractions of the SOM, indicating a rapid stabilization of this nutrient in the most recalcitrant organic compartments. Despite that, the variations in N stocks of MAM became smaller over time, and eventually became negative, in relation to time zero. This indicates the mineralization of N of this compartment. In the 5–10 cm layer, no effect of time was observed in the soil TN, N-POM, or N-MAM stocks. Additionally, under the conditions of this experiment, the majority of the N supplied to the soil was rapidly incorporated into the most stable fraction of SOM, and this might can reduced the efficiency of the green manuring.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30582/23497,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nutrient accumulation in the shoots of physic nut grown in two edaphoclimatic conditions,"The possibility of using physic nut oil as an alternative energy source indicates that it is necessary to carry out studies concerning the absorption and accumulation of nutrients in the distinct phases of development of the crop for the appropriate management of fertilizer application. Given this information, this study aimed to evaluate the accumulation of nutrients in the shoots of physic nut plants, as well as to identify critical nutrient uptake by this crop. The experiments were set up independently in two different locations, from May 2010 to March 2013, and using the same procedures. The locations were characterized as follows: dystrophic Red Latosol in the municipality of Curvelo, MG; typical Quartzarenic Neosol in the municipality of Diamantina, MG. The experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with three replicates, the treatments being the evaluation times of the physic nut plants in both experiments. The collection times were every 30 days from planting of the seedlings in the field for a period of 1036 days, corresponding to 36 evaluations. After collection, the samples were prepared and submitted to chemical analysis of the nutrient content of the plant material. The contents were reported as nutrient content of the leaves, stems and fruit of physic nut plants. According to the results, it can be concluded that nutrient accumulation was higher in the edaphoclimatic conditions of Curvelo compared to the conditions of Diamantina. The concentration of macronutrients was in the following order: K > Ca > N > P > S > Mg in Diamantina and N > Ca > K > P > Mg > S in Curvelo. Accumulation of micronutrients in the shoots at 1036 days after planting physic nut seedlings in the field was in the following order: Mn > B > Fe > Zn > Cu in Diamantina and Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu in Curvelo.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30307/23496,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Changes in microbiological attributes of a red latosol under different cropping systems,"The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in microbiological attributes of soils under different growing systems. Three cropping systems were evaluated (1) no-tillage system (NTS); (2) conventional tillage system (CTS); and (3) newly scarified no-tillage system (SNTS). The three systems were maintained for 20 years. In addition, a primary forest (PF) fragment was used as a reference. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0.0-0.1 m, 0.1-0.2 m, and 0.2-0.3 m. The following variables were measured: microbial biomass carbon (MBC); soil respirometry (RESP) using the fumigation and incubation method; microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) using fumigation and extraction; metabolic quotient (qCO2) using the RESP-MBC ratio; and number of spores (NS) of mycorrhizal fungi by plate counting of spores extracted from the soil by wet sieving. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with five replicates. The different management systems affected the soil microbiota, especially in the superficial layer of 0.0-0.1 m. At a depth of 0.0-0.2 m, the PF presented significantly higher values for all analyzed attributes, except for NS. There were no significant differences in the studied characteristics between the NTS and SNTS at the three depths, indicating that scarification performed only once in the NTS was not sufficient to produce changes in soil microbiological attributes. However, the adoption of the CTS for 20 years promoted a decrease in MBC and MBN. RESP and NS were not significantly different between the cropping systems. Principal component analysis indicated a significant difference in microbiological characteristics between the PF and the areas under management. Therefore, different growing systems change the soil microbiota, and the lower the degree of tilling (NTS and SNTS), the smaller the changes in soil microbiological attributes. Soil preparation practices used in conventional tilling negatively affect soil microbial biomass, decreasing the levels of MBC and MBN.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30009/23534,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Production of lettuce with brackish water in NFT hydroponic system,"Groundwater reserves in the semi-arid regions, which are mostly brackish, could be used to meet local water demands. Hydroponic cultivation is an alternative of rational use of water. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the technical feasibility of using brackish groundwater in the semi-arid region of Bahia and Recôncavo of Bahia for hydroponic production of curly lettuce cv. ‘Verônica’ and purple lettuce cv. ‘Quatro Estações’. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in the city of Cruz das Almas, Bahia State, in a randomized block experimental design, composed of seven treatments [T1- public-supply water; T2- water from the well of UFRB; T3- reject water from the well of Cruz das Almas; T4- water from the well of Sapeaçu; T5- reject water from the well of Sapeaçu; T6- reject water from the well of Conceição do Coité and T7- artificially salinated water (NaCl)] and six replicates in an experimental hydroponic structure using the nutrient film technique (NFT). The following variables were analyzed: number of leaves, shoot fresh matter, shoot length, root length, shoot dry matter, and root dry matter. Relative shoot dry matter production in curly lettuce increased by 1, 5, and 2% in the treatments T2, T3, and T4, respectively, whereas in purple lettuce, the increments were 10, 1, and 20%, respectively, for the same treatments. The use of brackish groundwater from the deep tubular wells of the Federal University of Recôncavo da Bahia and Sapeaçu and desalination reject water from the tubular well of Cruz das Almas proved to be technically feasible for hydroponic lettuce production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28810/23492,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Thermodynamic properties of water desorption in lettuce seeds,"Knowledge of the movement of water molecules inside material is important for the study of interactions between water and chemical components of agricultural products. The thermodynamic properties calculation reports this need, being the source of information to design drying equipment, calculate the energy required in this process and evaluate the physical phenomena that occur on the food surface. Given the importance of the subject, the objective of this study was to determine the thermodynamic properties of the water desorption process in lettuce seeds. Lettuce seeds had an initial moisture content of 9.3% (d.b.). The equilibrium moisture content of seeds was determined by static gravimetric method at different temperatures (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ± 1 °C) and relative humidity values (between 11 and 96%). Experiments were conducted in triplicate. It was observed that, with increasing equilibrium moisture content, there was a reduction in the energy required for evaporation of water in lettuce seeds, with values of integral isosteric heat of desorption in the water content range 2.1 to 21.2% (d.b.) which varied from ‘4164.89 to 2477.43’ kJ kg-1. With increasing equilibrium moisture content there was a decrease in differential entropy, resulting in lower demand for mobility of water molecules. The Gibbs free energy also decreased with increasing equilibrium moisture content and was positive for all temperatures studied, showing non-spontaneity of water desorption in the seeds. The enthalpy-entropy compensation theory was has been satisfactorily applied to the sorption phenomenon and the water desorption process in lettuce seeds was controlled by enthalpy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28421/23490,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of increasing rate of insecticides on its selectivity for Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae),"The present study evaluated the effect of different rates of chlorantraniliprole, chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin, spinosad, and chlorfenapyr on their selectivity for the pupae and adults of Trichogramma pretiosum. The negative effect of majority of the insecticides tested on most of the parasitoids was directly proportional to the rate of the insecticide applied. Chlorantraniliprole at a rate of 10 g a.i. ha-1 was classified as harmless (class 1) to both pupae and adults of the parasitoid. The effect of chlorantraniliprole at a rate of 20 to 50 g a.i. ha-1 varied from harmless (class 1) to slightly harmful (class 2) to the adults of T. pretiosum. Chlorantraniliprole 10 + lambda-cyhalothrin at 5 g a.i. ha-1 was classified as harmless (class 1) to the pupae and moderately harmful (class 3) to the adults of T. pretiosum. On the contrary, the highest rate of chlorantraniliprole 50 + lambda-cyhalothrin tested (i.e., 25 g a.i. ha-1) was classified as slightly harmful (class 2) to the pupae and harmful (class 4) to the adults of the parasitoid. Similarly, increasing the application rate of spinosad and chlorfenapyr also exhibited an increase in toxicity. Spinosad at a rate of 24 g a.i. ha-1 was classified as slightly harmful (class 2) and harmless (class 1) to the pupae and adults of T. pretiosum, respectively. Spinosad at 96 g a.i. ha-1 was classified as both moderately harmful (class 3) and harmful (class 4) to the pupae of the parasitoid. Chlorfenapyr at a rate of 192 g a.i. ha-1 was classified as both slightly harmful (class 2) and moderately harmful (class 3) to the pupae of T. pretiosum, whereas chlorfenapyr at 336 g a.i. ha-1 was categorized as slightly harmful (class 3) and harmful (class 4) to the pupae. These results indicate that an increase in the rate of insecticide affected T. pretiosum negatively. Therefore, higher insecticide rates should only be adopted when strictly necessary to control the target pest, because they might compromise the biological pest control process in the field.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28656/23491,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Spatial distribution of nymphs and adults of Euschistus heros (Fabricius, 1794) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) in transgenic soybean cultivars of different maturing cycles","The neotropical stink bug Euschistus heros is the predominant and most important insect pest affecting soybean cultivation. Knowledge of the spatial pattern of the pest in an area is critical to understanding its behavior. The objective of this work was to study the spatial distribution of E. heros in transgenic soybean cultivars of different maturing cycles. The experiments were conducted in the seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15 in FCAV/UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP. Three fields were selected, and each was marked an area of 8.000 m2 (0.8 ha), with each area divided into 80 portions of 100 m2 (10 m x 10 m). The transgenic soybean cultivars of different maturing cycles were: SYN 1365 RR (early), M 7908 RR (average), and BRS Valiosa RR (late). Samples were taken weekly using a beat sheet, registering the number of nymphs and adults of E. heros. To study the dispersion of E. heros, the following indices were used: variance/mean ratio, Morisita index, Green coefficient, and the exponent k of the negative binomial distribution. For studies of special distribution models of E. heros, adjustments of Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution were tested. The spatial distribution of nymphs and adults was aggregated for all the cultivars studied, indicating that cultivars did not alter the distribution behavior of E. heros.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28404/23489,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Economic losses associated with Wooden Breast and White Striping in broilers,"Currently, two defects in poultry breasts termed Wooden Breast (WB) and White Striping (WS) have been reported in slaughterhouses. These defects may be associated with the accelerated growth of the birds, management, density in the aviary, and both weight and age at slaughter. Although the health of the affected birds is not impaired, these myopathies cause carcass condemnation and economic losses to slaughterhouses, since the breasts of these chickens, considered to be prime cuts in the poultry industry, have to be discarded. This paper reports on the economic losses and factors associated with carcass condemnation caused by white striping (WS) and wooden breast (WB) in broilers from a federally inspected slaughterhouse. Twelve flocks, totaling 207,000 slaughtered broilers, were assessed as to weight and age at slaughter, and stocking density and carcass condemnations due to these two myopathies were also evaluated. Economic losses were estimated by the price of poultry breast at the firm level, around U$ 19,12 per kilo, amounting to daily losses of up to U$ 70,632.00, given that approximately 0.8% of the chicken breasts were condemned. Heavier broilers had a larger condemnation rate due to WS and WB, and so did those reared at a smaller density, due probably to their better access to water and feed, which contributed to weight gain and consequent condemnation, resulting in losses that could affect the entire poultry sector.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28864/23223,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Chemical composition of the essential oil of Psidium guajava leaves and its toxicity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,"Globally, the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is considered as one of the most important phytopathogens, since it affects the production of several economically important crops. Further, it is difficult to control, thus increasing the use of pesticides. Therefore, the search for new substances, especially those extracted from plants, has received special attention to control this plant pathogen. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the yield and chemical composition of the essential oil extracted from the fresh leaves of guava collected during the rainy and dry seasons, and also to evaluate its toxicity against S. sclerotiorum. The experiment was a completely randomized design with five treatments and six replicates. The essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation of the leaves and analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified in the essential oil were trans-caryophyllene and ?-humulene. The essential oil at a concentration of 300 ?L exhibited 90% inhibition of the mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum. This confirmed the antifungal potential of the essential oil of the guava leaves during both the sampling seasons.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27652/23304,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Ruminal degradability of tropical leguminous plants from eastern Amazonia,"The aim of this study was to evaluate ruminal degradation of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of Cratylia argentea, Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merrill, and Stylosanthes guianensis ‘Campo Grande’ (EMBRAPA), aged 55 and 75 days, in sheep with rumen cannulas, using the in-situ technique. A factorial design of 3 leguminous plants × 2 ages × 6 incubation times was used, totaling 36 experimental units. The experimental period included 14 days for adaptation to diet and 5 days for data collection. Cratylia at both ages and Flemingia aged 55 days showed the highest “a” fraction values for DM degradability. Cratylia aged 55 days and Stylosanthes at both ages showed the highest “a” fraction values for CP. The highest “b” fraction value for DM was 51.27% for Stylosanthes aged 55 days. This rate was lower for the other leguminous plants, especially for Flemingia at both ages. The “b” fraction values for NDF are considered low for Flemingia, what may be the result of lower ruminal degradation. The highest “c” fraction degradation rate for DM was observed in all leguminous plants studied aged 75 days. The highest “c” fraction value for CP was 14.84% for Stylosanthes aged 75 days. The highest Kd fraction values for DM, NDF, and CP were found in Flemingia. Cratylia, and Stylosanthes aged 75 days presented higher effective degradability (ED) values for DM at 2 and 5%/hour compared to Flemingia at both ages. Cratylia and Stylosanthes had the highest ED values for NDF, regardless of their passage rates. Stylosanthes presented higher ED values for CP at both ages, regardless of its passage rate. The highest DM, NDF, and CP potential degradability (PD) was obtained for Cratylia and Stylosanthes, at both ages. The leguminous plants Cratylia and Stylosanthes can be recommended for use as a protein bank and supplementation for ruminants, whereas, Flemingia macrophylla should not be used as a protein supplement for ruminants, because it contains high levels of fibrous fractions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30775/23218,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Compatibility of Azospirillum brasilense with fungicide and insecticide and its effects on the physiological quality of wheat seeds,"Seed treatment is a practice that helps the initial establishment of the crop without the effects caused by pests and diseases. The association of diazotrophic bacteria with grasses has been used in the supply of nitrogen to plants; however, these microorganisms produce growth-promoting substances, which promote benefits in the growth and development of the crops. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of Azospirillum brasilense associated with the fungicide difenoconazole and the insecticide thiamethoxam by observing the effects on the quality of seed emergence of three wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.). Three wheat cultivars, arranged in a 4 x 2 factorial system with four replicates, were tested. The treatments were the control; difenoconazole (Spectro® at a dose of 150 mL per 100 kg of seed); thiamethoxam (Cruiser® FS 350 at a dose of 200 mL per 100 kg seed) and difenoconazole + thiamethoxam, applied on wheat cultivars TBIO Mestre, TBIO Itaipu and TBIO Sinuelo. Bacteria from the Azospirillum genus were used in the inoculation. The wheat seed retains its quality when it checks the germination, vigor and independent accelerated aging, whether or not fungicide, insecticide and A. brasilense were used. The insecticide thiamethoxam increased the length of shoots and roots and provided compatibility with A. brasilense, and fungicide inhibited the length of shoots and roots and was antagonistic to the bacterium A. brasilense.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26164/23219,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The design was completely randomized, with four treatments and ten replicates. Each box contained 40 birds (male), totaling 1600 Cobb Slow birds. Treatments consisted of two sorghum-based diets, one with DSO (SSO) another with CCOHA (SCO), and two corn-based diets, one with DSO (CSO) another with CCOHA (CCO). At 30 days of age, a digestibility test was performed using total excreta collection to determine apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and nitrogen-corrected AME (AMEn) from test rations. At 42 days of age, we evaluated live weight (LW), feed intake (FI), feed conversion (FC), carcass yield (CY), and the yields of breast with bone and skin (BWBS), skinless boneless breast (SBB), thigh (T), drumstick (D), and wing (W), as well as breast centesimal composition. Neither corn nor sorghum-based diets with CCOHA showed differences between AME and AMEn. Both DSO and CCOHA diets showed no differences in LW, FI, FC, carcass and cuts yields when using CCOHA. Regarding breast composition, no differences in dry matter and in the levels of crude protein, fat, and mineral matter were observed. We may conclude that CCOHA had no effect on the performance variables, carcass and cuts yields, and broiler meat quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29872/23215,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity in collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) seminal plasma and their relation to sperm quality,"The study of the seminal plasma help us to understand the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect the sperm. The antioxidant enzymes, as the superoxide dismutase - SOD and catalase - CAT, are capable of removing the oxidative agents before they produce injuries. The aim of the current study was to investigate the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT in seminal plasma, and their association with sperm quality in collared peccaries. Study was conducted during the dry period (August and September) on a region characterized by a semiarid climate, with an average annual temperature of 27°C and irregular rainfall (Mossoro, RN, Brazil; 5°10´S and 37°10´W). Nine ejaculates were obtained from sexually mature males (1 sample per animal) by electroejaculation. Semen was evaluated for microscopic parameters and the activity of SOD and CAT was measured by spectrophotometry. All ejaculates were white in color. Mean values for concentration were of 207 ± 160 x106 sperm/mL, motility of 83.0 ± 20.9% and viability of 72.5 ± 10.4%. In regards to the enzymatic activity, none was observed for the CAT enzyme. Trace levels of SOD (0.034 ± 0.049 AU/mgP) were detected in the ejaculates of all individuals; however, no correlation was observed between SOD levels and the sperm motility (R = 0.35; P = 0.931), vigor (R = 0.29; P = 0.133), viability (R = 0.16; P = 0.29), functional membrane (R = 0.04; P = 0.617) or morphology (R = 0.03; P = 0.637). In conclusion, we demonstrated the first description of antioxidant enzyme activity in seminal plasma of fresh ejaculates obtained from collared peccaries. SOD antioxidant activity was evident during the dry period of a semi-arid region, but no relationship between SOD and semen parameters was observed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29761/23212,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nutritional value and physical and chemical characteristics of white mulberry tree using different conservation methods for ruminant feed,"This study was carried out to evaluate the white mulberry tree (Morus alba) as a feedstuff for ruminants in natura, as hay and as silage. A completely randomized design with five treatments and three replicates was used, where the treatments were five types of mulberry forage: (1) in natura after cutting; (2) hay; (3) silage of mulberry in natura; (4) silage of wilted mulberry and (5) silage of mulberry with ground ear corn. The content of crude protein (CP) did not differ between the silages (average of 19.03% of dry matter - DM). The CP content of the silages was higher than in mulberry hay (15.26% DM) and similar to mulberry after cutting (17.00% DM). The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content did not differ between the silages (34.84% DM on average), but the NDF of silage with ear corn was lower than the mulberry hay (33.77 vs. 39.36% DM). The acid detergent fiber (ADF) content did not differ between silages and mulberry hay (30.66% DM on average). The lowest value for ADF was observed in the mulberry after cutting (26.06% DM). The aerobic stability of the silages was not broken during the seven days of aerobic exposure. The pH of silage of mulberry in natura was similar to silage of wilted mulberry (4.80 on average), while the silage with ear corn showed a lower pH value (4.58) compared to the other silages. The buffering capacity (BC) did not differ between the silage with ear corn and silage of wilted mulberry (84.91 meq 100 g DM-1 on average), while a lower value was observed for silage of mulberry in natura (56.69 meq 100 g DM-1). The highest value for ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) was demonstrated in the silage of mulberry in natura (13.08% total N), and the lowest values were observed in the silage with ear corn and silage of wilted mulberry (7.49 and 9.58% total N, respectively). Silage with 11% of ground ear corn is the best alternative use of white mulberry tree as forage for ruminant feeding, since this form presented low fiber content and a fermentative pattern suitable for the process of forage conservation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29243/23227,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Dehydrated cashew apple meal in the feeding of growing rabbits,"Two trials were conducted aiming to determine the chemical composition, the digestibility of nutrients and energy from dehydrated cashew apple meal, as well as to evaluate the effects generated by including increasing levels (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%) of this ingredient in growing rabbit feed, on performance, carcass characteristics and economic evaluation. In the digestibility trial, were used 24 rabbits with 55 days of age, distributed in a completely randomized design with two treatments and twelve repetitions, being one reference feed and the other test feed, composed by 70% of the reference feed and 30% DCAM. The coefficients of the dry matter digestibility, crude protein and gross energy of the DCAM were, respectively, 67.79; 30.03 and 48.61%. The digestible dry matter, digestible protein and digestible energy, based on dry matter, were, respectively, 59.55%; 4.76% and 2,119.66 kcal/kg. In the second trial, 120 mixed breed rabbits were used, with an average of 45 days of age and weight 1143 ± 153g. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design, with six treatments and ten repetitions with two rabbits of the same sex per cage. It was observed that the inclusion of DCAM did not affect (P > 0.05) the feed intake, but reduced (P < 0.05) the feed conversion efficiency, as well as a linear reduction in carcass yield. A quadratic effect on daily weight gain and the ratio meat/bone was observed, with better inclusion level estimated at 25.31 and 24.65%, respectively. The inclusion of DCAM linearly improved economic viability to the level of 50%, however not to harm the weight gain and the ratio meat/bone, it is recommended to include up to 25%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29184/23210,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Productive features of broiler chickens in hot weather: effects of strain and sex,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of broiler strains (Cobb 500, Ross 308, and Hubbard Flex) in hot weather. Environmental temperatures above thermal comfort trigger responses of the animals to maintain homeothermia, which negatively affects productive performance. A total of 2,160 chicks of both sexes, were distributed in an experimental design that was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement of 3 × 2 (strains and sexes) with six replicates of 60 birds each. Feed intake (FI), live weight (LW), weight gain (WG), and feed conversion (FC) were analyzed at periods of 1–7, 1–21, 1–28, 1–42, and 1–49 days old. At 42 and 49 days old, the carcass weight (CW), carcass yield (CY), breast yield (BY), thigh yield (TY), and drumstick yield (DY) were analyzed. The strains differed in LW and WG in most periods, especially for Cobb broilers in the pre-start period (1–7 days) and Hubbard broilers in the last two periods (1–42 and 1–49 days). Except for the pre-initial stage, which there was no influence of the strains on FC, the Hubbard broilers showed the best FC, at 1–49 d, similarly to Cobb broilers. Regardless of strain, the males showed superior performance to that of females. At 42 d, the Cobb broilers showed a superior BY to that of the other strains, presenting better TY than did the Ross and Hubbard strains. At 49 d, the Cobb and Ross strains showed the best BY, with the Hubbard strain having the greatest DY. Males showed higher values in cut yields, except in the BY in which females showed better results.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28919/23238,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Quantitative analysis of the beef cattle industry in the state of Pará, Brazil","The state of Pará has the fifth largest cattle herd in Brazil at 20.3 million heads, and beef cattle breeding accounts for 44.32% of the agricultural production value. Using a recursive econometric model estimated by the generalized method of moments, we evaluated the effects of variables that define the supply and demand of slaughtered beef cattle from 1990 to 2015. The results showed that supply and demand were inelastic to prices. Increases in rural salary and calf prices negatively affected supply, and the response to rural credit applications occurred with a four-year lag due to the biological and technological characteristics of production systems. Deforestation tended to increase the supply of cattle and slaughterhouses appropriated the largest share of the economic surplus generated. There were productivity gains since the early 1990s, with the yield of slaughtered animals was 230.55 kg for cattle and 182.25 kg for cows, while currently, it is 276 and 202.5 kg, respectively.

Ninety-six commercial hybrid piglets (Topigs Norsvin, 46 castrated males and 50 females) that had been weaned at 28 d of age with an initial body weight of 8.82 ± 0.28 kg were distributed in a randomized block design composed of four treatments, with eight replicates per treatment and three animals per replicate. The treatments were as follows: PF1, SID Lys levels of 1.05, 0.95, and 0.85%; PF 2, SID Lys levels of 1.15, 1.05, and 0.95%; PF 3, SID Lys levels of 1.25, 1.15, and 1.05%; and PF 4, SID Lys levels of 1.35, 1.25, and 1.15% from 28 to 35, 36 to 49, and 50 to 63 d of age, respectively. From 28 to 63 d of age, the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG) were not affected by the SID Lys levels tested; however, final body weight (fBW) was affected, with PF1 having the lowest fBW. The SID Lys levels tested had a significant effect on the feed conversion ratio (FCR), which varied linearly from 28 to 35 d of age. In the period from 28 to 63 d of age, pigs fed PF4 had the highest FCR results. The protein deposition ratio (PDR) was also affected by the SID Lys levels tested, with PF3 and PF4 having the highest PDR results. Therefore, the optimal SID Lys requirement for nursery pigs from 28 to 35 d of age that provided better performance results was 1.25%, corresponding to a daily Lys intake of 4.13 g/d. PF3 provided the best performance and PDR results for piglets from 28 to 63 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28614/23207,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,The effect of exogenous enzymes on the performance and digestibility of nutrients in broiler,"Here we tested how feeding with exogenous enzymes affects the performance, carcass yield, and ileal digestibility in broilers from 21- to 42-days-old. The study included 1008 male broilers randomly distributed into six diets: positive control (PC), corn and soybean meal containing all the nutritional requirements; negative control (NC), with a 120 kcal.kg-1 reduction in metabolizable energy relative to the PC; enzyme complex one (NC + 100 ppm of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase); enzyme complex two (NC + 200 ppm of xylanase, amylase and protease); enzyme blend one (NC + 100 FXU kg-1 of xylanase and 200 FXU kg-1 of amylase); and enzyme blend two (NC + 100 FXU kg-1 of xylanase and 300 FXU kg-1 of amylase). The enzyme complex two (CN + 100 FXU.kg de xilanase e 300 FXU.kg de amilase) and enzyme blend two (NC + 100 FXU kg-1 of xylanase and 300 FXU kg-1 of amylase) had greater weight gain, feed conversion, carcass yield, and digestibility of nutrients than the NC (P < 0,05). We found that enzyme complex two and enzyme blend two valued their nutritional matrix promoting better performance and digestibility of broilers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28533/23206,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Growth performance and safety of meat from cattle feedlot finished with monensin in the ration,"Monensin is an ionophore antibiotic, the inclusion of which in the feed of beef cattle favors the best use of feed nutrients, via ruminal modulation. However, there are concerns regarding the residence of residues in the carcass from metabolism of monensin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the productive performance, carcass characteristics, serum parameters, tissue residual depletion and economic benefit of finishing of young bulls in confinement with monensin in the ration. Thirty-six animals were confined, and given 50% corn silage feed and 50% more concentrated feed. The experimental design was completely randomized, with two treatments (with or without monensin) and 10 replicates for the control group and eight for the monensin group. The use of monensin reduced the dry matter intake in relation to live weight (2.36% vs 2.55%), and improved feed conversion (8.61 vs 10.06 kg kg?1); the animals presented higher live weight (511 vs 494 kg), higher warm carcass weight (285 vs 272 kg) and an increase in fat thickness (4.97 vs 4.25 mm) compared to control animals. These increases in performance gave higher economic results, with a profit margin of R$ 122.84 per animal. A waiting period of 16 h before slaughter resulted in monensin concentrations below 0.25 µg kg?1 in edible organs and tissues, values well below those permitted by legislation. The use of monensin for young bulls in confinement promoted improvements in productive and economic performance, without leaving residues in edible tissues.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28474/23205,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of slow release urea in sheep feed on nitrogen balance,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% slow release urea (SRU) in sheep feed on nitrogen balance (intake, fecal and urinary excretion, nitrogen absorbed and retained and/or nitrogen balance). Four sheep with an average body weight (BW) of 30.8 ± 1.7 kg were distributed using a Latin square experimental design. Sheep were allocated in metabolic cages and received two meals a day. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and differences were tested using a regression equation with a 5% probability. The inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% SRU in sheep diets did not change (p > 0.05) nitrogen intake (NI), with an average value of 20.49 g animal day-1 and 1.57 g (kg0.75)-1. The inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% SRU in sheep diets did not affect (p > 0.05) fecal nitrogen (FN) in g (kg0.75)-1, with an average value of 0.65 g (kg0.75)-1. However, the inclusion of SRU changed (p < 0.05) the FN, expressed as g animal day-1, and % BW, in a quadratic manner. The lowest FN excretion was 7.63 g animal day-1 and 36.41% NI, and it was obtained at inclusion levels of 0.82% and 0.66% SRU, respectively. The inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% SRU in sheep diets had a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) in urinary nitrogen (UN), expressed as g animal day-1, g (kg0.75)-1, and % of NI. The minimum values calculated with the equations for UN were 0.86 g animal day-1, 0.06 g (kg0.75)-1, and 0.28% NI for SRU inclusion levels of 0.79%, 0.76%, and 0.71%, respectively. The inclusion of 0.0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.2% SRU in sheep diets did not change (p > 0.05) the NB expressed as g animal day-1 (10.86) and g (kg0.75)-1 (0.82). However, the NB expressed as % NI or in relation to the NI responded in a quadratic manner (p < 0.05) to the inclusion of different levels of SRU in sheep food. The maximum value for NB was 59.68% NI and it was obtained at 0.68% SRU. Thus, the inclusion of 0.6% to 0.8% slow release urea in sheep diets provides the lowest fecal and urinary nitrogen losses. In addition, these levels provide the best NB values, expressed as a percentage of NI.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27295/23307,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Characteristics of the carcass and quality of meat of male and female calves with different high-grain diets in confinement,"The goal of the present study was to evaluatecharacteristics of the carcass and meat of steers and heifers, finished in feedlots and fed different high-grain diets. Forty-five bovines were used: 21 heifers, with an initial age of 32 months and initial weight of 359.9 kg, and 24 steers, with an initial age of 20 months and initial weight of 337.6 kg, from a Charolais × Nelore crossbreed. The animals were divided among the treatments, which were defined by the energy source used in the diet: rice, white oats, or corn; seven heifers and eight steers were used per diet treatment. The animals remained confined until reaching an estimated warm carcass weight of 220 kg. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement. Weights at slaughter were higher for animals fed white oats (449.3 kg) or corn (430.4 kg) than for animals fed rice (401.8 kg). Higher carcass yields were found in corn-fed animals. Animals that received rice had lower coverfat thickness. The yields of the rib and hind-quarter commercial cuts were higher for cattle that received white oats or corn. Animals that received corn diets had greater arm circumference than animals that received white oatsand both were larger than animals that were fed rice. The tenderness (5.15 points) and palatability (5.46 points) of rice-fed animals werelower than those of animals fed white oats (5.73 and 6.40 points, respectively) or corn (6.04 and 6.45 points, respectively). Slaughter weights were similar between categories - 424.1 kg and 430.2 kg for steers and heifers, respectively. Steers had higher fore-quarter yield (38.0% vs.37.4%), whereas heifers had a greater carcass length (126.0 cm vs. 123.1 cm). The finishing of cattle with corn- or white oat-based high grain-diets yielded heavier carcasses, with adequate deposition of fat, andbetter performance of principal carcass cuts. Feeding with rice in high-grain diets produced leaner meats, but reduced carcass weight, with greater losses upon cooling and less tender meat. The production of confined heifers or steers ensures similar meat products.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26004/23203,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Sodium bicarbonate and HEPES as buffer components for cooling the semen of pony stallions,"The composition of semen diluents can modify its viability during cooling. The buffering effects of HEPES and sodium bicarbonate were evaluated considering the pH and sperm viability. The semen of seven adult Brazilian ponies was evaluated before and after cooling at 5oC for 24 h and 48 h. A non-buffered skim milk powder extender (C) and the same extender buffered with sodium bicarbonate (SB) and HEPES (H) were used. After dilution, semen (three ejaculates/pony) was centrifuged and the seminal plasma discarded. Sperm was then diluted with SB, H or C and its concentration adjusted to 50 x 106 sptz/mL. Progressive motility evaluated after dilution showed similar results with all extenders (71.42% (SB), 74.28% (H), and 74.52% (C)). Sperm motility was evaluated 24 h and 48 h after cooling for SB (44.76% and 25.23%), H (51.42% and 38.09%) and C (54.05% and 41.66%, respectively). Plasma membrane integrity was similar after exposure to the three extenders (62.71% (SB), 68.76% (H), and 69.23% (C)). Mitochondrial activity was higher in SB immediately after dilution (SB= 1.05nm, H= 0.81nm, C= 0.79nm), and after 24 h (0.83nm (SB), 0.73nm (H) and 0.64nm (C)). After 48 h, the mitochondrial activity decreased to 0.72nm (SB), 0.69nm (H), and 0.63nm (C) (P > 0.05). The pH, osmolarity and pH after 48 h of cooling of the diluted semen were higher in SB (8; 382; 7.9), intermediate in H (7.5; 362; 7.32) and lower in C (7.16; 350; 7.07). Lipid peroxidation and its induction were similar in all groups. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Duncan’s test was used to evaluate the significant differences (P < 0.05). Sodium bicarbonate reduced the progressive motility and increased the semen pH. The extender C was considered more appropriate for immediate use in artificial insemination. The non-buffered and HEPES-buffered extenders were considered appropriate for the cooling of equine semen for 48 h at 5°C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30013/23196,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effectiveness of Cratylia argentea as an animal feed supplement in the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep,"Gastrointestinal nematodes are considered one of the most important sanitary problems affecting ruminants globally; whether parasitizing alone or acting with other pathogens, they are responsible for severe economic losses related to animal husbandry. Endoparasites in small ruminants are usually controlled with anti-helminthic drugs. However, certain strains of endoparasites are resistant to such drugs. Supplementation of the diet with protein-rich foods is one strategy for reducing the negative impact of gastrointestinal parasites. Cratylia argentea has anthelmintic properties and other characteristics that favor its use as an animal feed supplement. In the present study, we subdivided crossbred lambs into homogeneous groups and fed them C. argentea (G1), C. argentea plus Brachiaria spp. (G2), or Brachiaria spp. (G3) only. The animals in group G1 had a lower average number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) at Day 42 (p < 0.05), and the average count was ten times lower than that in the control at the last evaluated time-point (Day 56). The animals exhibited linear weight gain, and those in group G1 gained the most weight. The combined use of drugs and plants containing bioactive compounds can minimize the evolution of multidrug resistance, prolonging the efficacy of the drugs. The FAMACHA® score showed little variation during the experiment (p > 0.05), indicating the absence of anemia and normal globular volume. This reinforces the importance of the measurement of EPG; this is a quantitative method and does not depend on the subjective interpretation of the results.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31047/23198,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effects of protein supplementation on resistance and resilience of lambs naturally infected with gastrointestinal parasites,"In this study, the objective was to evaluate the efficacy of protein supplementation on gastrointestinal nematode control in lambs naturally infected. Sixty weaned Ile de France and Texel crossbred lambs, with 60 days of age, were divided into three groups (n=20) according to the level of protein in the concentrate: low protein (LP; 8.5%), moderate protein (MP; 15%), and high protein (HP; 25%). The daily amount of concentrate offered was based on 3% of live weight, which was continued throughout the experiment of 98 days. Evaluations were conducted biweekly from days 0 (D0) to 98 (D98). There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the average weight among the LP, MP and HP groups, which was 22.0, 21.4, and 21.1 kg, respectively, on D0 and 46.4, 48.3, and 48.2 kg, respectively, on D98. The daily weight gain was not significantly different among the groups (LP, 250 g; MP and HP, 276 g; p > 0.05). The average egg count per gram of feces (epg) of the LP group on D98 (6,765; an increase of 5,690 epg from D0) was higher than that of the MP and HP groups (1,617.5, p < 0.05 and 3,435, p > 0.05, respectively), which remained constant throughout the study. The hematocrit values decreased (p < 0.05) from D0 to D98 only in the LP group. Only in the HP group (p < 0.05), the mean serum total protein concentration increased from D0 (5.3 g dL-1) to D98 (5.8 g dL-1). The average albumin level on D98 (2.10 g dL-1) was lower than that on D0 (2.52 g dL-1) in the LP group (p < 0.05). During the study, 10 lambs overall were treated with anthelmintic because the epg values exceeded 10,000; six treated lambs were from the LP group, 3 from the HP group, and only 1 from the MP group. These results indicate that supplementation of diet with 15% protein increases the resistance and resilience of lambs to gastrointestinal parasites.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30533/23197,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,The role of Kisspeptin in bovine in vitro embryo production,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Kisspeptin (Kp) on the medium used in different stages of in vitro production of bovine embryo (IVEP), evaluating cleavage (CR) and blastocyst (BR) rates. The study was divided into three experiments that analyzed, respectively, the action of Kp on in vitro maturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF), and in vitro culture (IVC) of bovine embryos. In experiment 1, the oocytes were matured in IVM medium and distributed into the following treatments: maturation (IVM Control, n = 102), maturation with addition of 10-7 M Kp (Kp 10-7 IVM, n = 90), and hormone-free maturation luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with the addition of 10-7M Kp (No hormones + Kp 10-7, n = 84), following maturation to normal stages of IVEP. In experiment 2, the oocytes were fertilized in IVF medium, in the following treatments: TALP-FERT without Kp (Control IVF, n = 103) and TALP-FERT with the addition of 10-7M Kp (Kp 10-7 IVF, n = 119), usually following the other steps. Finally, in the third experiment, the oocytes passed through all phases and were divided into IVC in two treatments: SOF medium without Kp (Control IVC, n = 109) and SOF medium with the addition of 10-7M Kp (Kp 10-7, N = 106). The data were analyzed by PROC GLIMMIX of the SAS program. In experiment 1, the means of CR and BR were similar (P > 0.05) between treatments (IVM Control76.47% and 37.25%, Kp 10-7 MIV80% and 33.33%, and No hormones + Kp 10-770.24% and 30.95%, respectively). In experiment 2, the means of CR were similar for the IVF Control and Kp 10-7 IVF groups (P > 0.05), 76.70% and 86.55% respectively. But, the mean of the BR of the group Kp 10-7 IVF was 38.66%, which was higher (P < 0.05) than that of the FIV Control group, which was 31.07%. In the third experiment, the means of CR and BR (P > 0.05) were similar between the IVC Control and Kp 10-7 IVC groups (CR 83.50% and 78.30%, and BR 26.60% and 23.60%, respectively). Although at this concentration of 10-7M during IVC no change in embryo production is seen, Kp presents the same performance as both gonadotrophins in oocyte maturation and modulates the fertilization process, providing more blastocysts. With these findings, it can be seen that Kp presents a regulatory action on bovine reproduction, and can be an excellent tool to maximize IVEP indexes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29877/23301,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Evaluation of equine corneal endothelium after exposure to 0.5% indocyanine green - in vitro study,"The purpose of the study was to investigate whether indocyanine green (ICG) dye damages the corneal endothelium of horses. Twenty-four corneas of 12 healthy equines, males or females, of different ages were used in this study. Only eyes with no ocular findings were used. Randomly, one eye was included in the treatment group and one in the control group. The eyes of the treatment group were exposed for 1 minute to dye ICG 0.5%. After that the endothelium of all eyes was stained with trypan blue and alizarin red S and analyzed and photographed under an optical microscope. Areas with damaged endothelial cells were manually measured and quantified using software for morphometric analysis and expressed as a percentage of cell damage. In all eyes examined areas of cell damage were observed in both corneas of the control group and the treatment group. The mean endothelial damage was 0.8 ± 0.37% in the treatment group and 0.97 ± 0.39% in the control. The Qui-square test stated that treatment and control group were not different. The ICG 0.5% did not cause acute damage to equine corneal endothelium.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29593/23300,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Short-term evaluation of an intra-articular technique for cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs using nylon or polyester,"Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCrLR) is a common condition found in the small animal routine, being correlated to traumas, obesity, genetic factors, and primary osteoarthritis (OA) in dogs. Affected animals show articular instability that, if not corrected surgically, may cause secondary OA and loss of limb function. The aim of this study was to compare short-term results of the intra-articular technique for knee stabilization after CCrLR using a surgical button associated with polyester yarn (Group A), the surgical button associated with nylon yarn (Group B), and surgical toggle associated with polyester yarn (Group C). Eighteen dogs presenting CCrLR, weight varying from 5 to 35 kg, and different sex and breed were divided into three groups of six individuals. OA radiographic grade, pre- and post-operative lameness, surgical time, and the macroscopic aspect of cartilage were assessed. The intra-articular technique was performed by passing a suture through two tunnels, drilled in the femoral condyle and tibial crest to stabilize the knee joint. Twelve animals presented a decreased lameness and normal limb function after 15 days. On the other hand, four dogs from Group B presented complications: two dogs had suture rupture after 30 days and other two showed muscular contracture with decreased range of motion, followed by loss of limb function. In Group A, one dog showed suture rupture after 15 days and other had suture infection after 30 days. In Group C, dogs recovered normal limb function without complications. Therefore, surgical toggle associated with polyester yarn was better than the other studied materials.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28565/23192,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Molecular detection of Rickettsia spp. in ticks collected from dogs from the Department of Piura, Peru","The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of ticks positive for genus Rickettsia bacteria among ticks collected from domestic dogs in the Department of Piura, Peru, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Ticks were collected from dogs in urban areas of the metropolitan region of Piura, Peru. Only three species of ticks were identified; 977 Rhipicephalus sanguineus (180 nymphs, 417 females, and 380 males), Six Amblyomma triste females, and one Amblyomma tigrinum male. After classifying the specimens morphologically by stage, species, and sex, their total DNA was tested by PCR using primers that amplify fragments of the gltA, ompA, ompB, and htrA genes. The resulting positive sample was sequenced, compared to the GenBank database, and analyzed phylogenetically. The Rickettsia spp. infection rate in the tick pools was 0.2% (1/484); the positive specimen was an R. sanguineus tick. GenBank analysis of the positive sequence revealed 100% identify with Rickettsia felis; however, no products of the htrA, ompA and ompB genes were amplified from this sample. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of R. felis in R. sanguineus in Peru.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29052/23193,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Clinical responses to acute blood loss in goats,"The response to blood loss is directly related to the degree of hemorrhage, but for the caprine species some aspects still need to be investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the clinical and hemodynamic effects of acute blood loss in goats. Eight healthy, adult male crossbred goats were subjected to external jugular puncture to remove 30% of the total blood volume. A physical examination and blood gas, biochemical, and hematologic analyses were performed at baseline, before blood loss (T0), and after one (T1h), six (T6h), 12 (T12h), 24 (T24h) and 72 (T72h) hours, and eight (T8d), 16 (T16d), 24 (T24d) and 32 (T32d) days after the acute blood loss event. The goats presented with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia one hour after blood loss with a return to normal physiological values at T6h. Packed cell volume was decreased at T1h and red cell counts at T12h, both returning to baseline at T24d. There was a reduction in total protein and albumin levels at T1h, both remained below baseline levels until T16d and T8d, respectively. The serum calcium concentration decreased over the period T1h to T24h and glucose increased over the period T1h to T6h. The values of pH, TCO2, bicarbonate, and base excess were lower at T1h, while lactate increased markedly at this time. The pCO2 value only was reduced at T24h. Systolic (PS), diastolic (PD), and mean (PM) pressures were decreased at T1h. Acute loss of 30% of blood volume in goats caused changes in clinical, blood gas, and biochemical parameters, which were restored over a six-hour period, while hematologic changes were more persistent, with baseline values restored only after 24 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27609/23191,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Canines vaccinated against visceral leishmaniasis develop a serological response to the Leishmania braziliensis antigen,"American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a zoonosis caused by Leishmania, a protozoan. Common antigens occur in the strains found in America, which allow antigenic cross-reactivity. Therefore, multivalent vaccines can be used for this pathogen. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of two different commercial vaccines for visceral leishmaniasis to induce an immune response to the soluble L. (Viannia) braziliensis antigens. In 2014, 70 seronegative dogs from the municipality of Iúna (Espírito Santo State, Brazil) were vaccinated and serologically evaluated by ELISA and immunoblotting by using the soluble antigen of L. braziliensis. Of the 121 dogs initially selected, only 70 received vaccination because 51 dogs tested positive by ELISA, yielding a positive frequency of 42.14% in the asymptomatic group. These 70 dogs were divided into two equal groups and administered three doses of each vaccine, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. We found that the sera of dogs immunized with three doses of both vaccines A and B had antibodies against the soluble antigens of L. (V.) braziliensis, as determined by ELISA and immunoblotting 120 days post vaccination. Antibodies produced in response to vaccines A and B were found in 22/35 and 18/35 serum samples, respectively, at T1 (120 days), while 7/35 and 4/35 serum samples tested positive at T2 (240 days). Furthermore, immunoblotting allowed us to differentiate between vaccinated and asymptomatic dogs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26350/23190,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Use of Chlorella sp. for coating ‘tommy atkins’ mango fruits stored under refrigeration,"The number of studies on edible coatings that are used for extending the shelf life of fruits has steadily increased. For this purpose, it is necessary to choose raw materials with characteristics that maintain product quality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of coatings of Chlorella sp. on the post-harvest conservation of ‘Tommy Atkins’ mango fruits. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design, and spray treatments (T) with 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, or 4% of Chlorella sp. were applied to the fruits. After the treatments, the fruits were stored for 28 days (21 days at 10 °C and 42% relative humidity and 7 days at 25 °C and 42% relative humidity), and were analyzed on day 28. There was higher pulp firmness in fruits as the concentration of Chlorella sp. was increased, and the concentration of ascorbic acid was comparatively higher (22.17%) in fruits treated with 3% Chlorella sp. The percentage of soluble solids and the soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio were decreased as the coating concentrations were decreased. The use of Chlorella sp. at 1% and 2% allowed fruit maturation without compromising fruit quality attributes during the 28-day storage period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28851/23189,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Selectivity of chlorantraniliprole and lambda-cyhalothrin to the egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae),"Soybean plants host a diverse complex of pest insects, which can occur simultaneously during crop development. Thus, the use of egg parasitoids for the management of Euschistus heros (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) depends on the selectivity of the pesticides to the stink bug. Thus, the selectivity of the active ingredients chlorantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin to the parasitoid Telenomus podisi (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) was evaluated. The bioassays were carried out under controlled conditions (27 ± 2 ºC and 50 ± 10% relative humidity) for the pupal and adult phases of the parasitoid. The design was completely randomized, with 10 treatments and five replicates composed of the insecticides chlorantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin in different doses, as well as a negative control using water and a positive control using chlorpyrifos. We used a Potter Tower for the applications, and evaluations were carried out 24, 72, and 120 hours after the applications. Experimental methods and analyses to determine the harmfulness of the products to the insects were in accordance with International Organization for Biological Control standards. Chlorantraniliprole, at all doses tested, was less harmful to the parasitoid, especially in the adult phase; the doses were classified as class 1. The chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin mixture at its highest dose was classified as class 4, at 72 and 120 hours after application. For the pupal phase of the parasitoid, there were no significant differences, and the products were classified as class 1, except for the highest dose of chlorantraniliprole, which classified as class 2, at 24 hours after application. Thus, chlorantraniliprole can be considered a tool in the management of soybean pests. Its selectivity to T. podisi under the conditions tested presents low or no negative interference when sprayed on pupae and adults. However, the chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin mixture should be used with caution, respecting the time of application and the recommended doses, as it interferes negatively in the development of the parasitoid and should be replaced when possible.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30464/23188,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Sample size to estimate the mean of morphological traits of rye cultivars in sowing dates and evaluation times,"The objectives of this study were to determine the sample size (number of plants) required to estimate the mean of morphological traits of rye (Secale cereale L.) and verify the sample size variability between the traits, cultivars, sowing dates, and evaluation times for distincts mean estimation errors. Ten uniformity trials were performed with two rye cultivars (BRS Progresso and Temprano) in five sowing dates (05/03/2016, 05/25/2016, 06/07/2016, 06/22/2016 and 07/04/2016). Evaluations of traits plant height, number of leaves, and number of stems were performed during the development of the crop. In order to verify the difference of the traits between cultivars and between sowing dates and evaluation times, the F-test was applied to test the hypothesis of homogeneity of variances and the Student’s t-test was used to test the hypothesis of equality of means. The sample size of each trait was calculated for distincts mean estimation errors. There is sample size variability between the traits, cultivars, sowing dates, and evaluation times. In order to estimate the mean of plant height with the same precision, smaller sample sizes are required at the intermediate and final evaluation times compared to initial evaluation times. For the traits number of leaves and stems, smaller sample sizes are required in the initial evaluation times than in the final evaluation times. For mean estimation of traits with maximum estimation error of 15% between sowing dates and evaluation times, 83 and 103 plants are required respectively for cultivars BRS Progresso and Temprano.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29999/23200,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Compartments of organic matter in an Oxisol under different types of no-tillage systems,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in soil carbon (C) as well as its fractions of physical (particulate organic carbon associated with minerals), chemical (fulvic and humic acids and humins), and oxidizable (F1, F2, F3, and F4) forms of an Oxisol under no-tillage systems (SPD) under different successions and crop rotations in the Cerrado area. In order to do this, the areas of consolidated SPD (10 to 20 years) under the same soil and climatic conditions were selected in Montividiu (GO), with soybean-corn succession (SSM), soybean-millet succession (SSMt), soybean-millet-bean-cotton rotation (RSMFA), crop-livestock integration (ILP), and a native cerrado (CE) area used as a control treatment In each area, samples were collected at depths of 0.0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m, respectively. The no-tillage system with crop rotation, followed by no-tillage system with crop-livestock integration, were the ones that presented the greatest potential to increase total carbon content in soil, presenting higher C contents of the granulometric, humic, and oxidizable fractions of the soil organic matter (SOM), compared with the other areas of no-tillage systems with succession of the respective evaluated crops. The no-tillage areas with corn and soybean/millet succession systems showed a similar pattern in soil C accumulation, as well as in the compartments of SOM evaluated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30308/23201,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Gas exchange, leaf and root dry mass in Bell Pepper under fertigation with nitrogen and potassium","Bell pepper is a vegetable-fruit of great economic importance in Brazil. Crop production demands adequate water supply, nutrients, and light. The objective of this study was to evaluate gas exchange (net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, internal carbon concentration and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency) and dry mass accumulation in leaves and roots under fertigation with nitrogen and potassium. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design in a factorial scheme (4 × 4) with four replications and a total of 64 experimental units. Treatments consisted of a combination of four nitrogen doses (0; 73.4; 146.8 and 293.6 kg ha-1 of N) with four doses of potassium (0; 53.3; 106.7 and 213.4 kg ha-1 of K). An infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) coupled with a light source (irradiation of 600 µmol m-2 s-1) was used for the evaluation of gas exchange. There was a significant interactive effect of N and K on net photosynthesis and leaf and root dry mass. Root dry mass was the variable that best expressed this interaction. Physiological variables measured were more responsive to nitrogen fertilization than to K fertilization. The optimum values of stomatal conductance, transpiration, internal carbon concentration and carboxylation efficiency were obtained with the application of nitrogen doses between 147 and 294 kg ha-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29683/23186,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Development and evaluation of operational performance of macaw fruits semi-mechanized harvester by means mechanical vibrations principle,"Macaw (Acrocomia aculeata) is a product of Brazilian socio-biodiversity and is an excellent source of oil for the cosmetics, food and fuel industry. One of the technical bottlenecks of macaw fruit production is the manual harvesting with rudimentary tools and the extractive system, which has a very large dependence on labor. The objective of this work was to develop the informational and conceptual design of a semi-mechanized harvesting system that can be used in adverse conditions of relief, also directed to the needs of family farmers. In this work the concept of a low cost macaw harvester is proposed, which works by the principle of mechanical vibrations, and is able to work efficiently in planted and natural plantations. From an adaptation of the Pahl and Beitz method for the development of machine designs, and the use of the evolution prototyping method, integration prototypes were constructed, which underwent a preliminary field test. Some modifications were made in portable coffee breakers, which constituted changes in the vibration signal generation system that were transmitted to macaw fruits at the head / plant interface. Only one of the built prototypes was considered effective and suitable for subsequent performance (product under patent registration). For the detailed design, CAD (Computer Aided Design) techniques were employed. Later, it was possible to observe the validation of efficiency of the macaw fruit harvest by the principle of mechanical vibrations. Under field conditions, field trials demonstrated that the average harvest efficiency for the proposed model with vibrating rods was 97.4% and the average harvesting capacity was 566.91 kg h-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29259/23185,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Positive effect of organic zinc supplementation on the persistence of anti-rabies neutralizing antibodies in healthy sheep,"The main prophylactic tool to control rabies in herbivores is the systematic vaccination of susceptible animals. This study aimed to evaluate the positive effect of organic zinc (Zn) supplementation on the persistence of anti-rabies neutralizing antibodies in healthy sheep. A total of 36 Texel ewes were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups of 18 animals each. The treated group (TG) received organic Zn supplementation for 90 days, and after this period, 2 doses of rabies vaccine with a 30-day interval. The control group (CG) received the vaccine doses only and was not supplemented with organic Zn. Blood samples were collected before the first vaccination and 30, 60, and 90 days after vaccination, to determine the anti-rabies neutralizing antibody titer using the Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT). The average values of anti-rabies serum-neutralizing antibodies 30 days after the first dose were 1.33 ± 0.62 IU mL-1 for the CG and 1.57 ± 0.80 IU mL-1 for the TG; 60 days after the second dose the average values were 7.60 ± 7.08 IU mL-1 and 12.97 ± 9.46 IU mL-1 for the CG and TG, respectively, with a significant difference between groups. The TG presented 100% vaccine coverage of the primary vaccination, whereas the CG presented 89.47% coverage. Oral supplementation with 75 mg organic Zn significantly increased the persistence of anti-rabies antibody titers in sheep, and it improved the vaccine coverage of the primary vaccination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28639/23298,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Persistence of the red ring nematode in the roots and in the rhizosphere of recently eradicated coconut palms,"Red ring disease is one of the primary diseases that attacks the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.) in Brazil. This lethal disease is caused by a nematode (Bursaphelenchus cocophilus) and can spread via contaminated tools or by the South American palm weevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum). The goal of this research was to determine the persistence of nematodes within the roots and the rhizosphere of recently eradicated coconut palms, cultivated in the coastal region of the state of Alagoas. Soil and root samples from coconut palms with advanced symptoms of red ring disease were collected up to 6 months after the eradication of the plants. Sample processing was conducted at the Ecology and Insect Behavior Laboratory of the Federal University of Alagoas. Sample collection was ended when B. cocophilus were no longer found in the laboratory tests. B. cocophilus were able to survive in the coconut palm roots for at least 118 and 133 days after felling (DAF), in Coruripe and São Miguel dos Milagres, respectively. B. cocophilus could migrated from the roots to the soil, where they were found until 76 and 88 DAF, in Coruripe and São Miguel dos Milagres, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28790/23299,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Replacement of liming and NPK fertilization with turkey litter in degraded areas grown with Urochloa decumbens,"Soil fertility and acidity correction in recovering areas require high doses of correctives and fertilizers. Therefore, the use of low-cost products may be an alternative in infertile areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil fertilization and correction methods on the yield of degraded areas cultivated with Urochloa decumbens and soil chemical attributes. The study was conducted in Orthic Quartzarenic Neosol in Mineiros, Goiás, Brazil, from October 2011 to September 2013. The experiment included soil samples treated with 2 Mg ha-1 of dolomitic limestone, a standard fertilizer (45, 54, and 75 kg ha-1 of N, P, and K, respectively), or 3 Mg ha-1 of turkey litter, and a control sample without correction/fertilization. Each treatment included four replicates in a completely randomized block design. The experimental plots consisted of areas of 4.0 m2 (2.0 ?? 2.0 m). The dry matter yield of forage grass and the following soil chemical attributes were evaluated: organic matter, hydrogen potential (pH in CaCl2), phosphorus (resin), potassium, calcium, magnesium, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and base saturation. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, and the means were compared using Tukey’s test at a level of significance of 0.05. Fertilization did not affect the pH, potassium, and CEC of the soil. Fertilization with turkey litter increased the levels of organic matter, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and base saturation compared with soils subjected to standard fertilization or liming. Furthermore, soils fertilized with turkey litter presented higher dry matter yield of Urochloa decumbens compared with unfertilized soils or soils subjected to acidity correction by liming but were not significantly different from soils treated with standard fertilizers. Therefore, fertilization with 3 Mg ha-1 of turkey litter is recommended for improving degraded pastures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28539/23348,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Growth of escarole in different seasons of year, RS, Brazil","The lack of research about escarole cultivars adapted to each region, as well as technical information on plant growth have been some of the factors related to low yields. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth of escarole crop in four seasons of year in Santa Maria, RS. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design, 1 x 4, being a escarole (cultivar Escorola Lisa®) evaluated in four seasons of year (summer, autumn, winter and spring), in six replications. The evaluations were performed in a destructive manner every seven days, from date of transplant to harvest point. The following components were analyzed: number of leaves, number of residues, dry mass of leaves, dry mass of leaves, stem and residue. Thus, it was determined the parameters for growth analysis. With the data obtained, we performed a variance analysis, and presented significant results, and the means of each season of the year submitted to the Tukey test at 5% of error probability. The air temperature and global radiation influence crop cycle. Lower temperatures and lower incidence of radiation result in cycle extended, as observed in autumn. The escarole growth is influenced by seasons of year in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), and summer and spring finish the cycle in advance to others, presenting a larger leaf area. Summer and spring are most indicated season to escarole crop in RS, Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28513/23181,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Use of natural antioxidants in in vitro mammalian embryo production,"In vitro embryo production (IVEP) contributes to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of animal reproduction. Nevertheless, inherent technical factors such as oxidative stress can negatively influence the result and this can impair cell metabolism, thus decreasing the rates of in vitro development, and necessitating the supplementation of culture medium with antioxidants. In this context, compounds of natural origin with this property have been highlighted because of the positive results obtained at different stages of IVEP. Thus, this review aims to present the results obtained by using natural antioxidants to minimize the effects of oxidative stress on gametes and embryos. A variety of natural isolated substances and mixtures (essential oils and extracts) have been studied for supplementation of IVEP media, at stages of in vitro maturation, sperm capacitation, in vitro fertilization, and in vitro development of embryos in different mammalian species. Generally, beneficial effects are observed according to the concentration used, thus demonstrating the potential of several natural antioxidants. Therefore, the main challenges in using these compounds as antioxidants during IVEP include proving their efficiency against free radicals and determining the best concentration at each stage. In addition, understanding the mechanisms of action of such antioxidants is crucial to establishing their use in IVEP biotechnology.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30471/23077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Prevalence study on Trypanosoma vivax in dairy cattle in the Western region on the State of Paraná, Brazil","In Brazil, Trypanosoma vivax is present in several states. The disease is endemic in Pantanal and Minas Gerais. In Paraná there is still no report of the parasite, but due to the state borders with Mato Grosso do Sul, São Paulo, Paraguay and Argentina, it is believed that the protozoan circulates in the region without diagnosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of T. vivax in dairy cattle in the western region of Paraná. For this purpose, 600 blood samples and 400 serum samples were collected from dairy cattle, distributed in 60 and 40 properties, respectively. While buffy coat smears were performed on blood samples, serum samples were used in Indirect Immunofluorescence Reaction. All samples, in both techniques, presented negative results for T. vivax. These results indicate that the studied hemoprotozoan is not circulating among the cattle in the western region of Paraná. However, future work evolving beef cattle must be carried out and preventive measures should be adopted in order to avoid the entry of the parasite in the State of Paraná.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29899/23103,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Proteolytic behavior of isolated Pseudomonas spp. from refrigerated raw milk in different concentrations and storage temperatures,"The objective of the work was to evaluate the multiplication capacity and proteolytic activity of different Pseudomonas spp. cell counts inoculated in milk and storaged under different temperature. Strains isolated from refrigerated raw milk (RRM) were confirmed at genus level by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The Pseudomonas spp. was cultured in cephalothin-sodium fusidate-cetrimide (CFC) agar-base (30?C for 48 h) until it reached 2 log and 6 log CFU mL-1. Three of eight strains confirmed as Pseudomonas spp were inoculated in sterile reconstituted whole milk powder and incubated at 2°C, 4°C, and 8°C for 96 h. Primary proteolysis indices was determined by the Kjeldahl method. When taking into account the effect of storage time in Pseudomonas spp. population, it was found that the initial population (2 log CFU mL-1) showed significant difference in growth rates only from 0 h to 24 h, keeping at the same levels along 96 h. When a higher initial population was incubated (6 log CFU mL-1), it was not observed a significant difference for times tested. Related to the effect of storage time in proteolysis index, it was not observed a significant difference in samples inoculated with 2 and 6 log CFU mL-1 Pseudomonas spp. When we analyzed the influence of storage temperature on the bacterial multiplication, there was a significant difference in the Pseudomonas spp. population only between 2°C and 8°C after 96 h of milk storage with 2 log CFU/mL of initial inoculum. If we consider the temperature effect in the primary proteolysis index, there were significant differences at the inoculum of 2 log CFU mL-1 where the primary proteolysis at 24 h was lower at 2°C than at 8ºC. Low temperatures or short storage time had no influence on Pseudomonas spp. enumeration or in the primary proteolysis index when high initial contaminations are observed. At lower Pseudomonas spp. initial population, the smaller storage time tested influenced the population control, and linked with the reduction in the storage temperature, lower proteolysis index were observed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29828/23075,E-ISSN 1679-0359

39,2018,Diets for sheeps whit levels of residual frying oil consequences on ingestive behavior,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the ingestive behavior of lambs fed diets containing different levels of residual frying oil. Different residual frying oil concentrations (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 g kg-1 dry matter base) in the diets of lambs were evaluated. The experimental diets were formulated to contain 12.8% crude protein (CP) with a 60:40 roughage:concentrate ratio. In each observation period, the following variables were measured: time spent eating, time spent ruminating, time spent idle, and number and time of ruminating chews per ruminated bolus. Animals were randomly allocated to treatment groups according to a Latin square design, with five treatments and five experimental periods. The average values were analyzed using regression analysis to 5%. There was no difference for the time spent feeding, ruminating and being idle. No differences in daily feeding number, total chewing time, number of rumination boluses, number of rumination chews per bolus, rumination chew time per bolus and feeding efficiency were observed. The efficiency of rumination for dry matter and neutral detergent fiber showed a decreased linear effect. It can be concluded that the inclusion of residual frying oil does not affect activities of feeding, rumination and being idle as well as the parameters of rumination chewing, but it does decrease the efficiency of rumination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30870/23071,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity measured by two techniques and at different sampling positions relative to maize-crop rows and interrows,"Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) reflects porous system ability to transfer water in the soil-plant system. The study aimed to measure Ks through two distinct techniques. One of them was carried out in the laboratory by applying the constant-head cylinder method (CHC) in undisturbed samples, herein referred to as a standard technique. The other consisted of a simplified falling-head technique to measure Ks in situ (SFH), as proposed by Bagarello et al. (2004). We also verified the correlations of the obtained Ks values with other soil physical properties. SFH method is simpler, faster and does not require sophisticated equipment, which can be executed directly in the field. The experiment was conducted in the city of Floresta (PR), Brazil, at Cocamar Technology Diffusion Unit. It consisted of four treatments: maize-crop interrow without recent machine traffic (MI), maize-crop interrow traveled by a harvester (MIT), maize-crop row (MR) and its relative position to brachiaria crop row sown in consortium, and in maize-crop interrow (BR). In each treatment, 10 sampling points were defined (repetitions), where Ks was determined by SFH and an undisturbed sample was taken to measure Ks in the laboratory. Ks values measured by methodological approaches were compared through the following statistical indices, with their respective results: Willmott's concordance index (0.944), maximum error (1.269) and mean absolute error (0.291), square root of normalized mean error (0.45), determination coefficient (0.88), residual mass coefficient (0.07), efficiency coefficient (0.72), performance index (0.80), and Pearson's correlation (0.85). A high agreement was found between the studied techniques, with measured values close to each other. Notably, we must give emphasis on SFH since it had a variation coefficient 1.4 times lower than the standard technique.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29788/23073,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of row spacing and plant density on grain yield and yield components of Crambe abyssinica Hochst,"Understanding the influence of row spacing and plant density on grain yield and yield components of crambe is critical in order to obtain higher grain yields. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of row spacing and plant density on grain yield and its components in crambe in two distinct regions of Brazil (Marechal Candido Rondon-PR, MCR-PR, and Botucatu-SP, BTU-SP). Narrow and wide row spacing (0.20 and 0.40 m) combined with four plant densities (15, 25, 35, and 45 plants m-1) were evaluated in a randomized block layout with four replications in a 2 × 4 factorial design. The experiment at BTU-SP was run under rainfed conditions with supplementary irrigation, whereas the experiment at MCR-PR was run under rainfed conditions without supplementary irrigation. Both experiments were run in soils classified as Oxisols. There was no interaction between row spacing and plant density. Highest grain yield with supplementary irrigation was observed at 0.20 m row spacing. Without irrigation, row spacing did not affect grain yield owing to the plasticity of crop. The highest grain yield was observed with approximately 30 plants m-1 at both experimental locations. A strong negative correlation was observed between final plant population and number of grains per plant. There was high plant mortality, particularly at high plant densities cultivated under irrigation. Higher mortality occurred because of high intraspecific competition and a larger disease incidence due to the higher humidity in the irrigated experiment. A mechanism of self-adjustment by plant density was observed in crambe, with its intensity dependent on plant density and environmental conditions, such as water and nutrient availability and light incidence.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25493/23072,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Carcass characteristics and meat quality of finishing gilts fed diets with different levels of SID methionine + cystine and vitamin B6 supplementation,"This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of different levels of standardized ileal digestible (SID) methionine + cystine (Met + Cys) and vitamin B6 supplementation on the carcass characteristics and longissimus lumborum (LL) quality in gilts from 75 to 100 kg. Fifty-six gilts were used (Talent x Topigs 20), with an initial average body weight of 75.06 ± 1.68 kg, allotted in a completely randomized block design arranged in a 2×4 factorial scheme, composed of two vitamin B6 supplementation levels (1.58 and 3.58 mg/kg) and four levels of SID Met + Cys (0.370, 0.470, 0.570, and 0.670%), with seven replicates and one animal per experimental unit. No interactions (P > 0.05) between vitamin B6 supplementation and SID Met + Cys levels were observed. The levels of SID Met + Cys and vitamin B6 supplementation did not affect the carcass characteristics. Thawing loss increased linearly, and a quadratic effect was observed for cooking loss and shear force of the LL when dietary SID Met + Cys levels increased. The highest cooking loss (27.29%) and shear force (21.58 N) were estimated at 0.528 and 0.539% SID Met + Cys levels, respectively. The dietary SID Met + Cys requirement for gilts (75–100 kg) did not exceed 10.60 g/day (0.37%), based on carcass characteristics and meat quality parameters, and was not affected by vitamin B6 supplementation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30283/23070,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Digestibility and feeding behavior of cattle fed soybean hulls to replace corn in high concentrate diets,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the replacement of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of ground corn (GC) with pelleted soybean hulls (SH) in the concentrate portion of cattle diets. The evaluation was conducted using five 13-month-old Nellore steers cannulated in the rumen, with a mean body weight of 265.00 + 11.60 kg. The steers received a diet composed of 90% concentrate and 10% sugarcane bagasse as the only source of roughage. The statistical design used was a 5x5 Latin square. There was no effect (p > 0.05) of replacement levels or interaction (p > 0.05) between replacement levels and sampling time on ruminal pH, which ranged from 5.8 to 6.0. The apparent digestibility of DM, CP, EE, CHOT and CHONF were not influenced (p > 0.05) by the replacement levels, showing mean values of 67.88 + 2.02; 67.43 + 2.89; 68.29 + 4.11; 70.54 + 1.68 and 80.21 + 1.85%, respectively. The NDF digestibility increased linearly (p < 0.05) with the replacement of corn with soybean hulls. There was no effect (p > 0.05) of replacement levels on time spent feeding (F) and total idle time (TI), with mean values of 10.51 and 4.61% of the day, respectively. However there was a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) of soybean hull inclusion on the time spent ruminating. It was concluded that although the replacement of corn with soybean hull does not improve the ruminal pH of steers fed diets with a high proportion of concentrate, pelleted soybean hulls improve the digestibility of the fibrous fraction of the diet and increase the time spent ruminating, indicating that this ingredient can be included in high-concentrate diets to improve economic efficiency.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29615/23102,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Genotype-environment interaction, genetic trends, and performance dissimilarity of Nellore herds raised in three different environmental gradients","The objectives of this work were to evaluate the genotype-environment interaction, and estimate genetic parameters, genetic trends, and performance dissimilarity-weight gain from birth to weaning (WGBW), adjusted weight to 205 days (W205), weight gain from weaning to 18 months of age (WG18), and adjusted weight to 550 days (W550)-in Nellore animals born between 1986 and 2012, and raised in pasture-based system in three different environmental gradients in Brazil. Data of 62,001 animals-11,729 raised in the Alto Taquari/Bolsão region (ATBR), 21,143 raised in the Campo Grande/Dourados region (CGDR) and 29,129 raised in the western São Paulo/Paraná region (SPPR) in Brazil-were used. The contemporary groups were defined by sex, location, and birth year and season, with at least nine individuals, two different environments, and breeding bulls with at least five progenies. The statistical model contained the direct additive and residual genetic effects (random effects), and environmental and contemporary group effects (fixed effects). Genetic parameters, genotype-environment interaction and genetic trends were estimates using animal model (uni- and/or bi- traits). The level of similarity between regions was evaluated using principal components. The animals raised in the CGDR had superior performance regarding the traits evaluated. The direct heritability estimates ranged from 0.39 to 0.44 (WGBW), 0.41 to 0.45 (W205), 0.42 to 0.55 (WG18) and 0.60 to 0.62 (W550). The maternal heritability of the traits ranged from 0.20 (WGBW), 0.12 to 0.18 (W205), 0.00 to 0.06 (WG18) and 0.02 to 0.22 (W550). According to the Spearman correlation, the ranking of the breeding bulls in the regions evaluated were different. The mean of Euclidean distance indicated low similarity between ATBR and CGDR (43.20), and ATBR and SPPR (29.24). CGDR and SPPR presented similarity of 17.84. The breed values increased over the years in the traits evaluated. The cumulative variance percentage of the first two main components explained 99.99% variation among the regions, and the weight gains of the animals were the most important to differentiate the regions. A genotype-environment interaction was found for the traits evaluated, thus, the breeding bull selected with superior genetic merit for one region might not be the best for others.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29518/23068,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Net energy for 60 to 120 kg pigs fed low crude protein diets,"Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of dietary net energy content (NE) on performance and carcass traits of finishing barrows fed low crude protein (CP) diets. Pigs (60.0 ± 2.41 kg, Exp. 1; 90.0 ± 2.96 kg, Exp. 2) were allotted in randomized design to four dietary treatments. Exp. 1 had nine pens treatment-1 and Exp. 2 had eight pens treatment-1, with two pigs in all pens. The treatments were as follows: 179 g kg-1 CP and 2589 kcal NE kg-1, 134 g kg-1 CP and 2631 kcal NE kg-1, 134 g kg-1 CP and 2589 kcal NE kg-1, and 134 g kg-1 and 2589 kcal NE kg-1 (pair-feeding to 179 g kg-1 CP and 2589 kcal NE kg-1) in Exp. 1 and 166 g kg-1 and 2604 kcal NE kg-1, 123 g kg-1 CP and 2645 kcal NE kg-1, 123 g kg-1 CP and 2604 kcal NE kg-1, and 12.34% CP and 2604 kcal NE kg-1 (pair feeding to 166 g kg-1 CP and 2604 kcal NE kg-1) in Exp. 2. In Exp. 1, there was no effect of CP or NE on any performance and carcass traits evaluated. In Exp. 2, the greatest result of average daily gain was obtained with 123 g kg-1 CP and 2645 kcal NE kg-1. There was no effect of CP or NE on any other performance and carcass traits evaluated. For 60 to 90 kg barrows, reducing the CP of the diet from 179 g kg-1 to 134 g kg-1, adjusting or not adjusting the NE content of the diets with 134 g kg-1 CP does not compromise performance or carcass traits. For 90 to 110 kg barrows, reducing the CP of the diet from 16.62 to 123 g kg-1, while maintaining the same NE content (2604 kcal kg-1) of the diet with 166 g kg-1 CP does not compromise performance or carcass traits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29346/23067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of different Bacillus thuringiensis strains on the longevity of Africanized honey bee,"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of three strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) on the longevity of workers of Africanized honey bee. Solutions at a concentration of 3 × 108 spores.mL-1 (dosage) were prepared for each strain of Bt (IPS 82, BR 81, and BR 147). Three bioassays were performed as follows: spraying on the bees, contact with the sprayed surface, and candy paste incorporated with Bt. The bees of the Bt bioassay were submitted to histological analysis of the mesenteron. The longevity of workers was assessed from one to 120 hours using different ranges. It was found that the bees that were exposed to the strain of Bt IPS 82, in the spraying test, exhibited a reduced longevity. In the contact test, the BR 147 strain reduced the longevity of the bees. In the food test, in turn, the three studied strains reduced the longevity of the bees as follows: Bt IPS 82: 64.5 hours; Bt BR 81: 64.5 hours; and Bt BR 147: 60.0 hours. The Bt BR 81 strain was considered the most selective of the evaluated strains on Apis mellifera, reducing the longevity of this bee only when it came into contact by the method of ingestion.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29090/23066,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Growth and carcass characteristics of different crosses of broiler chickens reared under an alternative system,"This study aimed to assess the effect of different breeds and crosses of broiler chickens and sex on growth, carcass characteristics, and tissue composition. The experimental design was a completely randomized design in a 6 × 2 factorial scheme, with six genotypes (New Hampshire – NHS, Jersey Black Giant – JBG, Rodhe Island Red – RIR, Indigenous Giant – IG, and the hybrids IG × NHS and IG × JBG) and two sexes (male and female). Each treatment was composed of five replications with three broiler chickens, totaling 180 broiler chickens. Zootechnical performance and growth were assessed through the Gompertz equation parameters. After slaughtering at 105 days, the characteristics of carcass and main cuts were determined by means of weight, yield, and proportion of tissue constituents (meat, bone, and skin). Regarding the Gompertz equation parameters, the genotype NHS presented a higher growth potential. Males presented higher live weight and carcass weights, except for IG. No difference was observed between genotypes and sexes (P > 0.05) for carcass yield. The genotype JBG presented the highest average for breast yield (24.4%). Males presented the highest average for leg yield (30.5%). The genotype IG presented the highest value of breast meat yield (71.2%), being similar to the genotypes from the crosses IG × NHS, and IG × JBG (68.9 and 68.3%, respectively). For meat to breastbone ratio, the genotype IG presented the highest value (3.4) and, considering the sex, females presented a higher average (3.2) for this characteristic. Regarding the proportion of leg meat, an effect was observed for genotype and sex (P < 0.05) with the highest values observed for the hybrid IG × JBG and females (66.3 and 66.0%, respectively). For meat to leg bone ratio, the genotypes NHS, JBG, RIR, and IG × NHS presented the highest values (2.6, 2.7, 2.6, and 2.6, respectively), with females presenting the highest value (P < 0.05) (2.7). The genotypes IG, IG × NHS and IG × JBG presented the best growth and carcass characteristics, being recommended to be reared under an alternative system. Females presented the highest breast yield and, proportionally, the highest amount of leg meat, which are important attributes in a chicken meat production system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28980/23065,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Productive performance of pigs in different breeding stages, housed in a Wean-to-Finish system, with several stocking rates","The objective of the current study was to analyze the productive parameters of pigs housed in single and double capacity in the nursery, growth, and finishing phases in the Wean-to-Finish (WF) system. The research was carried out in the pig sector of the Centro de Ciências Agroveterinárias (CAV) at the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (UDESC), in Lages, Santa Catarina. Ninety male castrated pigs weaned at 28 days of age and with an initial mean weight of 7.91 kg were used. They were housed in a WF shed and divided into two treatments: T1 with three animals per pen, 1.5 m2 of space per animal and 0.38 m of feeder space from weaning until slaughter; and T2 with six animals per pen, 0.75 m2 of space per animal and 0.19 m of feeder space in the nursery phase (up to 63 days old); and three animals per pen, with 1.5 m2 of space per animal and 0.38 m of feeder space for the growth and termination phases. The animals were individually weighed and the average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily weight gain (ADWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated and a randomized design with a total of 10 replicate pens per treatment (with each pen considered an experimental unit) were used. Animals were slaughtered at 161 days of age. The design was completely randomized. We found no significant difference in ADWG, ADFI, or FCR in either the nursery or growth/finish phases and also found no significant difference in carcass yield. Our results show that double stocking pigs in pens is a viable alternative that allows for the best use of facilities during the nursery period on farms that use the WF system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28973/23064,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Ratio of digestible lysine to arginine in Japanese laying quails,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the existence of an interaction between lysine and arginine, and to determine their optimal ratio in the diets of Japanese laying quails. We used 480 quails with an initial mean weight of 180 g at 140 days of age. The quails were distributed in the experimental units in a completely randomized (3 × 2) factorial design, with three levels of digestible lysine (1.083, 1.183, 1.283%) and two levels of digestible arginine (1.472 and 1.580%). There were six treatments, with 10 replicates each, for a total of 60 experimental units. Rations, leftovers, and dead animals were weighed in order to calculate and adjust performance parameters. The variables analyzed were: daily diet consumption (DDC), laying rate (LR), average egg weight (AEW), egg mass (EM), feed conversion per egg mass and dozen eggs (FCEM and FCDE, respectively), weights of yolk, eggshell, and albumen (YW, ESW, and AW, respectively), relative yolk, eggshell, and albumen weights (RYW, RESW, and RAW, respectively), Haugh unit (HU), and marketable egg percentage (ME). There was no interaction (P > 0.05) between the levels of digestible lysine and arginine on the parameters analyzed; independently, these parameters were not affected by lysine and arginine levels. In conclusion, the optimal ratio of lysine and arginine in the diet of laying quails was 1.36: 1.00, which was the lowest used in the present study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28578/23101,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Zootechnical and economic performance indexes of dairy herds with different production scales,"This study aims to estimate the zootechnical and economic benchmarks of milk production systems, analyze production scale effects on dairy farming returns, and identify the system components that best represent the total and effective operational costs. We analyzed 22 size, zootechnical and economic performance indexes from 61 dairy farms located in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The sample of herds were clustered according to three production strata. The results were compared using analysis of variance (normal distribution) and Kruskal-Wallis (non-normal distribution) tests, and post-hoc comparisons were undertaken with Fisher's least significant difference test. The relationship between some variables was tested using the Pearson correlation test. The production scale was best defined by the number of lactating cows (r=0.96) in comparison to the area (r=0.83). The production scale proved to be a suitable criterion for the analyses between different groups of producers, and it is more easily obtained and probably provides more accurate results. The milk production systems studied presented higher zootechnical indexes than those found in average of Brazilian farms, but lower than international indices or technologically advanced farms from other Brazilian regions. A greater production scale is a desirable condition, although it failed to ensure the economic efficiency of the herds studied. The components of total and effective operating costs that had the greatest representativeness were, in descending order, food and labor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27739/23062,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Agronomic features of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum) cv. Roxo under irrigation,"This study aimed to evaluate how different irrigation water depths influence the agronomical features of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum) cv. Roxo. Grass was cultivated in a pasture belonging to the Bovine Sector of the National Agrotechnical School of Caceres – MT. The experiment was a block design with five treatments and four repetitions. Treatments consisted of five water depths: 0 = 0% of available water (AW), 1 = 21% of AW, 2 = 34% of AW, 3 = 74% of AW, and 5 = 100% of AW. Evaluated features were production (dry matter ha-1), plant height, leaf/steam ratio, and stem diameter. Dry matter production of cuts from May and July increased linearly with increasing water depth (P < 0.05). Plant height increased linearly as water depth increased in the cuts of May and September, while the height of July cuts was 71.76 cm under an irrigation depth of 390.77 mm. In May, July, and September cuts, leaf percentage decreased linearly as water depth increased (P < 0.05). An increase of 1 mm in water depth reduced leaf percentage by 0.0936% (May), 0.0295% (July), and 0.0122% (September). Our results indicate that to improve dry matter production, May, July, and September cuts should be irrigated with water depths of 56.03 mm, 601.78 mm, and 577.65 mm, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27565/23061,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of monensin sodium associative to virginiamycin and/or essential oils on the performance of feedlot finished steers,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the associative effect of monensin sodium to virginiamycin and/or essential oils on performance, consumption of nutrients and dry matter, apparent digestibility, feeding behavior and carcass characteristics of feedlot finished steers. The experiment lasted 106 days with 10 days of adaptation and 96-day trial, and had 32 crosses angus steers, average age 12 months and average weight of 376 kg, divided into 16 stalls, the weighing took place every 21 days and at the end of the experiment. The treatments consisted of the combination of the following additives to the diet included: Monensin sodium, 200 mg day-1 (MO); Monensin sodium, a dose of 200 mg day-1 + essential oil dose of 1.5g day-1 (MO+EO); Monensin sodium, a dose of 200 mg day-1 + virginiamycin, 200 mg day-1 (MO+VI); Monensin sodium, 200 mg day-1 + essential oil dose of 1.5g day-1 + virginiamycin day, 200 mg day-1 (MO+EO+VI), each treatment had four repetitions, where each repetitions consisted of a bay with two animals. The MO+VI association in relation to MO only increase in average daily gain (ADG) of 24.44%, 22.35%, 21.10% and 17.31% in weighing 42, 63, 84 and 96 days, similar the combination of MO+EO+VI which provided an improvement of 21.94%, 13.59%, 15.45% and 14.75% respectively in the same weightings. The daily carcass gain and carcass overall gain were higher in associations MO+VI and MO+EO+VI and provided an average gain of 16.67 kg more compared to MO and MO+EO. In the parameters feed efficiency, dry matter intake and nutrient expressed in kg day-1 and percentage of live weight were not observed differences (P > 0.05) between treatments. Data on apparent digestibility, feeding behavior and carcass characteristics did not show statistical difference between treatment, except for fat thickness which was higher when associated with any of the additives to the MO, and farm weight was higher in associations containing VI. Associating MO+VI or MO+EO+VI proved to be best in this work compared to MO+EO or only MO in the diets of steers in termination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27445/23060,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Energy and protein requirements during the growing phase of indigenous goats,"The objective of this study was to investigate both energy and protein requirements for the maintenance and growth of indigenous goats, based on data from two separate studies. Goats were weaned at 79 ± 4.4 days of age, with milk and solid diet intake recorded daily. To determine energy maintenance requirements, 32 kids of 4.90 ± 0.302 kg initial body weight (BW) were used. Ten kids were slaughtered at 5.40 ± 0.484 kg BW to estimate initial body composition, with the remaining kids randomly assigned to one of two DM intake levels: ad libitum and restricted-fed (1.2-times maintenance level). Heat production (HP) was calculated as the difference between ingested metabolizable energy (MEI) and retained energy. Net energy requirement for maintenance (NEm) was estimated as the ?0 parameter of the relationship between HP and MEI [HP = ?0 × exp (?1 × MEI)]. Metabolizable energy required for maintenance (MEm) was calculated iteratively, as HP = MEI. Efficiency of energy utilization for maintenance (km) was calculated as NEm/MEm. The intercept of the linear regression of retained CP on CP intake was used to calculate net protein requirements for maintenance (NPm). Net energy and protein requirement for gain (NEg and NPg, respectively) were obtained using 26 kids fed ad libitum and randomly slaughtered at 5.40 ± 0.484 kg BW (n = 10), 15.8 ± 0.655 kg BW (n = 10), and 26.3 ± 1.27 kg BW (n = 6). The first derivative of the allometric equation (used to calculate energy and protein contents in empty body weight (EBW)) with respect to EBW yielded estimates of NEg and NPg. A Monte Carlo-based method was employed to simulate variation in MEm, NEg, and NPg. This study indicated that the net energy required for maintenance is 310.1 ± 36.7 kJ kg-0.75 EBW, with MEm estimated at 499.1 ± 52.1 kJ kg-0.75 EBW and km equal to 0.62. This study indicated that 1.246 g CP kg-0.75 EBW is required by indigenous kids weighing from 5 to 25 kg BW to meet their NPm. In addition, indigenous goats require between 186.6 ± 2.97 and 214.3 ± 12.9 g CP, and between 5.39 ± 1.49 and 9.74 ± 2.57 MJ to gain one kilogram of EBW. This study may contribute to future adjustments in feeding system energy and protein recommendations for indigenous kids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26632/23058,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Nutritional composition and aerobic stability of wheat and corn silages stored under different environmental conditions,"We aimed to evaluate nutritional quality, fermentation profile, aerobic stability, and dry matter losses in corn (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum 'BRS Umbu') silages. Treatments included uninoculated and inoculated (Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus acidilactici, 1.0 × 105 UFC g-1) wheat silage, corn silage from a conventional hybrid and a transgenic hybrid. Nutritional quality and fermentation profile variables were tested in a completely randomized design. Means were compared using Tukey’s test at 5% significance. An aerobic stability trial was conducted in a factorial design with two silages (wheat × inoculated wheat; conventional hybrid corn × transgenic hybrid corn) and two temperatures (ambient temperature × controlled temperature at 24°C). Data were submitted to ANOVA and means were analyzed by the F test at 5% probability. Inoculation of wheat silage increased dry matter, organic matter, and total carbohydrates, but reduced crude protein by a dilution effect. Regarding the fermentation profile, inoculation reduced acetic acid and butyric acid content, whereas it increased propionic acid in wheat silage. Bt corn hybrid silage showed higher dry matter and lower neutral detergent fiber, whereas transgenic corn silage showed lower content of acetic acid, propionic acid, alcohol, and ammonia. Conversely, Bt hybrid silage showed higher butyric acid. Transgenic corn silage showed higher temperature than the conventional hybrid silage during aerobic exposure. Inoculated wheat silage experienced larger deterioration and dry matter losses during the aerobic stability trial. Temperature control worsened aerobic stability in all treatments, increasing dry matter losses and heating.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27275/23100,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Polioencephalomalacia in ruminants from the semi-arid region of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil","The present study aimed to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratorial, and pathological findings of polioencephalomalacia (PEM) in ruminants from the semi-arid region of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. A total of seven ruminants (five sheep, one cattle, and one goat) with pathological diagnosis of PEM were included. Four cases were associated with thiamine deficiency, on account of chronic ruminal acidosis caused by diets rich in carbohydrate, with mainly concentrates, ground soybean hulls, and melon. Three ruminants from an outbreak of petroleum poisoning presented macro and microscopic lesions consistent with changes of malacia and edema in deep structures of the brain, as described in ruminants with PEM associated with sulfur intoxication. Major macroscopic changes included congestion of cerebral vessels, edema, and herniation of the cerebellum. The most observed microscopic lesions, among all assessed cases, were laminar and segmental neuronal necrosis at different regions of the brain, spongiosis, nuclear pyknosis, and red nucleus neurons. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed nonspecific alterations, requiring its association with epidemiological, clinical, and pathological findings, as the results described here are similar to those reported in toxic diseases with neurological manifestations, such as botulism.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29300/23057,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Epidemiological aspects of cysticercose in relation to hydrographic net at triangulo mineiro, MG, Brazil","Cysticercosis affects cattle, which develop the larva of Taenia saginata after ingesting their eggs, which are released by humans. It is a parasite that is distributed worldwide. The use of geoprocessing allows a better definition of endemic areas and populations that face different levels of risk and thus creates a basis for specific control programs for each farming system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological situation of bovine cysticercosis in four municipalities in the Triângulo Mineiro region (Romaria, Iraí de Minas, Grupiara and Douradoquara), with special attention given to the influence of the hydrographic network on the spatial distribution of the disease. The properties sampled (68) for laboratory and epidemiological analysis (questionnaire) were also georeferenced. The risk factors were analyzed using the ArcGIS 10.1 program. The animals were submitted to immunodiagnostic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot) for the diagnosis of bovine cysticercosis. After confirming the disease focus properties, the spatial distribution of the cases was analyzed in relation to the watershed of the region. The positive results for bovine cysticercosis on the properties of the municipalities of Romaria and Iraí de Minas were grouped together, which was a significant result (p < 0.01). Although the positive results for bovine cysticercosis in the municipalities of Grupiara and Douradoquara were randomly distributed (p = 0.27), the risk factor that proved to be statistically significant in the regression analysis for cysticercosis transmission was the water source from the river/stream. From the analysis of the map based on the hydrography of the region, it can be observed that for the distribution of positive cases for bovine cysticercosis in the properties, the main risk factor was the interference of the rivers and their tributaries that fed the municipalities sampled. This study allowed the identification of the prevalence of the taeniasis-cysticercosis complex in the properties of the sampled municipalities (53.84% in Romaria, 45.45% in Grupiara, 37.03% in Iraí de Minas and 35.29% in Douradoquara). The results from this study will help in the prevention and control of this zoonosis in the researched areas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29116/23099,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Risk factors associated to canine visceral leishmaniasis in Uruguaiana city, Brazil","The present study aimed to evaluate factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in areas with higher seroprevalence of it in Uruguaiana city, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, during the year of 2012. A semi-structured questionnaire with socioeconomic and environmental questions was applied in Leishmania endemic regions of the city. The survey data were analyzed by multivariate statistics and the associations between them were presented as odds ratio within a 95% confidence limit. The relationships between the studied variables showed no statistically significant difference between the dwellings with positive and negative dogs. However, when analyzing the odds ratio, the presence of green areas larger than 10m² turned the house into an area of potential risk for CVL (OR= 2.53). There was no difference among the socioeconomic variables education and income, though the groups with lower education and income showed a higher seroprevalence of CVL. The city of Uruguaiana is already located within the CVL broadcasting area and is taken as an endemic region of the disease, with seropositive dogs in all neighborhoods. Thus, the determinants for an increased Leishmania sp. infection could not be indicated, even so, the maintenance of green areas around the households represented a risk factor for being a potential vector shelter.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28977/23055,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of ad libitum intake of an electrolyte repository in horses that underwent a polo game,"The objective of this study was to assess the effects of an electrolyte and energy repository on the hematologic and biochemical variables of horses after a polo game and compare them to the effects of a commercial electrolyte repository and water. Twelve healthy horses, aged 5 to 10 years, mean body weight 356.25 ± 25.6 kg and in training for polo games, were randomly divided into three groups of four animals each and received one of three treatments. Animals participated in a 7-minute polo game. At the end of the match, they were taken to individual stalls where they received treatments for spontaneous hydration for 6 hours. Treatments were Hydroelectrolytic and Energy Repository (RHE) containing sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, dextrose, maltodextrin and, sucrose; and Commercial Paste (PCO) containing calcium, fructooligosaccharides, glycine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and ad libitum water. The control group (Water) received water. Blood samples were collected as follows: just before the beginning of exercise (T0), immediately after exercise (T1), 3 hours after the end of exercise (T3), and 6 hours after the end of exercise (T6). The volume of voluntary intake was measured at T3 and T6. Packed cell volume and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, creatinine, total protein, plasma glucose, and lactate were measured. Data were submitted to descriptive statistics (mean ± standard deviation), Lilliefors and Cochran & Bartlett tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey or Duncan tests at a 5% significance level. The net volume ingested by the RHE group was higher than the PCO and control groups. In all groups, a reduction in chloride concentration and increases in packed cell volume, protein, creatinine, glucose, and lactate concentrations were observed in T1. These variables returned to the values found at T0 throughout the rehydration phase (T3 and T6). It is concluded that the ingestion of the hydroelectrolytic energy repository does not cause alteration in the biochemical profile of the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27613/23053,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Antibody occurrence of Anti-Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania sp. and Ehrlichia canis in dogs in Bahia State","Toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, and ehrlichiosis are zoonoses that have cosmopolitan distribution and cause important clinical changes in dogs and humans. Dogs are important in the epidemiology and transmission of Leishmania infantum and Ehrlichia canis and serve as indicators of environmental contamination by the transmission of Toxoplasma gondii. The aim of this study was to detect antibodies against T. gondii, Leishmania spp., and E. canis in dogs from Bahia and identify the risk factors associated with infections. Blood samples were collected from 353 dogs from several municipalities of Bahia and the sera were tested using reaction of indirect immunofluorescence (RIFI) for T. gondii and Leishmania spp. and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for E. canis. The data were tabulated and analyzed using EPI-INFO 7.1.5 program. Of 353 samples analyzed, 144 (40.8%) were positive for T. gondii (antibody titer 16-4,096) and 92 (26.1%) were seropositive for Leishmania spp. (antibody titer 40-160). The seropositivity for E. canis was the highest as compared to that of the other agents. Furthermore, 184 (52.1%) samples were positive for antibodies against E. canis. Sixteen (4.5%), 71 (20.1%), and 25 (7.1%) samples were co-infected with T. gondii and Leishmania spp., T. gondii and E. canis, and E. canis and Leishmania spp., respectively, while 20 (5.7%) dogs presented co-seropositivity for all three etiological agents. Risk factors such as age, sex, habitat (stray/not stray), and region of dog’s origin were analyzed; age ( ? 1 year) was significantly associated with T. gondii (p = 0.03) and E. canis (p = 0.02) infection and stray animals were more exposed to T. gondii (p = 0.03) and Leishmania spp. (p = 0.01) infection.

Three treatments were conducted among a total of 120 turkeys; one control group and two treatment groups in which 6 x 102 CFU mL-1 and 7 x 105 CFU mL-1, respectively, of Salmonella Enteritidis was inoculated in the crops. Two birds from each treatment were sacrificed and necropsied at 1, 3, 4, 12, 18, and 24 hours, and 3, 4, 38, and 49 days post-inoculation. We re-isolated Salmonella, measured lymphocytes, and conducted immunohistochemical tests. Six hours post-inoculation, Salmonella was found in the investigated organs (yolk sac, cecum, fragments of spleen, and bursa of Fabricius) with conventional bacteriology and immunohistochemistry, and was continuously detected in almost all analyzed organs until turkeys were four-days old. Further, Salmonella was detected after 38 days in cecum, when the concentration 7 x 105 CFU mL-1 was given. At both inoculation concentrations, the number of lymphocytes was similar; larger quantities were found in the first hour post-inoculation, followed by a gradual reduction, reaching the lowest levels at 24 hours after inoculation. Afterwards, lymphocytes increased discreetly, remaining at the same level until 49 days after inoculation. In conclusion, inoculation concentration influences mitigation, dissemination, elimination, and persistence of this pathogen in turkeys. Lower concentrations promote less invasion as well as lower cell stain and lower lymphocyte count.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27432/25441,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Study of soil physical properties and water infiltration rates in different types of land use,"Studying the changes in soil properties caused by different land uses allows measures to be adopted that will reduce the risk of future negative effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil physical properties and quantify water infiltration for different types of land use in the Santa Catarina Plateau of southern Brazil. The research was conducted on a 1,200 ha rural property. The land use types selected were natural forest (NF), planted pine (PP), crop-livestock integration (CLI), and burned natural rangeland (BR). A sample survey was carried out in nine different areas for each land use. Samples were collected from four soil layers and the soil bulk density (Bd), total porosity (Tp), and macropore (Ma), micropore (Mi), and biopore (Bio) volumes were measured. Water infiltration tests were performed to obtain the initial (ii) and final (fi) water infiltration rates into the soil, and the total amount of water that had infiltrated the soil (Ti). In NF, Bd was lower and Tp was higher than in other types of land use. The forest vegetation (NF and PP) had higher Ma and Bio volumes in the superficial layers of the soil. Water infiltration was markedly different between land use types. The NF had the highest ii, fi, and Ti values followed by PP, whereas the CLI and BR areas had drastically lower infiltration parameters with BR having the lowest values. The variables ii, fi, and Ti correlated positively with Tp, Ma, and Bio, but negatively with Bd.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30042/23045,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Profitability of no-till grain production systems,"In general, the technical and agronomic benefits of no-till farming are widely known and well documented in the literature. However, studies focusing on the economics of no-tillage are scarce. In this context, the objective of this study is to determine whether no-till grain production systems that follow the principles of conservation agriculture are economically profitable by analyzing gross margins per hectare per year over six harvests for the agricultural years 1998/1999 to 2003/2004. In addition, a possible link between profitability and different no-till methods in terms of degree of soil turnover, crop rotation, and whether machinery used in agricultural operations is owned or rented is investigated. For this purpose, the multi-case analytical method was applied to thirteen grain producing family farms in Northern Paraná state, Brazil. Based on the results, two ranges of agricultural production variable costs and gross margins were identified. Higher gross margins were associated with longer use of the no-till system, ownership of machinery and equipment, specialization in grains, rotation of the commercial crops used, and higher variable costs. Lower gross margins were associated with outsourcing of sowing, small-scale cropping, and lack of crop rotation. It is concluded that family mechanized no-till systems of grain production in north Paraná are profitable.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29712/23044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Molybdenum application associated with nitrogen fertilization on yield and physiological potential of wheat seeds,"Molybdenum (Mo) is a micronutrient that plays a fundamental role in the assimilation of nitrogen (N) in plants, and top-dressing N fertilization associated with different forms of molybdenum application can increase the yield and physiological potential of wheat seeds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the yield and physiological potential of wheat seeds treated with different forms of Mo application associated with N fertilization. The experiment was performed using the wheat cultivar CD150 in randomized blocks in split plots, with four replicates. Plots were evaluated for four forms of Mo application: 0 g ha-1 of Mo, seed treatment with 40 g ha-1 of Mo, foliar treatment with 40 g ha-1 of Mo, and seed + foliar treatment each at 20 g ha-1. In the subplots, four N rates (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg ha-1 N) were applied at the start of the tillering phase. We evaluated the following parameters: seed yield, mass of one thousand seeds, germination, first germination count, seedling root and shoot length, electrical conductivity, seedling emergence in sand, emergence speed index, and crude and soluble protein contents. The yield of wheat seeds increased with increasing rates of N in the top-dressing. Nitrogen fertilization associated with different forms of Mo application did not interfere with the crude and soluble protein contents or with any of the parameters related to the physiological potential of wheat seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29234/23043,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Detection of anti-Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp., and anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in stray dogs","Dogs can act as intermediary hosts, reservoirs, and sentinel animals for zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis, toxoplasmosis and leptospirosis, and human contact with domestic animals can spread these infections. These diseases are globally distributed, and are a uniquely severe health issue, since they can infect a great range of animals, including humans. The purpose of this work was to determine the prevalence of anti-Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp., and anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in stray dogs. Blood samples were collected from 181 stray dogs and used for serological diagnosis. Of the analyzed samples, 36.46%, 16.57%, and 9.39% were positive for T. gondii, Leptospira spp., and B. canis. The results indicate that these zoonotic diseases are highly prevalent in stray dogs in the northwestern region of the state of Paraná. The high infection rates for these zoonotics in the canine population is an indication that the environment is contaminated with a variety of different microorganisms, exposing both humans and dogs to different sources of infection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27141/23051,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Isolation and identification of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle slaughtered from an abattoir in Garanhuns, Pernambuco","Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (CMT), members including M. bovis. The sanitary inspection in slaughterhouses has a great importance on public health for the removal of contaminated meat with pathological lesions. Cattle slaughtered in the abattoir of Garanhuns were subjected to macroscopic, histological, bacteriological, and molecular analyses. Lung inspection revealed gross lesions suggestive of tuberculosis. The characterization of tuberculous granulomas was performed by histopathology and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The identification of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was performed on smears with fresh material and histological staining using Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Bacteriological diagnosis was carried out using Stonebrink and Lowenstein-Jensen media, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed from the DNA extracted from colonies for the identification of Mycobacterium spp. We found that 1% (32/3,.180) of the collected lungs showed lesions suggestive of tuberculosis. Histopathological analysis revealed that 65.62% (21/32) samples had granulomatous pneumonia. AFB was detected in 46.88% (15/32) smears and 4.16% (1/24) histological sections, as analyzed by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Moreover, 68.75% (22/32) samples showed bacterial growth and molecular identification 90% (18/20) of the samples were positive for M. bovis and 10% (2/20) for Mycobacterium sp. Thus, microbiological culture and PCR analyses revealed the high rate of bovine tuberculosis in this region, indicative of the need to disclose these results in the interest of public health. Consequently, we emphasize the need for an accurate macroscopic evaluation of lesions suggestive of bovine tuberculosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25307/23050,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Microbiological vulnerability of eggs and environmental conditions in conventional and free-range housing systems,"Although Brazil is currently the world’s eighth largest egg exporter, the shift of consumers towards free-range eggs may present new sanitary challenges. This study aims to evaluate the microbiological vulnerability of eggs and environmental conditions in a farm certified for both conventional and free-range systems using two standard methods (enterobacteria counting and Salmonella spp. survey). Two high-producing farms were selected for this study, one under both conventional and free-range systems at the same place as the test farm, and another under conventional system only as a control farm. Enterobacteriaceae counts were determined for eggshells; and detection of Salmonella spp. was conducted in eggs, nest box material, feeder, and sponge samples from water dispensers, feeders, production plant, besides water samples from nipple dispensers and artesian well. The average enterobacteria count (log CFUmL-1) was 0.09 for conventional and 1.73 for free-range systems (p < 0.001). While Salmonella spp. was not detected in the conventional system but was present in one feeder and three eggshells from the free-range system. Therefore, the conventional system demonstrated better hygiene-sanitary status than the free-range one. Moreover, controlling food safety should always be considered when improving animal welfare.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28906/23048,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,In vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic and technological potential of Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from sheep milk,"Six isolates (Ac1Pd, Ac3Pd, Ac4Pd, Ac5Pd, Ac7Pd, and Ac22Pd) of Pediococcus pentosaceus from sheep milk were tested for safety and for probiotic and technological potential. The results showed that none of the isolates were able to produce biogenic amines or virulence factors. The isolates tested showed low hydrophobicities, high auto-aggregation capacities and co-aggregation with L. monocytogenes ATCC 7644, L. sakei ATCC 15521 and E. faecalis ATCC 19444, but none produced ?-galactosidase and bacteriocins. The isolates did not show growth at pH values 3 and 12, while in a pH range from 4 to 10 the growth was variable. In the absence of bile, all the isolates showed growth, with suppression at bile concentrations of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.6% and 1.0%. In the disc-diffusion test, the isolates tested were resistant to oxacillin, sulfatrimethoprim and vancomycin but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The isolates showed variable responses to penicillin G and were resistant to most of the drugs tested, except for amoxicillin trihydrate and ibuprofen. All cultures showed a high milk-acidification capacity after 24 hours and none produced exopolysaccharides. The isolates of P. pentosaceus were able to produce diacetyl; however, no culture showed extracellular proteolytic activity and the autolysis varied from 21.3% to 30.5% after 24 h. The isolates grew at NaCl concentrations of 4.0 and 6.0%, but the growth was lower at 10.0%. Finally, all the isolates were found to be safe but had limited application as probiotics and in some technological uses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28759/23047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Effect of phosphorus applied as monoammonium phosphate-coated polymers in corn culture under no-tillage system,"The use of phosphate fertilizers as coated polymers reduces phosphorus losses that occur by adsorption of P to soil particles, thereby providing this essential nutrient for a longer period. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of phosphorus doses applied as conventional monoammonium phosphate or as coated polymers on corn grown in a clayey Oxisol, in the Cerrado region. The experiment was conducted in Selvíria - MS, located at 22°22? S and 51°22? W. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design arranged as a 4 × 2 factorial, with four doses of P2O5 (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1) and two sources of phosphorus (monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and monoammonium phosphate coated polymers). The experiment was conducted under no-tillage system during the cropping seasons in 2008/09 and 2009/10. The MAP and MAP-coated sources did not differ in most of the yield components in either of the two seasons. We found a quadratic function adjustment for P doses up to 117 and 98 kg ha-1 of P2O5 for P concentration in leaf tissue and grain yield in the 2008/2009 crop, respectively. We also obtained a quadratic function adjustment for P rates for grain yield and number of plants, up to 118 and 113 kg ha-1 of P2O5, respectively, in the 2009/2010 harvest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30328/23046,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Technical and economic feasibility of irrigated wheat as a function of nitrogen doses, sources, and inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense","Azospirillum brasilense is a bacterium known for its biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in wheat crops. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research defining how much mineral N should be applied to maximize the efficiency of BNF and attain high, economically sustainable yields. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate whether adding urea with N- (n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) urease inhibitor might increase BNF in grasses. The objective was to study the effect of inoculation with A. brasilense, associated with varying doses and sources of N, and economically evaluating the yield of irrigated wheat. The experiment was conducted in Selvíria - MS in crop years 2014 and 2015 in Oxisol soil type that was not-tilled. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications, in a 2 × 5 × 2 factorial scheme, where 2 N sources (urea and Super N - urea with urease inhibitor enzyme), 5 nitrogen fertilization doses in top-dressing (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha-1), were applied to wheat crops with or without the inoculation of A. brasilense. Our results showed that the supply of N through Super N was not economically superior to the use of conventional urea; therefore, we recommend the use of urea because of the ease of acquisition. The application of 140 kg ha-1 of N combined with inoculation with A. brasilense showed higher grain yield. However, the 50 kg ha-1 dose of urea in the absence of inoculation provided greater economic viability in wheat cultivation, but was not sufficient to ensure high profitability with grain productivity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28653/23042,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,"Trends and gaps in the global scientific literature about Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae), a tropical plant of economic importance","Jatropha curcas L., popularly known as the physic nut, is a monoecious, perennial lactiferous species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. Recently, interest in this species has been growing, due to its ability to flourish on degraded land and in soils with low natural fertility, the high oil content of its seeds, its rapid growth and easy propagation, and the identification of several secondary metabolites with medicinal importance. This study aims to report the main trends and gaps in the global scientific literature about J. curcas L, using a scientometric analysis. We have carried out this scientometric analysis on the global literature to identify: 1) temporal publication trends; 2) the quality of scientific production, estimated using citation numbers and journal impact factors; 3) the main journals and countries interested in this topic and the language of scientific divulgation; 4) the main research fields; 5) the use of wild or commercial cultivars; and 6) average authorship levels and international collaboration networks. Our findings have revealed a continuous increase in both quantitative and qualitative parameters in studies about J. curcas. The main trends in physic nut studies involve biofuel production and the plant’s agronomic characteristics. The main knowledge gaps relating to J. curcas are in the fields of forestry, sustainability, animal nutrition, and genetic improvement. Another problem identified in this study is a lack of commercial seeds; none of the studies analyzed have used commercial seeds. India, Brazil, and China together are responsible for 55% of the knowledge about this species, obtained through scientific production. Only moderate international collaboration has been observed between countries, perhaps as consequence of conflicts of interest. Despite an increasing number of articles, some countries have stopped producing J. curcas L, and the worldwide crop production has decreased.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27489/23097,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Severity of leaf diseases in maize inbred lines with different kernel hardness in two sowing seasons,"Resistance of maize inbred lines to major leaf diseases should be characterized for the development of new hybrids in breeding programs. Thus, this study aimed to assess the severity of leaf diseases in maize inbredlines with different kernel hardnessand two sowingseasons. We assessed four inbred lines and one check hybrid with dent kernels and four inbred lines and a check hybrid with flint kernels. Treatments were conducted in two sowing seasons, one in October, and another in December 2013. The symptoms of gray leaf spot (Cercospora zeae-maydis), northern leaf blight (Exserohilum turcicum), and white leaf spot (a complex of Phaeosphaeria maydis and Pantoea ananatis) were assessed every 10 days from flowering. The area under the disease progress curve was also calculated. Severity level of the diseases was higher in inbred lines when compared to the check hybrds (AG8041 PRO and P30R50YH), regardless of kernel hardness. Dent-kernel inbred lines showed a higher severity of northern leaf blight symptoms when compared to flint-kernelones. It is worth mentioning that disease severity increased as sowing was delayed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28603/23040,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Waterborne Giardia and Cryptosporidium: contamination of human drinking water by sewage and cattle feces,"Water is an important vehicle for pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis. In fact, these organisms are responsible for almost 58% and 38% of the waterborne outbreaks reported in ~60 years. Characteristics related to the environmental phase of these protozoa and the different types of hosts are important factors related to environmental contamination. In cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, outbreaks caused by waterborne pathogens are identified as major risk factors for contamination of water resources by untreated sewage and the entrainment of cattle feces in rainwater. Further, this review covers taxonomic, biologic, and epidemiologic aspects such as prevalence, risk factors, and molecular characterization of these protozoa observed in humans and cattle in order to elucidate the role of these hosts in environmental pollution, and consequently, as a source of infection for susceptible humans, especially in rural areas. Alternative water resources such as wells and springs are used without water treatment and potability monitoring. Epidemiological data are useful, but insufficient to characterize the source of infection, thereby requiring the use of appropriate molecular methods for subtyping the protozoa detected in environmental and feces samples as well as for assessing public health risk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26459/21841,E-ISSN 1679-0359
39,2018,Temporal dynamics and management of downy mildew on the table grape ‘BRS Vitória’ in northern Paraná,"Downy mildew caused by Plasmopara viticola is a major disease of grapes in Paraná State, Brazil and other wine-producing regions. The seedless table grape ‘BRS Vitória’ stands out for its tolerance to this disease and is a viable alternative to reduce fungicide applications. The objectives of this study were to analyze the influence of weather-related factors, such as temperature and rainfall on disease progress and to evaluate the efficacy of fungicide spray programs for controlling downy mildew of grapes during the summer-fall and winter-spring crop seasons in northern Paraná, Brazil. Field trials were conducted in Marialva, Paraná, during the winter-spring crop seasons (August to December) in 2013 and 2014 and the summer-fall crop seasons (January to May) in 2014 and 2015. The experimental design used was completely randomized with repeated measurements over the phenological periods, with five treatments and 10 replicates. The following treatments were compared: (1) conventional, in which fungicides were applied according to conventional standards; (2) preventive fungicide sprays every seven days; (3) preventive fungicide sprays every 14 days; (4) fungicide sprays after observing the first downy mildew symptoms; and (5) no fungicide sprays. In the conventional fungicide program, sprays were performed two or three times per week. Treatments 2 and 3 received sprayings between the start of branch budding and fruit ripening. In treatment 4, sprays started from the first occurrence of oil spot symptoms, and then, the applications were spaced every seven days until fruit ripening. The severity of disease was evaluated weekly. The disease was severe only in the 2014 and 2015 summer-fall crop seasons, reaching a maximum severity of 17.3% and 21.3% of the leaf area, respectively. The highest disease severity in the summer-fall crop seasons was associated with higher frequencies of rainy days and higher temperatures. Disease severity in conventional treatments did not differ from severity in treatments with sprayings made every seven and 14 days during the summer-fall crops in both years. Severity index on bunches were not observed for the evaluated trials. The seedless grape ‘BRS Vitória’ is less dependent on the use of fungicides to control downy mildew in northern Paraná.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27531/23039,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,The epidemiological and clinical aspects of Demodex injai demodicosis in dogs: a report of eight cases,"The mite Demodex injai causes demodicosis, an uncommon, chronic, and recurrent parasitic dermatopathy in dogs. Demodicosis is characterized by an excessive proliferation of the Demodex injai mite in the pilosebaceous unit. Typically, demodicosis occurs in adults, and is associated with an underlying disease or a specific host immunodeficiency. Here, we describe the epidemiological, clinical, dermatological, and therapeutic aspects of Demodex injai demodicosis in dogs (n=8) at the Hospital Unit for Companion Animals of the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná in Brazil. The affected dogs were predominantly purebred, had a mean age of eight years, and showed no gender predisposition. The lesions were predominantly alopecic and erythematous-desquamatory, associated with follicular dyskeratosis and greasiness of the coat, and mainly affected the facial region, in addition to the back and limbs. The animals had a history of allergic, dyskeratotic, endocrine, neoplastic, and immunosuppressive comorbidities. The diagnosis of demodicosis was based on multiple skin scrapings, trichogram, and acetate tape impression of the lesion areas, macroscopic observation, and morphological characterization of the mite. Macrocyclic lactones were effectively used for treatment in most cases; however, improvement of the condition may be related to adjunctive treatment of the underlying disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27795/21840,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Dysontogenic metaplasia in cats are scarce and this change may be associated with renal dysplasia and/or lower urinary tract. The animal had history of abdominal enlargement since birth and dysuria, eliminating urine only dropwise. Due to the poor prognosis we opted for euthanasia. At necropsy was observed enlarged and distended bladder, reduced kidneys and dilated and tortuous ureters. The urethra was thickened, hard to cut, and histologically, was replacing the connective tissue, cartilage and endochondral ossification areas, which features dysontogenic metaplasia.

39,2018,Impact of pervious pavement in urban areas on catchment basin recovery,"Urbanization and disorderly occupation of urban areas have created several environmental problems, such as floods. Among the main causes of these problems is soil sealing associated with urban sprawl. Impervious surfaces provide less precipitation to recharge catchment basins by diverting water that should be restored in that region to other basins. This study compares two existing paving systems: concrete pavers with permeable joints and porous concrete pavers. Our objective was to learn which system better promotes the recovery of catchment basins and, consequently, mitigate problems caused by increasing surface runoff in urban areas. In order to reach the results, precipitations were simulated using lysimeters and a rainfall simulation infiltrometer at rainfall rates of 45, 60, and 90 mm h-1. The analyzed paving systems represented characteristics of public sidewalks. This experiment indicates that porous concrete pavers (99.86%) and concrete pavers (99.59%) present mean infiltration similar to that of grass cover (100%) and thereby can promote water infiltration into soil and the recovery of catchment basins in urban areas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28610/23098,E-ISSN 1679-0359

After 78 days of confinement, the animals were slaughtered and body components were recorded. Reconstituted leg weight, total muscle weight, biceps weight and semitendinosus weight showed a negative linear behavior (P < 0.05) with the inclusion of the annatto coproduct in the diet. No effects of the inclusion of annatto coproduct (P > 0.05) were found for leg tissue composition (%), muscle:bone ratio, relative fat or leg muscle. Meat physico-chemical parameters (color, shear force, water retention capacity and cooking losses) were not affected by the inclusion of the annatto coproduct in the diet. The annatto coproduct can be included in up to 300 g kg-1 of dietary dry matter without negative effects to the leg tissue composition (%) and physical parameters of confined sheep meat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27725/21838,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Paraoxonase activity in the serum of peripartum dairy cows with different placental lactogen concentrations,"The action of the bovine placental lactogen (bPL) hormone on maternal metabolism is still poorly known. Some markers, such as the acute phase protein paraoxonase (PON1), are used as indicators of liver function and help to determine the metabolic condition during the transition period in dairy cows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of paraoxonase (PON1) in the serum of peripartum dairy cows with different levels of bPL. Based on the plasma bPL concentration, 18 cows were divided equally into three groups: LOW ( < 2,68 ng bPL mL-1), MEDIUM (2,68–2,80 ng bPL mL-1), and HIGH ( > 2,80 ng bPL mL-1). The experiment was conducted between 21 days prepartum and 28 days postpartum. Serum samples were collected during the experiment for the determination of bPL concentrations and PON1 activity. The bPL concentration was significantly different between the experimental groups (P ? 0,0001) and the days of serum collection (P ? 0,0001). In the prepartum dairy cows, the PON1 levels were different between the groups (P ? 0,05) and the days of serum collection (P ? 0,05). Cows with high bPL concentration had lower serum PON1 activity (P ? 0,05), while cows with low hormone levels had higher enzyme activity (P ? 0,05). In the postpartum period, there was a significant difference between the days of serum collection (P ? 0,0001) and the interaction between groups and collections (P ? 0,01). The group with high concentrations of bPL had lower levels of PON1 (P ? 0,01), while the group with low bPL maintained higher concentrations of PON1 (P ? 0,01). It was concluded that the cows with higher concentrations of bPL in the prepartum period present a reduction in the serum activity of the PON1 enzyme during the peripartum period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29396/21837,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Trans-endoscopic ventriculocordectomy in horses using monopolar electrocautery,"Laryngeal hemiplegia is one of the most common upper airway affections in horses. Laringoplasty is indicated in high-performance animals, and when the only complaint is noisy breathing, ventriculectomy and cordectomy can be performed. This study aimed to establish a minimally invasive surgical approach to ventriculocordectomy in horses, through a videoendoscopic procedure. The technique was developed in two stages, the first one was a cadaveric study and the second one was in vivo, both using two flexible endoscopes. A bilateral ventriculocordectomy was performed in two cadavers, totaling the removal of four vocal cords. In the second stage, a left unilateral ventriculocordectomy was performed in three animals with laryngeal hemiplegia. The vocal cords were pulled by one of the endoscopes with 3.2mm grasping forceps, while the second equipment was used for the resection of vocal cords with a flexible electrode adapted for monopolar electrosurgery (electrocautery). The average time for removal of the vocal cords was 23±5 minutes. In the postoperative care, moderate inflammation around the surgical wound was observed, with complete healing in 21 days in one horse and 28 days in the other two. One animal presented exuberant granulation tissue on the surgical site. Other complications due to the tested technique were not noticed; therefore, it could be a less invasive option for ventriculocordectomy in horses. The developed technique proved to be effective for ventriculocordectomy execution in horses. The main advantages of this approach were reduced surgical time, shorter healing average time, no need for daily dressings and return to normal activities in a shorter period when compared to other surgical approaches. The limitation of the technique consists of the need for two endoscopes for its accomplishment. Further studies, with more animals, are needed to improve the technique.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26740/21836,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Production components and yield of bushing snap bean in conventional and organic production systems,"Production systems influence crops differently, mainly in terms of yield. However, there are few studies that have evaluated different bushing snap bean genotypes in different systems. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the production components and yield of bushing snap beans in conventional and organic production systems. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, in a factorial 6 × 2 arrangement, corresponding to six genotypes and two production systems, with three replications. The genotypes Isla Manteiga Baixo®, Isla Macarrão Baixo®, Feltrin Vicenza Amarelo Baixo®, and Feltrin Macarrão Napoli®, UEL 1, and UEL 2 were submitted to the following determinations: days to flowering; plant height; medium number of pods per plant; average pod mass, length, and diameter; and yield of commercial pods. A joint analysis of variance was conducted by applying the F test, with mean comparison performed using the Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Anthesis of the genotypes Feltrin Vicenza Amarelo Baixo, UEL 2, Isla Macarrão Baixo, and Feltrin Macarrão Napoli is anticipated in the conventional production system. The genotype UEL 2 shows higher precocity in anthesis within the conventional system. The genotypes Isla Manteiga Baixo and UEL 1 produce more pods per plant in the conventional system. In the organic system, the genotype Feltrin Macarrão Napoli produces double the number of pods per plant compared with Isla Manteiga Baixo. The organic system leads to greater plant height and average mass, length, and diameter of pods in relation to the conventional system. The commercial pod yield of bushing snap bean is not altered by differences in the production system or genotype.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25130/21835,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Nutritional evaluation of sorghums grown with different organic fertilizers for slow-growing broilers,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sorghums grown with different organic fertilizers on the chemical composition, energy values, and nutrient metabolizability coefficients, as well as their use for feeding slow-growing broilers. Two trials were performed. In the first experiment, 200 21-day-old broilers were distributed in a completely randomized design (CRD), with five treatments and four replicates of 10 birds per experimental unit. The treatments consisted of a control diet and four test diets (sorghum fertilized with crotalaria, sorghum fertilized with millet, sorghum fertilized with humus, and sorghum without fertilization), including sorghum at 30% in the control diet. The apparent metabolizable energy (AME), apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn), metabolizability coefficients of dry matter, crude protein, and gross energy were evaluated. In trial 2, 200 1-day-old chicks were used in a CRD with five treatments (T1 – control diet with commercial corn, T2 – sorghum fertilized with crotalaria, T3 – sorghum fertilized with millet, T4 – sorghum fertilized with humus, and T5 – sorghum without fertilization) and four replicates of 10 birds per experimental unit. Weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion, and final weight at 28 days were evaluated. The values of AME and AMEn of sorghums fertilized with crotalaria, millet, humus, and sorghum without fertilization were 2894 Kcal kg-1 and 2881 Kcal kg-1; 2736 Kcal kg-1 and 2675 Kcal kg-1; 2727 Kcal kg-1 and 2694 Kcal kg-1; and 2994 Kcal kg-1 and 2959 Kcal kg-1, respectively. The metabolizable coefficients of dry matter, crude protein, and gross energy were 76.04%, 42.01%, and 75.25% for sorghum fertilized with crotalaria; 77.50%, 50.77%, and 75.95% for sorghum fertilized with millet; 77.62%, 46.39%, and 75.54% for sorghum fertilized with humus; and 75.83%, 39.53%, and 74.71% for sorghum cultivated without fertilization, respectively. The dietary use of sorghum cultivated with different fertilizers did not affect (P > 0.05) weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion, and final weight. Green manures with crotalaria, millet, and humus (bovine manure) are alternatives that can be used on sorghum crops because they resulted in grains with adequate nutritional composition, energy values, and metabolizable coefficients for slow-growing broilers from 1 to 28 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29107/21834,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Analysis of the potentiality haying of native forage species in semiarid region,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential hay production from Spiny Amaranth (Amaranthus spinosus), Hairy Woodrose (Merremia aegyptia), Malva (Sida galheirensis), Mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) and Ervanço (Froelichia humboldtiana), native forage species of the semiarid region of Brazil by observing morphological components of the plant, such as the dehydration curve, crude protein loss (CPL) curve, chemical composition of plant and hay and hay degradability in situ. There were differences (P < 0.05) among species on leaf, stem and inflorescence quantification with Ervanço, Hairy Woodrose, and Mucuna having a greater number of leaves. There was a linearly increasing response for the dehydration curve of the five forage plants species. Mucuna forage had the greatest hay point at 800 g kg-1 dried matter (DM) after 11.8 hours and Woodrose had a lower dehydration efficiency, which required 25 hours of sun exposure. There was no difference in CPL. Mucuna had the lowest crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content, 8.4, 67.7 and 73.8 g kg DM-1 in hay in relation to the plant, respectively. Ervanço, Spiny Amaranth, Hairy Woodrose and Malva hay had more of soluble fraction “a” of DM of 31.0, 26.2, 22.1 and 9.7 g kg-1 DM than Mucuna, respectively. Spiny Amaranth and Malva hay had values of 335.4 and 193.2 g kg-1 DM of fraction “b” more than Ervanço hay, respectively. For fraction “a’’ of CP, Spiny Amaranth and Hairy Woodrose hay obtained 312.6 and 227.4 g kg-1 CP more than that observed for Malva, respectively. Mucuna had better hay potential among the forage studied in the semiarid region of Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28962/21861,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Evaluation of internal markers as determinants of fecal dry matter output and digestibility in feedlot sheep,"This study aimed to evaluate the fecal recovery of the internal markers indigestible dry matter (iDM), indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF), and indigestible acid detergent fiber (iADF) and to compare them as estimators of the fecal dry matter output (FDMO) and digestibility of the dry matter (DM) with values observed in total feces collection in trials with feedlot sheep. For this, 82 sampling units from two experiments were evaluated. Internal markers were quantified in the feed supplied, orts, and feces. The recovery of the markers was determined by the comparison of the amount of marker consumed and excreted. Fecal dry matter output and digestibility were determined based on the amount of marker consumed and on its concentration in the feces through individual collections directly from the rectum of the animals, with values compared with those observed in the total feces collection from orthogonal contrasts. The mean bias, the concordance correlation coefficient, and the mean squared prediction error were also evaluated. For all statistical procedures, the critical level of probability for type-I error was fixed at 0.05. The marker iDM showed complete fecal recovery (100.03%) and was efficient in estimating FDMO (482.9 g day-1) and DM digestibility (542 g kg-1) as compared with the values observed in the total feces collection (454.7 g day-1 and 561 g kg-1 for FDMO and DM digestibility, respectively). The iNDF and iADF markers did not show complete recovery in the feces and were not effective in the estimate of FDMO and DM digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29097/21833,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Productive efficiency of mombasa grass in silvopastoral system under pasture deferment and nitrogen fertilizer,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of Mombasa grass in a silvopastoral system and submitted to different nitrogen fertilization rates and pasture management strategies. Treatments consisted of four nitrogen fertilizer doses (0.0, 125.0, 187.5, and 250.0 kg N ha-1 year-1) and three cutting heights (70, 90, and 105 cm). Plant agronomic and physiologic efficiencies, as well as nitrogen use and accumulation by plants, forage production, and increments of forage production, were verified for the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilization was only efficient for grasses cut at 105 cm, where 75% of the applied nitrogen at a dose of 125 kg ha-1 year-1 was recovered. Yet the grasses cut at 70 and 90 cm presented low results for nitrogen fertilization, showing plants with low physiological and agronomic efficiencies. For Mombasa grass in a silvopastoral system, nitrogen fertilization is more efficient when applied at lower doses and for plants cut at higher heights.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28843/21831,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Standardized ileal digestible (SID) isoleucine requirement of barrows (15- to 30- kg) fed low crude protein diets,"This study aimed to determine the SID isoleucine (Ile) requirement of starting barrows fed low crude protein. Two experiments were carried out. Experiment 1: Ten crossbred barrows were used in order to determine the SID AA of the basal diet (treatment with the lowest SID Ile level used in the growth performance experiment), averaging 15.00 ± 0.27 kg of initial weight, individually housed in metabolic cages and allotted in a complete randomized design, with two treatments, five replicates and one animal per experimental unit. Treatments consisted of a basal (14.13% CP and 0.450% of SID Ile) and a free protein diet. Experiment 2: A performance experiment was carried out to determine the SID Ile requirement when using low crude protein diets. Forty crossbred barrows were used, averaging 15.00 ± 0.87 kg of initial weight and distributed in a randomized block design with five treatments (0.450, 0.520, 0.590, 0.660 and 0.730% of SID Ile) and two animals per experimental unit. The average daily gain (ADG) (P=0.049) and protein deposition (P=0.01) were affected by the studied SID Ile levels. The daily need of SID Ile was estimated at 5.9 g when considering 0.61% as the optimum level of SID Ile in the diet for an improved ADG and protein deposition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28437/21860,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Morphogenesis and structure of mombassa grass over different growth periods,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilizer doses on morphogenic and structural characteristics of mombassa grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) at three different periods of the lifespan of tillers. The experiment was conducted in Araguaína-TO, Brazil, from December 2014 to February 2015. It was installed in split plots in a randomized block design with four replications. The doses of N-fertilizer (0, 30, 60, 90 kg N.ha-1) were the plots and the periods evaluated (1PER – first period from day 16 to 30; 2PER from day 31 to 45 and 3PER from day 46 to 60 after germination) were the subplots. The evaluated variables consisted of leaf appearance rate (LAR), leaf elongation rate (LER), stem elongation rate (SER), leaf senescence rate (LSR), phyllochron, tiller number, leaf emergence, and total leaf number. A Pearson correlation analysis was used to morphogenic and structural characteristics along with a regression analysis for all the variables. Overall, increasing N-fertilizer doses positively influenced the leaf appearance and leaf elongation rates, tiller density, and the number of live leaves per tiller. The 90-kg N.ha-1 dose enabled the best morphogenic and structural responses of the forage when compared to the other rates. Each period featured differently, with higher values of LSR, SER, and LER in 3PER when compared to those in 2PER and in 1PER. Therefore, the nutritional supply over the first weeks of tiller lives was defining to an increase in forage production in the remaining periods. In light of this, we observed that as LAR raise in the first days after germination, nutritional supplies are required from day 15 on, mainly nitrogen, so plants could continue their development since initial plant growth determines pasture productive vigor and longevity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27760/21828,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Correlations of the feeding behavior of lambs fed diets containing pearl millet silage with addition of urea,"The aim of this study was to evaluate correlations among the feeding behavior, intake, in vitro digestibility and production parameters of feedlot-finished lambs. Thirty-two male uncastrated mixed-breed lambs with an average initial live weight of 17.39 ± 2.16 kg were distributed into four treatments (diets) with eight replicates (animals) each, as a function of their weight, in a completely randomized block design. Diets were composed of pearl millet silage with addition of levels of urea (0, 2, 4, and 6%, DM basis), ground corn, soybean meal, and a mineral mixture. The experimental period was 62 days, consisting of 10 days of adaptation and 52 days of data collection. Positive correlations were observed (P < 0.05) for rumination time and feeding efficiency in dry matter with the intakes of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), organic matter (OM), and non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC). Negative correlations were detected (P < 0.05) between rumination efficiency in NDF and the intakes of DM, EE, NDF, OM, and NFC. Correlations were negative (P < 0.05) between the number of chews per cud and the digestibilities of DM, NDF, NFC, and TDN. The number of chews per day was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with the digestibility of NDF and with TDN. Rumination time had a positive correlation (P < 0.05) with average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FE). Feeding efficiency in DM was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with ADG and FE, whereas rumination efficiency in NDF was negatively correlated with ADG and positively with feed conversion. The increase in feeding efficiency for dry matter generated positive effects on nutrient intake, weight gain, and feed efficiency of the lambs fed diets containing pearl millet silage with addition of urea.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28592/21830,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Chito-oligosaccharide as growth promoter replacement for weaned piglets: performance, morphometry, and immune system","The objective of this study was to evaluate the chito-oligosaccharide (COS) against two growth promoter antibiotics, colistin and lincomycin, with respect to growth performance, incidence of diarrhea, visceral characteristics, morphometry, and serum immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgG, and IgM). A total of 96 Pen Ar Lan® piglets (48 barrows and 48 females), weaned at 17 days and with body weight (BW) 5.33 ± 0.37 kg, were subjected to the evaluation of growth performance and serum. Twenty-four animals, females, 35-day-old and with BW 6.86 ± 0.64 kg, were used for the assessment of histology and visceral organ weight. The three treatments were a basic diet formulation supplemented with COS (100 mg kg-1), colistin (40 mg kg-1), or lincomycin (4.4 mg kg-1). The antibiotic treatments showed higher average daily gain (ADG) than COS treatment during the period of 49 to 63 days; whereas the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was higher and incidence of diarrhea was lower for the colistin treatment than for other treatments. The spleen weight and the small intestinal length were higher and duodenal pH was lower for COS than for antibiotics. Morphometry indicated greater villus height and higher ratio of villus height to crypt depth with colistin than with COS and a lower lesion score compared with other treatments. The serum IgA concentration was higher for COS in 35-day-old piglets. According to the results, COS was not efficient to replace colistin as a growth promoter for piglets weaned at 17 days; however, the results related to the immune system suggested that COS is a potentially promising product during weaning.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27597/21827,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Beef cattle production in established integrated systems,"The aim of the current study is to assess three integrated systems presenting different eucalyptus tree densities due to animal and forage production. The following integrated systems were assessed: crop-livestock-forest with 357 eucalyptus trees ha-1 (ICLF1); crop-livestock-forest with 227 eucalyptus trees ha-1 (ICLF2); and crop-livestock with 5 remnant native trees ha-1 (ICL). The randomized block experimental design was applied in a split-plot scheme with four replicates. The Average Daily Gain (ADG, g animal-1day-1) and the live-weight gain per area (LWG, kg ha-1) were applied to analyze animal performance, which was set by weighing the animals every 28 days (the animals previously fasted for 16h). Forage yield was higher in ICL during fall and winter; in summer, it did not differ from ICLF2. There was no forage yield difference between the ICL and ICLF2 systems in any of the assessed seasons; summer was more productive in ILPF1 than other seasons. The highest leaf crude protein contents (CP) in summer was recorded in systems ICLF1 and ICLF2, and the highest value recorded in fall was found in ILPF1; the lowest was found in ILP. On the other hand, the highest leaf NDF contents in summer were found in ILP. The highest ADG were found in summer. The highest LWG values recorded for the ICL and ICLF2 systems were collected in summer and fall; there was no difference in any of the three systems in winter. The LWG was higher in all system in summer. The ICLF2 emerged as the system (with trees) most appropriate for beef cattle production. Despite the shading interference on forage production, such condition is compensated by the best nutritional contents such as CP. The ICLF2 system allowing an annual LWG of 83% in relation to the ICL system during the fifth year of establishment of the systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27442/21826,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Electrical conductivity and somatic cell count in zebu cow’s milk,"The objective was to evaluate the physico-chemical composition, somatic cell count and electrical conductivity of the milk from lactating Zebu cows. For this, monthly milk samples were collected on the official milk control day intended for analysis of electrical conductivity of milk (ECM), somatic cell count (SCC) and milk composition. We used monthly data from 680 controls, from 10 Gyr and 17 Guzerat cows from a herd located in the city of São Gonçalo do Amarante/RN, from August to November 2013. Analyses of variance, mean test and Pearson correlation analysis were conducted. The levels of fat (% F), protein (% P), lactose (% L), total solids (% TS) and non-fat dry extract (% NFDE) were dependent variables for the ECM and SCC. The milk of Gyr cows for ECM, SCC, GOR, PROT, LACT, TS and NFDE were respectively, 3.88±1.18 mS/cm, 1629±2195 thousands cells/mL, 4.71±1.77%, 3.29±0.31%, 4.5±0.33%, 13.5±1.78%, 8.79±0.37%, and for the Guzerat breed 3.59±0.88 mS/cm 1356±1793 thousands cells/mL, 4.47±0.98%, 3.43±0.32%, 4.52±0.24%, 13.5±1.19%, 9.02±0.48%. No significant correlations between SCC and ECM characteristics were observed. However, when the correlation of each of these parameters and milk composition in different classes for each breed was analyzed, a significant correlation of the SCC was observed with the protein and lactose in Gyr, of the ECM with the lactose and SCC with total solids and fat for the Guzerat cows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27414/21825,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Effect of supplementation frequency in feeding behavior, displacement patterns and forage intake of beef heifers","Our work was carried out to evaluate forage intake, feeding behavior and displacement patterns of beef heifers fed exclusively on pasture or receiving oat grain, either daily (“frequent”) or from Monday to Friday (“infrequent”), in two phenological stages of Alexandergrass (Urochloa plantaginea Link.): “Vegetative” and “Reproductive”. The grazing method was continuous, with a variable number of animals. The experimental design was completely randomized with measures repeated in time with three feeding frequencies and two phenological stages. Forage intake was estimated using the chromic oxide technique as an indicator of fecal output. Heifers on exclusive Alexandergrass pasture and frequently supplemented had higher forage intake of dry matter (DM, 2.91 kg DM 100 kg BW-1) than those that were infrequently supplemented (2.00 kg DM 100 kg BW-1). Forage intake was greater in the “Vegetative” stage. The use of feeding stations is modified in response to supplementation frequency and phenological stages of Alexandergrass. Bite mass was higher for daily supplemented heifers, and these animals spent less time grazing. Also, bite mass was the item that best explained DM total ingestion. Bite mass and grazing time were similar throughout the phenological stages, whereas bite rate decreased in the reproductive stage. Feeding behavior and forage intake responses of beef heifers were influenced by supplementation frequency and phenological stages of Alexandergrass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27391/21824,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Productivity of Urochloa brizantha ‘Marandu’ influenced by strategic rest periods and nitrogen levels,"The effects of two strategic rest periods and associated nitrogen levels on the agronomic and productive characteristics of Urochloa brizantha ‘Marandu’ were evaluated. The trial was conducted in a completely randomized 4 × 2 split-plot design, with four blocks. The treatments consisted of associations between two rest periods and four nitrogen levels. The rest periods included one at the end of 28 days (RP28days) and another when the canopy height was 40 cm (RP40cm) and nitrogen levels of 0, 150, 300, and 450 kg N ha-1 year-1 was applied as ammonium sulfate. The following variables were evaluated: rest period (RP) per cycle, total dry matter (TDM), dry matter (kg ha-1) and proportion (%) of leaf blade (LB), stem, and senescent material (SM), tiller mass, forage density, leaf area index, height, leaf:stem ratio, and crop growth rate (CGR). The variables height, TDM, LB dry matter, stem dry matter, CGR, and forage density exhibited a linear relationship with RP28days and a quadratic relationship with RP40cm with increasing N levels. The proportions of LB and stem had linear relationships with N levels for RP28days and RP40cm. The leaf:stem ratio was affected by increasing N levels and it fit the quadratic model for both rest strategies. The SM proportion had a quadratic relationship only with RP28days. The tiller mass had a linear relationship with RP28days, whereas SM dry matter showed a linear relationship for RP40cm. The use of the RP40cm reduced the period needed to begin a new grazing cycle. The level of 450 kg N ha-1 is recommended for RP28days and levels between 380 to 400 kg N ha-1 provided better results for RP40cm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26044/21823,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Intercropping of sunflower with Brachiaria brizantha cultivars during two sowing seasons in the interim harvest,"Intercropping of annual crops with tropical forages is an effective cultivation method to maximize grain production and pasture formation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of sunflower and the productive and nutritional characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha cultivars grown with intercropping during two different sowing seasons in the interim harvest of the Center-West region of Brazil. The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Rio Verde, Goiás (GO), using a randomized block design with a 3x2+4 factorial scheme and three replicates per treatment. The following factors were tested: three Brachiaria brizantha cultivars (Marandu palisadegrass, Piata palisadegrass and Xaraes palisadegrass) grown with intercropping in the inter-row with the sunflower cultivar Charrua in two different sowing seasons (February and March); four additional treatments of sunflower; and the three tested Brachiaria brizantha cultivars grown in monoculture. Intercropping of sunflower with the Xaraes palisadegrass cultivar negatively affected the agronomic characteristics of sunflower, and intercropping with Marandu palisadegrass and Piata palisadegrass cultivars is recommended. Preference should be given to the Xaraes palisadegrass cultivar for forage production and to the Piata palisadegrass cultivar for the production of forage with higher nutritional value. Sowing in March led to the best sunflower agronomic characteristics, without affecting the productive and nutritional characteristics of the forages. Intercropping of sunflower with Brachiaria brizantha cultivars is therefore a promising cultivation method for the production of achenes and forage during the inter-harvest in the Center-West region of Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20973/21821,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Biomass flows and defoliation pattern of ryegrass grazed by supplemented heifers,"To strategically define the best stocking rate management strategy for ryegrass, it is important to know the growth process of forage plants in detail. The study was conducted to analyze the leaf biomass flows and the defoliation intensity and frequency of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) grazed by heifers fed exclusively on pasture or on pasture and supplemented with corn or white oat grain. The experimental design was completely randomized following a repeated measures arrangement with three feeding systems and three area replications. Biomass flows (kg DM leaf blades ha1 day1) for leaf growth (40.6), leaf senescence (40.7), and leaf intake (29.7) were similar in the different feeding systems. Leaf blade intake adjusted to body weight was lower in supplemented heifers regardless of grain type. Actual and potential utilization efficiencies and ryegrass biomass net balance were not affected by feeding system. The leaf intake flow was 1.4 times lower than the growth flow, resulting in an actual utilization efficiency less than one (0.7), whereas the senescence flow was higher than the growth flow, resulting in a negative potential utilization efficiency (0.2). Leaf defoliation intensity was similar (54.4%) across feeding systems and defoliation frequency was higher in supplemented heifers. The 29.2% increase in stocking rate of heifers fed corn or oat grain as supplement did not affect the dynamics of ryegrass biomass flows, but reduced leaf blade intake adjusted to heifer body weight leading to alterations in the defoliation frequency of ryegrass pasture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21120/21822,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Optimal quadrat area and sample size to estimate the forage mass of stargrass,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the sample size and area of the quadrats necessary to accurately estimate the forage mass (FM) of a fenced pasture of stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis cv. Florico) during the winter. Five metal quadrats were used: a 0.09 m² square (0.30 m side), a 0.25 m2 square (0.50 m side), a 0.25 m2 circle (0.28 m diameter), a 0.5 m2 rectangle (0.5 x 1.0 m), and a 1 m2 square (1.0 m side), each with eight replicates. The size and shape of the quadrats were determined based on cumulative variances to identify combinations that minimized the coefficient of variation (CV). The minimum sample size required to estimate the FM, morphological components and height was established by the CV maximum curvature method. The 0.25 m2 square quadrat (0.5 m side) presented the lowest cumulative CV in estimating the FM and the dry mass of dead material. However, for the estimation of the leaf and stem dry mass, the 1.00 m2 square quadrat (1.00 m side) presented the lowest CV. Using the 0.25 m2 square quadrat, a minimum number of six samples were required for the FM estimation, and eight samples were required for estimating the mean height of the stargrass pasture. Therefore, at least eight samples are recommended to obtain accurate results for the estimation of both variables.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20161/21819,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Serological and molecular findings in diagnosis of leptospirosis serovar hardjo in a dairy bovine herd,"The cattle are considered hosts of the Hardjo serovar, causing economic damages due to the reproductive failures like abortions and infertility. The serovar Hardjo usually remains in the reproductive tract and also in the renal tubules where it is eliminated intermittently in the urine for months. Placental remnants, the aborted fetus and contaminated urine promote the permanence of this bacterium within the herd for years. Thus, the objective of this study was to monitor for prolonged period, cows naturally infected with Leptospira ssp. through microbiological culture, serological examination and DNA detection of the pathogen in the urine. The dairy herd was composed of 50 breeding cows with a history of abortion and infertility, without leptospirosis vaccine and located in the northern region of Paraná. Blood and urine samples were collected and laboratorial diagnosis were performed five times at intervals of four months. Blood samples were collected from the all 50 animals and the serum was submitted to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for the detection of anti-leptospira antibodies. Of the total cows, 20 showed antibody titres ? 1: 100 in MAT and urine samples were collected from only those animals with higher titers to perform nested-PCR (n-PCR) and bacterial isolation per culture. In addition, two urine samples from five animals with antibody titers < 1: 100 were collected in MAT for n-PCR. Serovar Hardjo was considered the most frequent during the serological monitoring of the animals evaluated. The n-PCR technique was able to detect leptospiral DNA in the urine of animals with MAT ? 1: 100 antibody titers and urine from animals whose titers were < 1: 100. Sequencing of the leptospiral amplicons shared 100% nucleotide sequence identity with the Leptospira interrogans species. Positive n-PCR results from animals with titers of < 1: 100 suggest that the cut-off of MAT is could be not sufficient to detect renal carriers, so it is also important to use n-PCR as an additional diagnostic tool for identify infected animals with Hardjo serovar and whose serology was negative.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28934/21818,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of Flunixin Meglumine administration on seminal characteristics of male sheep and goat,"Testicular degeneration is a multifactorial process increasing the concentration of prostaglandins in seminal plasma. Both increase and decrease of these hormones tend to promote loss of seminal quality. Flunixin meglumine is a potent anti-inflammatory drug capable of modulating the production of prostaglandins and is widely used in female reproduction. However, it is rarely used in males with the same objective. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of this drug on seminal quality of male lambs and goats with spermatic characteristics unfavorable for reproduction. To this end, a total of 15 breeding animals were evaluated, of which six goats and four sheep with poor seminal quality were selected according to the criteria established by the Brazilian College of Animal Reproduction (CBRA). Three semen samples were collected from each animal. Then, the flunixin meglumine treatment was initiated and ejaculates were collected at two different periods after the drug was administered (from day 21 until day 35 and from day 49 to day 63). Macroscopic and microscopic parameters were assessed in semen samples and scrotal circumference and percentages of sperm pathologies were measured and compared between the three periods. Data with normal distribution were analyzed using ANOVA at 5% probability, and comparisons between periods within the same species were performed using the Tukey test. An improvement was observed in the analyses of mass motility, percentage motility, and sperm vigor. Scrotal circumference had no variation. Concerning sperm pathologies, an increase in the number of normal spermatozoids was observed due to a significant reduction in minor and major defects, and the latter remained low even after the treatment was finished. Therefore, flunixin meglumine presented beneficial effects on seminal parameters of male goats and lamb with unfavorable spermatic characteristics. These findings indicate this drug may be used in the treating of males with testicular injuries or of breeders with reduced seminal quality due to advanced age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28842/21817,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Epidemiological data and a score-based study of renal, hepatic and cerebral lesions in feline infectious peritonitis","The study describes the epidemiological and pathological findings observed in a population of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and estimated the degree of tissue destruction in the kidney, brain, and liver. A retrospective study was performed to determine the number of cats with a histopathological diagnosis of FIP between 2005-2016, at the Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Universidade Estadual de Londrina. The histopathological alterations in selected organs (brain, liver and kidneys) associated with FIP were described and then compared with a scoring system to estimate the degree of tissue destruction. FIP was diagnosed in 3.7% (19/520) of all cats necropsied during the 11-year period; sexual and breed predominance were not identified. Cats that were less than one-year-old were more frequently diagnosed with FIP. Pyogranulomatous nephritis with vasculitis (94.7%; 18/19), coagulative renal necrosis (84.2%; 16/19), hepatocellular necrosis (57.9; 11/19), and necrotizing leptomeningitis (47.4%; 9/19) were the most frequent lesions observed. Moreover, FIP-associated renal lesions were more severe and frequently observed when compared with those in the brain and liver. It is proposed that necrosis be considered as an important lesion associated with FIP that should be included in the histopathological diagnosis of this disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28591/21816,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Natural and experimental poisoning by Cestrum laevigatum (Solanaceae) among cattle in the Agreste region of Paraíba, Brazil","An outbreak of natural poisoning by Cestrum laevigatum was reported among cattle in the Agreste region of Paraíba, which affected six out of 20 animals. Four animals were found dead and two presented clinical signs, including, dyspnea, drooling, jugular vein engorgement, muscle tremors and ataxia, which subsequently progressed to recumbence and death. An experimental poisoning was performed in two bovines who were administered single doses of 35 g kg-1 and 50 g kg-1 body weight (BW), respectively, of fresh leaves and fruits. The animal that received 35 g kg-1 BW had mild clinical signs, consisting of apathy, salivation and reduced ruminal movements with recovery 30 hours after the onset of initial signs. The animal that received 50 g kg-1 BW showed apathy, dry stool, drooling, hyperexcitability, head pressing, opisthotonos, nystagmus, miosis, jugular and episcleral vessel engorgement, ruminal atony, muscle tremors, ataxia, falling, seizures, and sternal recumbence, followed by lateral recumbence, with death occurring 21 hours and 37 minutes after ingestion. The enzyme activities of aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase in the serum increased significantly 18 hours after the administration of the plant. The primary gross lesions in the natural and experimental cases were enlarged livers, with rounded edges and accentuation of the lobular pattern on the capsular and cut surfaces. Histopathology revealed diffuse centrilobular coagulative necrosis with hemorrhages and congestion, and the presence of degenerated hepatocytes in the midzonal regions. Based on the epidemiological and clinicopathological data, we concluded that C. laevigatum was responsible for an acute hepatotoxic disease among cattle in the Agreste region of Paraíba.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27790/21815,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Phytochemical analysis and acaricidal activity of Aloe arborescens Mill. extracts against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus,"The indiscriminate use of chemical acaricides has allowed Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus to develop resistance to several active principles. However, botanical extracts have been tested as an alternative method to control those ticks. This experiment studied the chemical fingerprint and acaricidal effect of fresh and dry Aloe arborescens Mill. extracts on R. (B.) microplus. The acaricidal activity of extracts was assessed using in vitro assays with engorged females, and phytochemical characterization was performed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that fresh and dry A. arborescens extracts prepared with the solvents pure ethanol, ethanol-dichloromethane binary mixture, and ethanol-dichloromethane-acetone ternary mixture, contained water-soluble tannins and had a strong effect on the reproductive parameters of R. (B.) microplus demonstrated by a marked decreased in the number of eggs laid and in the larvae hatching rate (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001). In conclusion, A. arborescens Mill. has components with acaricidal activity against R. (B.) microplus, and phytotherapy with extracts of this plant may be used as an alternative method of R. (B.) microplus control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27239/21814,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,The impact of bacterial contamination of the ejaculate and extender on the quality of swine semen doses,"The aim of this study was to verify the influence of the degree of bacterial contamination of boar ejaculate and semen extender on the quality of semen doses. The experiment was conducted in four boar studs, from which raw semen and two semen doses from each ejaculate were collected to evaluate the number of colony-forming units (CFU), pH, sperm morphology and motility. Extender samples were also evaluated for CFU. Ejaculates that had higher levels of contamination ( > 220 CFU mL-1) resulted in semen doses with a greater degree of bacterial contamination but with no reduction in motility or alteration in pH. When the semen doses were classified according to the degree of contamination of the extender, a decrease in motility was observed after 108 and 168 h of storage (P < 0.05) in the group whose extender had ? 14,000 CFU mL-1 versus the group whose extender had ? 330 CFU mL-1. The pH remained stable during 168 h of storage in semen doses with extender that had lower contamination levels, but decreased from 7.2 to 6.0 between 24 and 168 h of storage (P < 0.05) in the group with extender that had higher levels of contamination. A higher number of abnormal acrosomes (P < 0.05) were observed after 168 h of storage in the semen doses whose extender was highly contaminated. The production of semen doses with low bacterial contamination and high sperm cell viability will only be possible with a strict hygienic control in semen processing, primarily with respect to the extender, combined with minimal contamination during collection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26455/21811,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Goniometric study of young and adult Saanen goats,"Using the goniometric method, it is possible to take measures of extension, flexion, abduction, and adduction of a synovial joint. The aim of this study was to use goniometry to compare flexion and extension of fore and hind limbs of Saanen goats at different ages. Flexion and extension angles of the shoulder, elbow, and carpus joints, as well as of the thigh, stifle, and tarsus joints, were measured using a standard goniometer on 10 six-month-old goats and on 15 three-year-old goats. The range of motion was reduced in all joints of the adult animals compared to that of the younger animals, but the difference was statistically significant only for the shoulder, elbow, stifle, and tarsus. It was noted that the greater muscle volume of adult animals influenced the flexion capacity of limbs (statistically verified for all joints), whereas young animals reached a more complete flexion with smaller angles than in adults. Therefore, we have shown that age affects goniometric measurements of synovial joints in Saanen goats. Such data may be useful in evaluation of joints in other goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25942/21809,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effects of age and sex on blood biochemistry of dorper lambs,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physiological variations and influence of age group and sex on biochemical variables of 32 male and female Dorper sheep at the age of 15 to 121 days. Four blood samples were collected from each animal, at monthly intervals, totaling 128 samples. Biochemical variables determined in each sample were total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), albumin/globulin ratio (A/G), glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (tCHOL), high density cholesterol carrying lipoproteins (HDL-C), low density cholesterol carrying lipoproteins (LDL-C), very low density cholesterol carrying lipoproteins (VLDL-C), urea, creatinine (CRE), total calcium (tCa), ionized calcium (iCa), phosphorus (P), calcium/phosphorus ratio (Ca/P), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The results were obtained in four moments according to age: M1 - sheep from 15 to 30 days, M2 - sheep from 45 to 61 days, M3 - sheep from 74 to 90 days and M4 - sheep from 105 to 121 days. Comparing the values of the biochemical variables among the four age groups studied a significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed in the concentrations of all the variables evaluated except for Na, Cl and ALT. Sex did not influence (p > 0.05) the values of the biochemical variables analyzed. Based on the results, it is concluded that the age groups exert a significant influence on the majority of blood biochemical variables of Dorper sheep from 15 to 121 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26313/21810,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Anthelmintic efficacy of Cratylia argentea (Desv.) Kuntze against the gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep,"The use of natural products having therapeutic properties can be considered an alternative approach for the control of helminths in ruminants, reducing the indiscriminate use of chemicals as well as production costs. The anthelmintic effectiveness of Cratylia argentea on sheep endoparasites was evaluated both in vitro by assessing the number of third-stage larvae recovered per gram of feces (LPG) from coprocultures treated with pods/ground seeds, macerated leaves or vermiculite (control), and in vivo using the Fecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) in two groups of lambs (n = 8/group) that received 1 mL kg-1 body weight of C. argentea solution (treated group) or distilled water (control group) orally. When compared to control group, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of LPG in the leaves group (55.88%; p ? 0.05) and pods/ground seeds group (82.48%; p ? 0.01). There was no significant reduction (p > 0.05) in the average count of EPG upon treatment with the aqueous solution of C. argentea. These findings suggest that C. argentea extract mainly obtained from pods/ground seeds has a promising potential for the control of young stages of gastrointestinal nematodes. However, further studies are needed to validate the use of C. argentea as an alternative method for the control of parasitic diseases of ruminants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27214/21812,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of dietary supplementation with omega-3 and -6 on fresh and frozen/thawed sperm quality of dogs,"For years, fatty acids have been recommended as a dietary supplement to improve canine hair. For animal reproduction, supplementation with omegas has been used to increase the reproductive efficiency and conception rate, but few studies have been conducted in dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of daily dietary supplementation with omega-3 and -6 on the quality of fresh and frozen/thawed semen in canines. Semen was collected from seven dogs and evaluated for sperm motility, vigor, concentration, and morphology. The 17-week study included 119 ejaculates and was divided according to oral supplementation with omega-3 and -6: M1 (1st-5th week) or pre-supplementation; M2 (6th-9th week) and M3 (10th-13th week) or during supplementation; and M4 (14th-17th week) or post-supplementation. After analysis, the semen was frozen and then revaluated both immediately and 30 minutes (at 37° C) after thawing. Supplementation with omegas increased sperm motility, vigor, and concentration; however, supplementation had no influence on semen freezability. In addition, there was no improvement in sperm motility after supplementation when the thawed cells were maintained at 37° C for 30 minutes. We concluded that dietary supplementation with omega-3 and -6 for 4 to 8 weeks can improve the quality of fresh semen, although it has no effect on the freezability of canine semen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25871/21866,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Epidemiological analysis of Toxoplasma gondii infection in sheep in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil","The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in sheep from the Agreste and Sertão regions of Pernambuco in Brazil and to analyze the risk factors associated with T. gondii infection. A total of 250 sheep from 14 sheep farms across the state of Pernambuco were used as samples. Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) was used for the detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies, adopting a cut-off dilution of 1:64. In order to determine risk factors, farm owners were subjected to a questionnaire form enquiring about the aspects of operational hygiene and sanitary systems. Thirty-four of the 250 samples (13.60%, 95% CI= 9.61% - 18.48%) in the study were determined to be positive, and 10 out of 14 (71.42%) of the sheep farms showed at least one seropositive animal. Titers for the 34 positive samples presented 8 samples at 64 (23.53%), 3 at 128 (8.82%), 3 at 256 (8.82%), 13 at 512 (38.23%), and 7 at 1024 (20.60%). After regression logistics, only the supply of silage (p= 0.009; OR=2.79, CI 95%= 1.29 - 6.0) was confirmed as a risk factor. The study was able to conclude that infection with T. gondii was prevalent in the sampled sheep farms in the state of Pernambuco, and that it was imperative to adopt preventive measures in order to effectively curb the identified risk factors.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25540/21807,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Auricular pavilion arteriography in cattle,"Although bovine auricular pavilion has been considered to have large surface vessels, descriptions of its vascularization are scarce. Notwithstanding this region has been used as an alternative route of administration of drugs. With help of an Anatomical specimen, arteriography and dissection have revealed a vast vascular network in the auricle. In this sense, once considered, this knowledge is capable of minimizing prospective complications from the unsuitable use of this region for therapeutic and anesthetic procedures. This study aimed to standardize and describe the arteriography of bovine auricular pavilion in order to acquire a greater knowledge about the local vasculature. Five steers, about one-year-old and weighing about 200 kg, were used, among which three Holstein x Gir crossbred and two Gir purebred. None had lesions in the ear. Of these, two animals were submitted to the standardization of procedures for arteriographies; two others underwent the examination itself. Another bovine, from necroscopy, was subjected to dissection of the ear. The arteriographic images and anatomic dissection pictures were compared to describe anatomical relationships. Arteriography enabled the visualization of lateral, lateral intermediate, intermediate, medial intermediate auricular branches, as well as the medial auricular branch. Conversely, the dissection of the superficial cervicoauricular muscle, between the auricular pavilion and the cornual process base, indicated a poor subcutaneous vascularization of this region, contrasting the rich vascularization near the auricular pavilion. The auricular pavilion arteriography identified a complex vascular network, which in terms of a practical application precludes the administration of slow-absorption drugs in this area. Nevertheless, the dissection images showed the poor subcutaneous vascularization of superficial cervicoauricular muscle surrounding area, making this site more favorable for the administration of long-acting substances.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24644/21805,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Sensitivity and specificity of indirect ELISA for the detection of antibody titers against BVDV from beef cattle raised in Pará State,"The aims of this study were to establish the prevalence of anti-bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) antibodies (Ab) in beef cattle raised in Pará state, to compare the prevalence of seropositive animals to BVDV using a commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (iELISA) and the virus neutralization (VN) test, and finally, to determine the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the iELISA for the detection of anti-BVDV Ab using VN as a gold standard. A total of 400 serum blood samples from Nelore cows aged at least 24 months from five farms in the Pará state from two mesoregions (Metropolitan Region of Belem and Northeast of Pará) were analyzed. All animals were vaccinated against brucellosis and foot-and-mouth disease. The examination of anti-BVDV Ab with VN was performed in the Laboratory of Bovine Viruses of the Biological Institute of Sao Paulo as described in the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. For VN, bovine kidney epithelial cells from the Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) strain were used. The determinations of anti-BVDV Ab were performed with the iELISA test at the Laboratory of Immunology and Microbiology of the Federal Rural University of Amazonia according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The results were classified as follows: (a) correct positive diagnosis, (b) incorrect positive diagnosis, (c) correct negative diagnosis, and (d) incorrect negative diagnosis, according to the results obtained from VN. From the values obtained from VN and iELISA, Se [(a ÷ a + d) × 100], Sp [(c ÷ c + b) × 100], positive predictive value [(a ÷ a + B) × 100], and negative predictive value [(c ÷ c + d) × 100] were calculated for iELISA. The frequencies (%) of seropositive animals were determined and compared both between the different tests (iELISA and VN) and between the different farms (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The statistical analysis was performed with a significance level of 5%. The prevalence of seropositive animals was found to be different (P < 0.0001) using VN (39.25% [157/400]) and iELISA (54.50% [218/400]). It was observed that the Se and Sp of the iELISA assay were 98.72% and 74.07%, respectively. Of the total, 25.93% (63/243) of the samples were considered false-positive and 1.27% false-negative (2/157). It was concluded that the BVDV infection is present in beef cattle herds of the state of Para. Based on the speed of execution, ease of handling, and high Se of the iELISA, it is suggested that this assay can be used as a screening test for the detection of anti-BVDV Ab with the aim of eliminating infected animals from large herds of beef cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25233/21806,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Clinical evaluation and reproductive indices of dairy cows naturally infected with Trypanosoma vivax,"The present study was aimed to assess the clinical changes and reproductive indices of dairy cows naturally infected with Trypanosoma vivax in a herd located in the Central Sertão of Ceará, Brazil. For the study, 40 animals were selected from a herd consisting of 210 dairy cows, and subdivided into two groups: group I, consisting of 20 cows naturally infected with T. vivax, and group II, consisting of 20 uninfected cows. Data on the parameters of reproductive efficiency were evaluated using a farm database (Propad Profissional GP®), in which the individual reproductive characteristics of the animals were stored. Data collected both before and after the outbreak were compared. The cows from group I showed a sudden drop in milk production, mucosal pallor, depression, anorexia, and a significant increase in rectal temperature and decreased hematocrit during the parasitemia outbreak. These clinical signs of the disease disappeared over time. However, T. vivax was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in animals with a negative parasitological test one year after the occurrence. Comparison of the reproductive index data for cows from groups I and II before and after the outbreak showed significant differences in first postpartum estrus, service period, and intervals between deliveries. In addition, repetition of estrus and abortion were significantly associated with T. vivax infection. Analysis of the reproductive indices of cows in groups I and II suggests that T. vivax infection decreased the reproductive efficiency of the study cows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24578/21804,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Ultrasonic pulse technique for evaluation of mechanical damage in processed coffee beans,"The knowledge of the physical characteristics of the coffee bean allows the transition from the conventional storage model in bags to the silo storage, and as an indirect measure of the improvement and conservation of the quality of the stored grain. The elastic modulus allows comparisons on the strength of material. The variations of this occur due to its chemical composition, microstructures and material defects, being able to be used as indicator of the physical integrity of the grain. The ultrasonic pulse technique is an alternative to obtain the elastic modulus in a simple and non-destructive way. In this context, it was proposed the development of a non-destructive methodology that will perform the quality evaluation by determining the elastic modulus of the coffee beans. For this purpose, a reference silo was constructed, reproducing the storage conditions, and the elastic modulus values were determined. The values obtained by the Stress Wave Timer apparatus are between 2.54 and 4.23 MPa, with a maximum load of 8.32 kN, and a calculated vertical pressure of 1,526 kPa. To evaluate the impact of the storage conditions and the loads applied during the non-destructive test, laboratory tests applied in seeds were performed, and the tetrazolium test was the only one able to differentiate the samples. It was concluded that Stress Wave Timer was able to determine the elastic modulus values for the coffee bean mass and could be used as an indicative of the quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26990/21868,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Seed treatment for management of Meloidogyne javanica in soybean,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the active ingredient abamectin, either in isolation or in combination with fungicides and insecticides formulated for the industrial seed treatment, on the population of Meloidogyne javanica, tested under greenhouse and in vitro conditions. In both tests, the combination of the following treatments was assessed: abamectin; thiamethoxam; fludioxonil + metalaxyl-M + thiabendazole. Water was used as control for the in vitro assay, whereas under greenhouse conditions, controls were inoculated and not inoculated with M. javanica. The tests were conducted in a completely randomized design with six (in vitro) and ten (greenhouse) replicates. For in vitro studies the effect on hatching, motility, and mortality of juveniles of M. javanica was evaluated. Under greenhouse conditions, the soybean ‘BRS 133’ seeds were treated, and at 15, 30, and 60 days after inoculation (DAI) with M. javanica, plant measurements were recorded. The penetration of second stage juveniles (J2) was also evaluated at 15 DAI. At 30 DAI, galls, egg masses, nematodes/g of root, and final population were evaluated. At 60 DAI, the final population of nematodes in the roots was quantified. The treatments containing abamectin were the most effective in diminishing the hatching of juveniles. All treatments had an effect on nematode motility when compared to the control, and in the treatment containing only abamectin, total juvenile mortality was observed. In greenhouse conditions, at 15 DAI, the treated soybean plants had the highest root mass and shoot length, differing statistically from the inoculated control. All treatments reduced the number of nematodes per gram of root, differing from the control. At 30 DAI, treatment efficiency was observed in reducing the final population of M. javanica, particularly the treatments using abamectin, and abamectin + thiamethoxam + fludioxonil + metalaxyl-M + thiabendazole. However, at 60 DAI, the effect of the treatments on the population of M. javanica did not persist.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29102/21800,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Drying of macaw palm fruits and its influence on oil quality,"After harvest, macaw palm fruits show high deterioration rates when improperly preserved. A possible cause is the high fruit water content favoring enzymatic and microbiological degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of drying on the mesocarp oil quality during storage and to set the drying curve of macaw palm fruits. For that, two experiments were carried out. In the first, the drying curve of macaw palm fruits was determined at 60 °C, and mathematical models were defined for the process. Drying was performed with freshly harvested fruits (S0) and with fruits stored for 20 days after harvest (S20). Fruits were stored for 20 days after harvested and then went through drying. The fruits were dried in a prototype dryer at 60 °C. After drying, the fruits were stored for different periods (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 days) and evaluated for oil physicochemical parameters. When compared to S0, drying of macaw palm fruits in the S20 treatment showed a lower drying time until equilibrium moisture was reached. In general, all the mathematical models tested were adequate to describe the drying process. Fruits dried at 60 °C controlled mesocarp oil acidification for up to 90 days in storage. On the other hand, drying impaired the mesocarp oil oxidative stability. We may conclude that the drying process is efficient to maintain acidity during the storage of macaw palm fruits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27410/21802,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Inbreeding depression in maize populations and its effects on the obtention of promising inbred lines,"Inbreeding can potentially be used for the development of inbred lines containing alleles of interest, but the genetic causes that control inbreeding depression are not completely known, and there are few studies found in the literature. The present study aimed to obtain estimates of inbreeding depression for eight traits in seven tropical maize populations, analyze the effects of inbreeding over generations and environments, and predict the behavior of inbred lines in future generation S? through linear regression methods. It was found that regardless of the base population used, prediction values could vary when the model was based on only 2 generations of inbreeding due to the environmental component. The influence of the environment in this type of study could be reduced when considering 3 generations of inbreeding, allowing greater precision in predicting the phenotypes of inbred lines. The use of linear regression was effective for inbred line prediction for the different agronomic traits evaluated. The use of 3 levels of inbreeding minimizes the effects of the environmental component in inbred line prediction for grain yield. GO-S was the most promising population for inbred line extraction.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28464/21799,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Oxisol physical quality with application of landfill leachate,"The organic carbon present in the landfill leachate (LL) can improve the physical quality of the soil when applied in agricultural areas, minimizing the problem of disposal of this waste. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the application of different doses of LL on the physical quality of the Red Latosol (Oxisol) after five years of applications. The treatment consisted of applications of LL in doses of 32, 65, 98 and 130 m3 ha-1 crop-1 and the treatment that receives mineral fertilizer. The physical quality of the soil was evaluated in soil samples collected in the layers 0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m, through the analysis of stability and diameter of the aggregates, soil density, total aeration capacity, field capacity and available water content. After five years of application of LL, at doses of 65, 98 and 130 m3 ha-1 crop-1 have promoted a linear increase of the aggregates with diameter greater than 2.00 mm, of the weighted average and geometric diameters and of the soil density, with a consequent reduction of the ratio between macro and micropores and the aeration capacity of the layers 0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m. After five years of these applications, the soils that received the dose of 32 m3 ha-1 crop-1 presented the best physical quality in relation to the other doses, since this dose did not promote an increase of the aggregates larger than 2 mm in the superficial layer (0.00-0.10 m) and was the dose with lower effect in the reduction of aeration of the soil, in relation to the others (65, 98 and 130 m3 ha-1 season-1) in the layers 0.00-0, 10 and 0.10 - 0.20 m.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27865/21865,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Development and production of sugarcane under different levels straw after four years of cultivation,"Environmental constraints, labour shortages and the search for greater efficiency have induced the mechanisation of sugarcane harvesting, providing a large amount of straw in the system, which provides benefits to the soil, the crop and the environment. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the removal of different amounts of straw from the soil surface on the development and productivity of sugarcane in eutrophic Red Latosol. The experiment was conducted in an area belonging to the Usina in Bandeirantes, PR, using a randomised block design with four replications. The effects of six treatments (0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of straw and sugarcane) were evaluated after four years of cultivation on the LAI (leaf area index), tillering, diameter, length and fresh mass of the stalks, in five periods: 60, 120, 180, 240 and 370 days after harvest (DAC). The results were submitted to analysis of variance and the means compared by Tukey’s test. The straw on the soil surface provided benefits to the development and productivity of sugarcane. The management of sugarcane burning, total removal of the straw (0% of soil cover) or 75% of straw resulted in a lower IAF and stalk diameter and a 37% decrease in final yield under conditions of water deficiency. The maintenance of 50% of straw is sufficient to favour the development and to provide greater productivity of the sugarcane, as it is possible to use the 50% surplus of the field for the production of ethanol of second generation or electric energy, without damage to the productivity of the culture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27823/21797,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Quality of ‘Isabel’ grape treated pre-harvest with CaCl2 and citrus biomass-based elicitor,"The high rate of fruit decay and berry drop reduces quality and increases postharvest losses in 'Isabel' grapes, requiring pre-harvest and postharvest management practices available to the small-scale farmer, which maintain quality and extend postharvest life of the clusters. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the pre-harvest application of CaCl2 and Citrus Biomass-based elicitor in 'Isabel' grapes, in the maintenance of quality during storage at room conditions under ambient and modified atmospheres. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with 8 replicates, in the field located at the municipality of São Vicente Férrer-PE, Brazil. 'Isabel' vines were treated 28 days before harvest with: Citrus Biomass-based elicitor (CB), Citrus Biomass-based elicitor + CaCl2 (CB + C), CaCl2 (C) and Control (T) - without application. Grapes harvested in the commercial maturity were stored in a 4 × 2 × 7 factorial arrangement, with 4 treatments (applied in the field), 2 storage conditions, ambient (AA) and modified (AM) atmospheres, under room conditions (25 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 2% RH) and 7 evaluation periods in four replicates. The application of CaCl2 and CB-based elicitor reduced the berry drop index (55 and 75%, respectively), the decay and weight loss of 'Isabel' grape clusters. These treatments, associated or not, increased MA efficiency in maintaining cluster quality. The 'Isabel' grape berry drop index was directly influenced by the SS/TA ratio, pH and fruit decay index.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27812/21864,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Growth models for morphological traits of sunn hemp,"The objective of the present study was to fit Gompertz and Logistic nonlinear to descriptions of morphological traits of sunn hemp. Two uniformity trials were conducted and the crops received identical treatment in all experimental area. Sunn hemp seeds were sown in rows 0.5 m apart with a plant density of 20 plants per row meter in a usable area of 52 m × 50 m. The following morphological traits were evaluated: plant height (PH), number of leaves (NL), stem diameter (SD), and root length (RL). These traits were assessed daily during two sowing periods—seeds were sown on October 22, 2014 (first period) and December 3, 2014 (second period). Four plants were randomly collected daily, beginning 7 days after first period and 13 days after for second period, totaling 94 and 76 evaluation days, respectively. For Gompertz models the equation was used y=a*e^((?-e?^((b-c*xi))and Logistic models the equation was used yi= a/(1+e^((-b-c*xi)). The inflection points of the Gompertz and Logistic models were calculated and the goodness of fit was quantified using the adjusted coefficient of determination, Akaike information criterion, standard deviation of residuals, mean absolute deviation, mean absolute percentage error, and mean prediction error. Differences were observed between the Gompertz and Logistic models and between the experimental periods in the parameter estimate for all morphological traits measured. Satisfactory growth curve fittings were achieved for plant height, number of leaves, and stem diameter in both models using the evaluation criteria: coefficient of determination (R²), Akaike information criterion (AIC), standard deviation of residuals (SDR), mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean prediction error (MPE).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27740/21795,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Carbon fractions and soil fertility affected by tillage and sugarcane residue management an Xanthic Udult,"The gradual change in management practices in sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) production from burning straw to a green harvesting system, as well as the use of minimum soil tillage during field renovation, may affect soil fertility and soil organic matter (SOM) contents. The objectives of this work were to investigate the influence of sugar cane production systems on: (1) soil fertility parameters; (2) on physical carbon fractions; (3) and on humic substance fractions, in a long-term experiment, comparing two soil tillage and two residue management systems an Xanthic Udult, in the coastal tableland region of Espírito Santo State, Brazil. The treatments consisted of plots (conventional tillage (CT) or minimum tillage (MT)) and subplots (residue burned or unburned at harvesting), with five replicates The highest values of Ca2+ + Mg2+ and total organic carbon (TOC) were observed in the MT system in all soil layers, while high values of K+ were observed in the 0.1-0.2 m layer. The CT associated with the burned residue management negatively influenced the TOC values, especially in the 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m layers. The carbon in the humin fraction and organic matter associated with minerals were significantly different among the tillage systems; the MT showed higher values than the CT. However, there were no significant differences between the sugarcane residue management treatments. Overall, fractioning the SOM allowed for a better understanding of tillage and residue management systems effects on the soil properties.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27502/21863,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Performance and stability of maize topcross hybrids from partly inbred lines,"Commercial hybrids are viable to generate base populations for obtaining new superior lines. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the performance and stability of maize topcross hybrids and select superior partly inbred lines. We evaluated 155 topcross hybrids of partly inbred lines crossed with an elite inbred line (tester) together with 14 commercial hybrids (2B688, AG7088, AS1575, DKB390, GNZ2005, GNZ8132, GNZ9501, GNZ9505, GNZ9548, GNZ9623, P30F35, P30F53, P30R50, and Penta) in Guarapuava-PR, Candói-PR, Guarda-Mor-MG, and Paracatu-MG (Brazil). The assessed variable was grain yield (GY), in kg ha-1, at 13% moisture, being the plant stand corrected by covariance method. A variance analysis was carried out, testing both stability and adaptability. There were significant differences for all sources of variation. By considering the GY means of the genotypes in each environment, Candói (10,985 kg ha-1) and Paracatu (10,917 kg ha-1) were in the first group, while Guarda-Mor (10,448 kg ha-1) was allocated in the intermediate group, and Guarapuava (10,159 kg ha-1) formed the group of lower GY means. None of the topcrosses stood out in any of the four environments, which may be related to the differences in climate and altitude between environments. Despite of this fact, lines 9, 13, 39, 40, 60, 93, 108, 179, 184, 189, 194, 211, 212, 213, 216, 217, 235, 243, 245, and 253 excelled as promising and should follow the process of inbreeding, in addition to the topcrosses 87, 144, 179, and 211, which also stood out for stability and adaptability in these environments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26830/21862,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Phosphorus adsorption in soils under forest and savanna from Northern Amazon, Brazil","Studies on maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity (MPAC) in soils from Roraima State and attributes that interfere with the magnitude of this characteristic are relevant and motivated this study. In this context, topsoil samples (0–0.20 m) from four soil classes (Oxisol–LA and Oxisol–LV [ITÃ, Caracaraí]; Oxisol–LA [Serra da Prata, Mucajaí]; Oxisol–LA and Ultisol–PA [CCA, Boa Vista]; Oxisol–FT [Bonfim] and Alfisol –SN [Surumu, Pacaraima]) representative of Roraima State were used in this study in order to determine the influence of soil physical, chemical, and mineralogical attributes on MPAC. Air-dried soil samples of 2.5 g and 0.01 mol L?1 CaCl2 (25 mL) solution were stirred for 24 h, being added P in the form of KH2PO4 at concentrations of 0–60, 0–80, and 0–110 mg L?1. P was analyzed in the supernatant for determining its adsorbed amount (P-rem). Adsorption values were fitted to the Langmuir isotherm in order to assess MPAC. Correlation tests were performed between MPAC and binding energy, pH, organic matter, clay, and CEC. MPAC values ranged from 14.50 to 527.93 mg kg?1 in the soil. The soils FT–Bonfim and LV–ITÃ presented a higher MPAC. Considering the representative soil classes in the State, MPAC does not correlate with any of the assessed attributes. In the soil classes Oxisol and Ultisol, MPAC has a negative and significant correlation with binding energy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27254/21793,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Earthworms (Amynthas spp.) increase common bean growth, microbial biomass, and soil respiration","Few studies have evaluated the effect of earthworms on plants and biological soil attributes, especially among legumes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of earthworms (Amynthas spp.) on growth in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and on soil biological attributes. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with five treatments and eight repetitions. The treatments consisted of inoculation with five different quantities of earthworms of the genus Amynthas (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 worms per pot). Each experimental unit consisted of a plastic pot containing 4 kg of soil and two common bean plants. The experiment was harvested 38 days after seedling emergence. Dry matter and plant height, soil respiration, microbial respiration, microbial biomass, and metabolic quotient were determined. Earthworm recovery in our study was high in number and mass, with all values above 91.6% and 89.1%, respectively. In addition, earthworm fresh biomass decreased only in the treatment that included eight earthworms per pot. The presence of earthworms increased the plant growth and improved soil biological properties, suggesting that agricultural practices that favor the presence of these organisms can be used to increase the production of common bean, and the increased soil CO2 emission caused by the earthworms can be partially offset by the addition of common bean crop residues to the soil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26725/21850,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Zappi (Cactaceae) at different temperatures,"Several species of endemic Cactaceae are found in northeastern Brazil, which are important plants to the local fauna and flora; nevertheless, there are only a few studies assessing the germination of this plant genus. Understanding the germination of species native to the Caatinga is essential to subsidize conservation actions for such ecosystem. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of three localities and different temperatures on the vigor and germination of facheiro seeds. The experiment was conducted by evaluating seed vigor and germination in three distinct areas (Arara, Bananeiras, and Boa Vista) at different temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 20-30 ºC). Quantitative data were submitted to polynomial regression analysis at 5% significance with four replicates of 50 seeds. In Arara, germination rates at 20 and 25 ºC reached 96% and, at 30 ºC, 86%. The temperatures of 25 and 30 ºC presented the best germination speed index. For the three studied areas, the highest germination rates were recorded at a constant temperature of 25 ºC and at the alternating temperature (20-30 ºC). Yet the highest germination speed was reached at 30 ºC. Based on its sexual propagation, the taxon in question is able to survive in environments with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 ºC, as seen in the studied habitats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26557/21789,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies against Bovine herpesvirus type 1 selected by Phage Display Technology,"The specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to desired targets makes these molecules suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic uses against a wide range of pathogens. Phage display antibody libraries offer one method by which mAbs can be selected for, without the use of conventional hybridoma technology. In this work, phage display technology was used to construct, select and characterize a combinatorial single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody library against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) from the immune repertoire of chickens immunized with the virus. In silico analysis of the hypervariable domains of the antibody heavy chains revealed a high frequency of scFv fragments with low variability, suggesting that selection had probably been carried out and favored by a few im-munogenic viral antigens. The reactivity of the scFv fragments selected against BoHV-1 was demon-strated by Phage-ELISA. A significant increase in antibody reactivity to the target was observed after six rounds of library selection, showing its potential use as a molecule for BoHV-1 diagnosis. The strategy described here opens up a field for the use of phage display as a tool for selection of mono-clonal antibodies that could be used for theranostic applications against infectious and parasitic dis-eases of veterinary interest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28876/22294,E-ISSN 1679-0359

38,2017,Clay dispersion and loss in Oxisol treated with different concentrations of limestone,"The addition of limestone to the soil may cause clay dispersion and loss. In this study, we aimed to estimate clay dispersion and loss in Oxisol incubated with different concentrations of limestone. To this end, soil samples were collected from a depth of 0.0-0.20 m, treated with limestone at a concentration of 1.46 Mg ha-1 or 2.73 Mg ha-1 to raise base saturation to 60% and 70%, respectively, and incubated for 12 months under greenhouse conditions. Clay dispersion analysis was conducted monthly using the test tube method. The results showed that clay dispersion increased with soil pH and time after limestone application. However, no significant change in clay concentration was identified in the control (no limestone application). At 60% base saturation, clay loss was first observed to be significantly higher than that of the control at 4 months after application and reached a maximum at 9 months after application. At 70% base saturation, clay loss was also first observed to be significantly higher than that of the control at 4 months after application and reached a maximum at 6 months after application. Overall, our data revealed that clay dispersion due to limestone application was approximately 16 g kg-1 over a period of 12 months and increased with the increasing concentrations of Ca and Mg.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28643/22319,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Harvest season and seed physiological potential of ‘dedo-de-moça BRS Mari’ hot peppers,"The cultivation of chili peppers (Capsicum spp.) plays a key role in the fresh vegetable, condiment, and preserve markets. The determination of the harvest season suitable for seed production is crucial to obtain high-quality seeds and ensure production success. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the harvest season of ‘dedo-de-moça BRS Mari’ hot peppers that provides the maximum seed physiological potential. The flowers in anthesis were labeled daily and the fruits were harvested 25, 40, 55, 70, 85, and 100 days after anthesis (DAA) and classified as green, yellowish green, orange, red, extreme red, and intense red, respectively. The seed physiological potential was determined by using the water content, dry matter, germination, first germination count, germination rate index, and accelerated aging tests. The seed dry matter increased steadily until 55 DAA (3.95 mg per seed), then increased slightly to 70 DAA (4.05 mg per seed), and stabilized from 85 to 100 DAA. The harvested seeds began to germinate at 55 DAA with approximately 40% germination, which peaked at 70 DAA with 87% germination; this value was maintained until 100 DAA. The highest values of the germination rate index were found at 70, 85, and 100 DAA. An increase in seed vigor was observed, based on the accelerated aging test, which peaked at 85 DAA and subsequently decreased. The peppers were harvested between 70 and 85 DAA and red to extreme red were found to be the most recommended colors to obtain ‘dedo-de-moça BRS Mari’ hot pepper seeds with high physiological potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25187/22292,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of diets with different levels of guanidinoacetic acid on newly weaned piglets,"Ninety barrow piglets weaned at 21 days old were used to evaluate the effects of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) supplementation on their performance and blood creatinine and creatine kinase (CK) levels during the nursery phase (21 to 63 days old). The piglets were distributed in a randomized block design with five treatments (0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20% GAA inclusion), six repetitions, and three animals per repetition. The experimental rations were formulated to meet the nutritional requirements for the phases of 21 to 32, 33 to 42 and 43 to 63 days of age. The experimental diets and water were offered ad libitum throughout the experimental period. At 42 and 63 days old, blood was collected from one animal in each experimental unit for creatinine and creatine kinase analysis. The analysed variables were daily weight gain (DFG), daily feed intake (DFI), and feed conversion (FC) in the 21 to 42 days old and 21 to 63 days old of the nursery phase. All variables were subjected to analysis of variance and regression analysis. We adopted ? = 0.05, and considered a trend to be present when ? was between 0.05 and 0.10. In the pre-initial period (21 to 42 days old), there was an increasing trend in daily weight (P = 0.069), which increased to the level of 0.97% of GAA inclusion. The DFI and FC were not significantly affected by the addition of different GAA levels in the diet. Creatinine levels in the blood at 42 and 63 days old were not significantly influenced by the treatments. The level of CK at 42 days old showed an increasing trend (P = 0.077) that occurred quadratically to the level of 0.085% of GAA inclusion, with no significant difference for this variable at 63 days old. The use of GAA did not promote improvements in performance or blood creatinine and CK levels in piglets in the nursery phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30122/22291,E-ISSN 1679-0359

(Siluriformes, Heptapteridae)","Agroecology-based aquaculture emerges as a particularly interesting production alternative for rural family farmers. In such systems, it is desirable to use means for enhancing the zootechnical performance and improving fish immune responses from natural products. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of organic diet supplementation with oregano essential oil, Origanum vulgare, on zootechnical performance, hematological parameters, and resistance to the ectoparasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (ich) in silver catfish juveniles, Rhamdia sp. A completely randomized design with five treatments (concentrations 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g oregano essential oil kg-1 diet) and four replicates was adopted. Groups of 20 silver catfish juveniles (initial weight 12.5 ± 0.5g) were stocked in 20 polyethylene tanks (54 L usable volume) connected to a water recirculation system with individual aeration. The diets were prepared with certified organic ingredients and offered for 89 days in two meals a day. At the end of the experimental period, survival, zootechnical performance, hematological parameters, and fish body composition were evaluated. After the final biometry, an experimental challenge with ich infection was performed. Dietary concentrations of oregano essential oil had no effects on growth, hematology, and body composition of silver catfish juveniles (p > 0.05). Neither was there any influence on the level of infection and accumulated mortality of the fish under challenge with ich. Supplementation with oregano essential oil did not prove to be an effective dietary additive in improving the performance or increasing resistance against ich in silver catfish juveniles. However, in view of the importance of the topic, further studies should be carried out to increase knowledge about the effect of this and other natural additives in silver catfish, including at other stages of development.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29664/22290,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Animal performance, production, and quality of Tanzania grass fertilized with nitrogen","This study aimed to assess forage production, animal performance, and the chemical composition of Tanzania grass pasture fertilized with 50, 100, 200, and 400 kg ha-1 of nitrogen. The variables analyzed were: leaf mass, daily accumulation rate, leaf/stem ratio, average daily gain, stocking rate, live weight gain per unit of area crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and in vitro dry matter digestibility of leaves. The pasture management maintained the pasture height at 50 cm by using a continuous grazing method with the adjustment of stocking rate. The experimental design was a randomized block with three replicates. The leaf mass increased linearly in response to nitrogen, with an increase of 1003 kg (34%) observed between a nitrogen content of 50 and 400 kg ha-1. Nitrogen did not affect the average daily gain, but increased the stocking rate and live weight gain ha-1. The value of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber were higher with increased nitrogen levels, whereas the leaf digestibility did not affect nitrogen use. The comparison of 50 and 400 kg ha-1 levels indicated that there was an average increase of 19.2% in the leaf crude protein. The increased application of nitrogen fertilizer in Tanzania grass improved the chemical composition and animal performance; with regard to studied variables, the dose of 200 kg ha-1 resulted in the greatest improvement.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29633/22289,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Standardized ileal digestible lysine in diets for pigs fed ractopamine in commercial production system,"Two consecutive experiments were conducted using 480 pigs each with six replicate pens per treatment and 10 pigs per pen to evaluate the effect of standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys (0.81, 0.91, 1.01, and 1.11%) in diets containing ractopamine (RAC; 10 or 20 mg kg-1) on growth and carcass traits of barrows in a commercial production system. There were no effects of either RAC levels or the interaction between RAC and SID Lys levels on any of the performance and carcass variables. No lack of fit was detected in the response surface analysis. From d 0 to 21, there was no effect of SID Lys levels on ADFI. However, as SID Lys increased, there was a linear increase in ADG and G:F. As SID Lys increased, the ADG, G:F, loin depth, and lean percentage improved linearly from d 0 to 28, with no effect on ADFI and backfat thickness. In conclusion, performance and carcass traits of pigs fed RAC (10 or 20 mg kg-1) in a commercial finishing facility are improved by up to 1.11% SID Lys supplementation. There is no additional benefit of feeding 20 mg kg-1 RAC in comparison with 10 mg kg-1 RAC.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29347/22287,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Chromium and selenium-enriched yeast for castrated finishing pigs: effects on performance and carcass characteristics,"To evaluate the effect of organic chromium (Cr) and selenium (Se) supplementation on performance and carcass characteristics of finishing pigs, 300 castrated males were distributed in a randomized block design with three treatments and five replications of 20 pigs each. Treatments consisted of different diets, formulated to reach or exceed Rostagno et al. (2011) nutritional requirements, as follows: 1) control - basal diet without organic Cr and Se supplementation from 70 to 130 kg of body weight; 2) CrSe70 - basal diet supplemented with 0.8 mg kg-1 of Cr- and 0.6 mg kg-1 of Se-enriched yeast from 70 to 130 kg of body weight; 3) CrSe100 - basal diet without organic Cr and Se supplementation from 70 to 100 kg of body weight followed by basal diet supplemented with 0.8 mg kg-1 of Cr- and 0.6 mg kg-1 of Se-enriched yeast from 100 to 130 kg of body weight. Performance was evaluated by measuring body weight, daily weight gain, daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio. At the end of experimental period, pigs were sacrificed and lean meat percentage, longissimus dorsi muscle depth, back fat thickness, and carcass bonus index were determined using prediction equations generated by the software Hennessy System GP4 after carcass scanning with an electronic probe. Data were submitted to one-way ANOVA and in case of significant differences (P ? 0.05), means were compared by SNK multiple-range test. Daily feed intake (P = 0.008) and feed conversion ratio (P = 0.004) decreased for pigs supplemented with Cr- and Se-enriched yeast from 70 to 100 kg of body weight. Otherwise, pigs supplemented between 100 and 130 kg of body weight increased (P = 0.032) daily feed intake in comparison to the control group. Regarding carcass characteristics, Cr- and Se-enriched yeast supplementation increased (P = 0.019) longissimus dorsi muscle depth in both CrSe70 and CrSe100 treatments. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of Cr- and Se-enriched yeast for castrated male pigs between 70 and 130 kg of body weight increases longissimus dorsi muscle depth in carcass without affecting final body weight or daily weight gain of the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29598/22288,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A total of 50 pigs, with initial weight of 11.14±0.24 kg; were distributed in a randomized blocks design with five treatments (1.10; 1.25; 1.40; 1.55 and 1.70% SID leucine), five replicates and two animals per experimental unit, comprised for a barrow and a gilt. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) reduced (P=0.018) due to the increasing SID leucine levels, without affecting other growth performance parameters (final weight, average daily feed intake, average daily gain, backfat thickness, longissimus dorsi depth and lean meat percentage). There was a quadratic effect for plasma triglyceride (P=0.049) and plasma urea (P=0.001). The optimal SID leucine levels obtained for triglycerides and urea were 1.16% and 1.24%, respectively, by associating the quadratic model with the Linear Response Plateu. Low crude protein diets with SID leucine levels up to 1.70% improved the feed conversion with desired urea and triglycerides concentration in blood plasmas achieved at 1.16% and 1.24%, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29157/22345,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Agronomic characteristics and nutritive value of elephant grass clones managed under rotational stocking during the dry period,"This study aimed to evaluate the agronomic characteristics and nutritional value of two clones of elephant grass (CNPGL 00-1-3 and BRS Kurumi) operating under rotational stocking in the dry season. A completely randomized design with repeated measures (grazing cycles) and three replicates (paddocks) was used. Clones were managed under rotational stocking with a defoliation interval of 24 days and four days of occupation of paddocks, using Holstein x Gyr heifers with mean body weight of 150 kg. The evaluations were conducted in April/May, May/June, June/July and July/August 2010. Green forage mass was influenced by clone and grazing cycle, with higher mean value observed for CNPGL 03-01-00, which was 17% higher than the value observed for BRS Kurumi, and there was decreased of dry mass of green forage with the advance of grazing cycles. Leaf mass was influenced only by grazing cycle, with gradual reduction from the first to the third cycle. However, in fourth cycle was increase in biomass of leaves, which did not differ from that observed in the second cycle. There was interaction for dry matter production of stem, being observed differences in the first and third cycles for the clones. There was no effect of the factors studied for the production of senescent material. The leaf:stem ratio was influenced by grazing cycles, with interaction of the factors studied. The clone BRS Kurumi kept the leaf:stem ratio stable over the cycles, while clone CNPGL 1-3-00 presented a decrease in leaf:stem ratio from first until to third cycle. The content of crude protein (PB) was not influenced by the factors studied, with average values of 15.3% and 15.8% PB for the CNPGL 00-1-3 and BRS Kurumi clones. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and the in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were affected only by grazing cycles. The highest values of NDF were observed in the three first grazing cycles, with values of 55.5%, 56.0% and 55.7% from the first to the third grazing cycle, respectively, while in the fourth cycle was obtained the value of 50.5%. There was a decrease in the IVDMD until the third cycle. In the fourth cycle the IVDMD values were similar to the first cycle. The clones did not differ in relation to biomass production, morphological composition and nutritional value, during the dry season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28850/22285,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Distiller’s dried grains with solubles (Zea mays L.) in feeding sheep on nitrogen balance,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of diets supplemented with 0.0, 8.0, 16.0, and 24.0% distiller’s dried grain solubles (DDGS) on nitrogen (N) intake, fecal and urinary N excretion, and N absorption and retention (N balance, NB) by feeding sheep. Four sheep of unidentified race were used, with an average body weight of 23.5 ± 1.5 kg, and housed in metabolism cages. We used a 4 × 4 Latin square design for the experimental design, and each experimental period lasted for 20 days. Data on N intake (NI), fecal N, urinary N, absorbed N, and NB were expressed in g day-1; percentage of NI and grams per kilogram of metabolic weight g (kg0.75)-1 were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis at 5% probability. Inclusion of the different concentrations of DDGS in sheep diets had no effect on NI (mean of 15.11 g animal-1 day-1), nor on fecal and urinary N excretion (mean of 5.16 and 0.16 g animal-1 day-1, respectively). Moreover, DDGS supplementation did not alter NB or N absorption (mean of 9.79 and 9.95 g animal-1 day-1, respectively). Thus, it can be concluded that inclusion of up to 24% of DDGS in feed does not affect NI, fecal and urinary N excretion, and NB in sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28804/22284,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Validation of body condition score system in Holstein x Zebu cows via ultrasound method during the transition period and early lactation,"This study aims to validate, by means of subcutaneous rump fat thickness (RFT), the suitability of the visual evaluation of body condition score (BCS) to indicate the body condition of crossbred dairy cows (Holstein x Zebu) during the transition period and early lactation. Animals were selected according to lactation period and distributed into three groups: PP (0 to 4 weeks antepartum; n = 30), L4 (0 to 4 weeks postpartum; n = 15), and L + 5 (5 to 14 weeks postpartum; n = 63). The relationship among RFT, BCS, and body weight (BW) was investigated using correlation and regression analyses. The variables BCS, RFT, and BW were different among the three groups (P < 0.05). The correlations between BCS and RFT were higher in groups PP and L + 5 (r = 0.78 and r = 0.71 respectively). However, the L4 group showed a weak correlation (r = -0.04). The regression models were able to explain how much RFT varies because of changes in BCS, with coefficients of determination equal to 0.61 for PP and 0.51 for L + 5 group. In conclusion, BCS can be considered a good predictor of RFT for crossbred Holstein x Zebu cows in antepartum and postpartum for over 5 weeks of lactation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28534/22283,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Forage production from fine branches and sprouts of native maniçoba,"The growth and forage production of Manihot glaziovii were evaluated in plants growing in Itapetim-PE, Brazil via a complete block experimental design with four treatments (0, 33, 50, and 100% branch cutting intensity) to analyze increases in height and diameter. Furthermore, 3×2 factorial treatments (three branch cutting intensities: 33, 50, and 100% as well as two types of collected forage material: Branches with diameter < 10 mm and corresponding sprouts on the same branches 1 year after being cut) were analyzed for improvement in forage quantity and quality parameters. Height increase was affected (P < 0.05) by branch cutting intensity (0.29, 0.11, 0.43, and -0.04 m plant-1, respectively, for 0, 33, 50, and 100% branch cutting intensities), while the increase in diameter was not affected (P > 0.05) (3.97 mm plant-1 was the overall mean increase). Cutting intensity×type of collected material, in combination, affected (P < 0.05) the quantity of the collected forage: means were considered similar (P > 0.05) in the first (branches) and second (sprouts) forage collection events for 33% (0.66 and 0.75 kg dry matter plant-1, respectively) and 50% (1.40 and 1.73 kg dry matter plant-1, respectively) cutting intensities; it decreased (P < 0.05) from the first to the second collection events, when 100% of branches and sprouts were harvested (3.37 and 2.06 kg dry matter plant-1, respectively). The combined effects of aforementioned parameters were observed (P < 0.05) as interactions for some forage quality variables. Neutral detergent fiber content remained constant (P > 0.05) between 50.57 and 54.41% in forage containing branch and sprouts from 33 and 50% cutting intensities. It increased (P < 0.05) to 62.20% in sprouts from 100% cutting intensity. Acid detergent fiber content increased (P < 0.05) from around 38.4% to 46.63% in sprouts from plants subjected to 100% cutting intensity. The crude protein (between 8.72 and 10.08%) and ether extract (between 2.74 and 4.35%) contents were unaffected (P > 0.05) by these factors. Mineral matter content was higher (P < 0.05) in sprouts from all cutting intensities with 5.9% being the highest. Up to 50% of Manihot glaziovii branches with Ø < 10 mm and corresponding 1-year-old sprouts can be pruned with no negative effect on the quality and quantity (up to 1.73 kg dry matter plant-1) of the collected forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28456/22281,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Nutrient balance in the soil and nutritive characteristics of maize silage cut at different heights,"Maize harvesting for silage promotes intense use of soil nutrients. The increase in forage harvesting time can ease nutrient use and benefit the nutritional quality of the silage. However, this practice may be economically unviable due to the reduction in the volume of harvested forage. The objective of our experiment was to evaluate several agronomic parameters, such as production, plant composition, nutritional value of silage and nutrient balance in the soil by harvesting the maize plant at different silage heights: 0.20; 0.40; 0.60; 0.80 and 1.00 m above the ground. The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments with five repetitions. Representative plants in each plot were cut and fragmented in a forage machine. This material was homogenized and ensiled in experimental polyvinyl chloride (PVC) silos. Each 0.10 m increase at harvest provided an increase of 0.65% in the dry matter content of the forage and reduced harvest to 339 kg ha-1 of dry matter. The presence of grains in the forage increased linearly 1.24% for every 0.10 m at the time of harvest. The levels of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and silage lignin had a linear decrease of 4.5, 2.8 and 9.6%, respectively, per each 0.10 m lift crop height. Regarding the total digestible nutrients, dry matter intake and the relative forage, these values had a linear increase of 0.5, 7.2 and 8.2%, respectively. For each 0.10 m increase in cutting height, there was a decrease in soil nutrients, namely 3.6 kg ha-1 N, 1.3 kg ha-1 P2O5, 9.5 kg ha-1 K2O, 0.9 kg ha-1 CaO and 1.2 kg ha-1 MgO. Even with the harvest at 1.00 m above the ground, nutrient recycling nutrients by necromass is not sufficient to balance the potassium balance in the soil, causing a decline of 37.69 kg ha-1 K2O. The maize harvest to 0.47 m height represented the best relationship between silage quantity and quality, being the height that presents the greatest potential for economic return, and can fund management practices and soil fertilization to prevent degradation in foraging systems, mainly to overcome the negative balance of potassium in the system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28463/22282,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Age castration of Nellore males on the profile of fatty acids of meat,"This study aimed to evaluate the cholesterol content, ?-tocopherol and fatty acids in the meat of Nellore young bulls or steers castrated at different ages, 13 or 18 months. The animals were confined for 100 days and slaughtered at 22 months of age. The experimental design was completely randomized with three treatments, using 12 repetitions. The levels of palmitic acid (26.39%), stearic (24.39%), myristic (3.01%) and total saturated fatty acids were not altered by sexual condition or castration age. Oleic was the fatty acid with the highest average participation in the meat (34.54%), and lower content in the meat of young bulls in relation to the castrated. The content of total unsaturated fatty acids was lower in the young bulls in relation to castrated at 18 months, which did not differ from castrated at 12 months. The content of total polyunsaturated fatty acids was increased by elevation of the castration age, being similar between young bulls and castrated at 18 months. The ratio ?6/?3 was not altered by sexual condition or castration age. Castration at the beginning of the finishing period increases the content of beneficial fatty acids to health in relation to castrated in the first third of backgrounding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27119/22279,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Contribution of basal and aerial tillers to forage production dynamics in Tifton-85 bermudagrass irrigated with fishpond wastewater and fertilized with NPK,"This paper aims to assess the contribution of basal and aerial tillers to structural and productive characteristics of Tifton 85 bermudagrass, irrigated with fish tank wastewaters and fertilized with NPK. The experiment was conducted in the city of Petrolina-PE, Northeastern Brazil. The evaluated area had 960 m2 subdivided into five treatments and ten replicates, in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of different fertilization rates of NPK (0, 33, 67, 100, and 150%) as recommended by the Handbook of Fertilization Recommendations for the State of Pernambuco, and based on a prior soil analysis. Irrigation water came from fishponds with Nile Tilapia fingerlings. The experiment was divided into four intervals of 27, 29, 18, and 21 days respective to the first, second, third, and fourth cuts. Both tiller types were analyzed for number of individuals, culm length and diameter, fully- and partially-expanded leaves, leaf length and width (fully or partially expanded), dry mass of leaves (fully and partially expanded and total), culm, dead tissue, and total tiller, and the ratio of leaf and culm. Both structural and productive characteristics showed a linear growth trend for both types, with emphasis on the basal tillers. Thus, a suitable supply of nutrients is crucial for grasses, mainly NPK, as these are macronutrients of vital importance in physiological processes. In addition to the nutrients supplied via fish farming wastewater, fertilization with 150% of the recommended amount of NPK promoted a greater structural development of the tillers, increasing their productivity levels.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26775/22278,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Productivity and the presence of mycotoxins in oats, wheat, and triticale subjected to grazing","This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grazing on the agronomic characteristics, grain yield, and presence of the mycotoxins aflatoxins, fumonisins, and zearalenone in IPR 126 oat, BRS Tarumã wheat, and IPR 111 triticale. This study was performed from April 24, 2012 to November 11, 2013 at UNIOESTE’s Experimental Farm in southern Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block in a banded scheme, with four replications. The treatments in the A tracks were the three crops and the B tracks, the treatments: without grazing, one grazing event, or two grazing events. One grazing reduced the productivity of oat by 42.48% and triticale by 28.09% and increased wheat productivity by 24.89%. Two grazings reduced oat productivity by 54.14%, wheat by 40.96%, and triticale by 54.69%. Crops subjected to two grazings should be used for dry matter production for ground cover or partially used for silage when the plant is in the pasty or semi-hard grain stage, as grazing affects the agronomic characteristics and grain yield. The BRS Tarumã wheat, when used in crop-livestock integration systems, should be grazed only once due to increased productivity, while IPR 126 oat and IPR 111 triticale should not be grazed in crop-livestock integration systems for commercial production of grain. Oats from grazed plants should not be added to feeds of poultry in the early stage or pigs in the early and growth stages due to the higher levels of aflatoxins, fumonisins, and zearalenone. Grazing of winter crops increases the length of the crop cycle and grain formation will occur under climatic conditions favorable to the mycotoxins. Therefore, when grains are intended for human consumption, grazing is not recommended, as it increases the possibility of aflatoxins, fumonisins, and zearalenone at levels above the maximum tolerable levels permitted by law. These grains should be supplied to animals only after analysis of the mycotoxin levels present in the grains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27642/22322,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Chemical control of signalgrass in alfalfa crops,"The use of herbicides to control grass in Medicago sativa (alfalfa) pastures is still incipient. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of fluazifop-p-butyl in the control of Brachiaria decumbens (signalgrass) in alfalfa. Thus, randomized block design was used, with seven doses of fluazifop-p-butyl (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 g ha-1), and four replications. Herbicide application was performed when the plants had about 20 cm height. Chlorophyll fluorescence, control of signalgrass and alfalfa toxicity were evaluated at 7, 15 e 30 days after application (DAA) and, at 45 DAA and 45 days after cut (DAC), both species were cut and tiller density, as well as branches and dry matter of forage species, were determined. Fluazifop-p-butyl does not affect the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus of alfalfa plants, due to high tolerance to this mechanism of action presented by dicotyledonous species. However, signalgrass had physiological variables negatively affected by the herbicide, indicating the presence of physiological stress, even at the lowest doses of the product. The dose of 50 g ha-1 of fluazifop-p-butyl is effective in controlling signalgrass, without causing physiological and growth damage in alfalfa plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23498/22315,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Blood testosterone level and growth of castrated, uncastrated, and cryptorchid lambs","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sexual status on blood testosterone levels and its influence on lamb growth. A total of 49 Texel x Corriedale males, originating of single births, were divided into three groups: uncastrated (n = 16), castrated (n = 17) and cryptorchid (n = 16), in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, in extensive natural pasture, with feed supplementation after weaning. The effect of the sexual status was examined by analysis of variance. Uncastrated and castrated lambs showed higher body weight, thoracic perimeter, and body compactness between the 35th and 203th day of age. Uncastrated lambs had mean weight higher than cryptorchid lambs over the whole period. Cryptorchid lambs had an average weight gain greater than castrated lambs between the 203rd and 259th days. Castrated lambs had a higher body condition score on the 147th day than the cryptorchid lambs, and on the 175th and 203rd days than uncastrated and cryptorchid lambs. Blood testosterone concentrations were higher in the uncastrated and cryptorchid lambs on the 203rd and 231st days and in the overall mean. The findings of this study showed that, with advancing age, the sexual status affects the testosterone production, not showing differences regarding growth at young ages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24679/22277,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The system was monitored by analyzing samples collected in the influent and effluent of ABR and UASB. The following parameters were analyzed: temperature, pH, total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Averages of total removal of COD and BOD were 96.7 and 98.4%, respectively. The mean concentrations of COD, BOD, TSS, and VSS at the final effluent were 611, 124, 138, and 134 mg L-1, respectively. The mean volumetric organic loadings (VOL) at the ABR and UASB were 10.29 and 0.99 kg COD m-1d-1. Therefore, the ABR-UASB system was found to be a promising alternative for the swine wastewater treatment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24637/22316,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Quantitative analysis of bone marrow in pancytopenic dogs,"The pancytopenia can be associated with intra and extra medullary disorders. When the etiology is not obvious, the examination of bone marrow is necessary. The study aims to report and discuss quantitative amendments in bone marrow and their causes in dogs with pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate was obtained from 65 dogs with pancytopenia over a period of 13 consecutive months for preparation of smears stained by Giemsa and observed in light microscopy. Five hundred cells differential count was held; and assessed myeloid:erythroid ratio, cellularity, megakaryocytes and direct parasitological examination. The data were evaluated by the Chi-square statistical test. Blood tests of 3120 canines with several clinical changes were analyzed to identify pancytopenia, which accounted for 167 (5.4%) dogs. Interpretation of quantitative characteristics was carried out from the bone marrow smear in 65 pancytopenic dogs and the etiology was established in 40 (61.5%) of these, which included infection by E. canis and L. chagasi, idiopathic aplastic anemia, chronic renal failure and co-infections. In 17 (26.2%) animals were not observed medullary changes. The most bone marrow change was observed myeloid and erythroid hypoplasia in 17 (26.2%) dogs, followed by myeloid and erythroid hyperplasia (24.6%). The myelogram association to the blood cell count allowed the identification of medullary findings and its participation on the occurrence of pancytopenia cases. The number of cases resulting from infectious diseases was 38 (58.5%) in canine assessed: significant number due to its endemic characteristic of the study region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27716/22321,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Sexual behavior of 'morada nova' breeding sheep under semi-intensive rearing during the mating season in the brazilian semiarid,"This study aimed to evaluate the sexual behavior of 'Morada Nova' breeding sheep reared in the Brazilian semi-arid during dry and rainy seasons in a semi-intensive system. The behavioral data were gathered from 4 rams and 114 ewes, among which 55 during the rainy season and the other 59 females in the dry season. The behavioral observations were conducted from 6 am to 5 pm, during both periods. The observations were carried out continuously and split into 'event' (execution frequency) and 'state' (execution time). During the rainy season, the breeding sheep showed the most efficient sexual behavior, with a shorter reaction time (RT) and less frequent mount attempts (MA), being of 122 sec and 2.97, respectively. However, throughout the dry period, some sexual behaviors such as sniffing the urogenital of females (SUF), penis exposure (EXP), head tossing (HT), and courting of females (FC) became more frequent, mainly in the afternoon, as with the flehmen response (FR). Male courting behavior was more evident in the rainy season during the end of the day, remaining less active during the dry period. Sexual behavior intensity in 'Morada Nova' sheep varies throughout the day, especially in the dry season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28717/22272,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Ex vivo and in vivo study of Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer in the measurement of intraocular pressure in cats,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the Kowa HA-2 applanation tonometer in measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in cats. Ten healthy eyes were used in an ex vivo study in which the calibration curve for manometry vs. tonometry was determined by artificially raising the IOP in 5 mmHg increments up to 60 mmHg (10-60 mmHg). Both eyes of 10 anesthetized cats were studiedin vivo to compare manometry vs. tonometry. In the ambulatory study, 78 healthy eyes, 7 eyes with glaucoma and 20 eyes with uveitis were evaluated by tonometry, which was performed with topical anesthesia and 1% fluorescein eye drops for the formation of fluorescein semicircles. The correlation coefficient (r²) between the manometer and the Kowa HA-2 tonometer was 0.993 and the linear regression equation was y = 0.0915x + 0.0878 in the ex-vivo study. In the in vivo study, the IOP values (mean±SD, in mmHg) in manometry were 15.6 ± 1.1(14.0 – 17.5) and in tonometry were 15.5 ± 1.2(13.5 – 17.2), with no significant difference (P > 0.05) between manometry and tonometry. In ambulatory study, using the Kowa HA-2 tonometer, the IOP values (mean±SD, in mmHg) were 15.0 ± 1.5 (11.8 – 18.3) for the healthy eyes, 38.4 ± 8.1(29.6 – 53.7) for glaucomatous eyes and 10.4 ± 2.0(5.3 – 12.2) for eyes with uveitis. There was a strong correlation and accuracy between the IOP values with the manometry and the Kowa HA-2 tonometer. In the ambulatorystudy the IOP values obtained with the tonometer were compatible for animals with healthy eyes and with clinical signs of glaucoma and uveitis. We conclude that the Kowa HA-2 tonometer can be used in the measurement of IOP in cats, since it is a practical and accurate method in this species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28652/22271,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Limestone and phosphorus application and forage production in natural pastures with sodseeding of cool-season species,"Natural pastures are important ecosystems that both contribute to biodiversity conservation and provide an important source of income, especially for cattle ranchers. While these pastures yield fairly low productivity, they can be improved by increasing soil fertility and introducing species with high productive potentials. In this sense, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of applying limestone and phosphorus, as well as introducing cool-season species with a mixture of species dominated by Schizachyrium tenerum Nees, into a natural pasture in the Catarinense Plateau. The experiment was conducted from January 2010 to December 2013; the treatments consisted of superficial distribution of limestone in proportions of 3.6, 7.2, 11.0, and 14.4 t ha-1, as well as distribution of phosphorus in the form of triple superphosphate in proportions of 35, 70, 105, and 140 kg of P2O5 ha-1. In addition, cool-season species were overseeded. The experiment consisted of a randomized block design with subdivided plots and three replications. Limestone was applied to the main parcel, whereas phosphorus was applied to the subplots. There was no interaction between the levels of limestone and phosphorus. The application of 11.0 t ha-1 of limestone yielded the highest forage production, with 3,932.2 kg of dry matter (DM) ha-1 during the second year. Red clover was the species that best reacted to the additions, with levels of 7.2 and 11.0 t ha-1 over the 4 years. In addition, phosphorus provoked a positive response throughout the experiment. The highest forage production was observed during the second year, with an addition of 140 kg P2O5 ha-1 (4,419.4 kg DM ha-1). Only one-eighth of the recommended amount of limestone (3.6 t ha-1) allowed for the establishment and persistence of the legumes introduced into natural pastures. These additions, associated with increasing levels of phosphorus, yielded linear growth in the production of forage in natural pastures with a mixture of species dominated by Schizachyrium tenerum Nees.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23433/22314,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Parasite prevalence among equidae in the backland of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil","The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal and lung parasites in equidae reared in the backland of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil and also evaluate the influence of equidae species, rearing system, age group, and anthelmintic administration schedule the infection level. 185 fecal samples were randomly collected in cities in the backland of Pernambuco. After collection, the material was submitted to a qualitative coproparasitological analyses and number of eggs and larvae of parasites. The horses were found to have lower EPG count than the donkeys. Regarding the rearing system, equidae reared in pasture had higher EPG counts than those confined in pens. Moreover, foals under one year old have lower EPG count than those between one and two years old. No difference was found in EPG count among de equidae that received anthelmintic at different frequencies, while the horses and donkeys had a higher amount of Cyathostominae than of other nematodes researched. It is concluded that, in the backland of Pernambuco, most equidae had light to moderate parasite loads, with a predominance of the Cyathostominae e Strongylinae subfamilies, with no horses, donkeys, or mules infected by Dictyocaulus arnfieldi. In addition, the donkeys had higher parasite loads than the horses and the extensive grazing system presents a greater risk of infections by nematodes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27593/22269,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Comparative evaluation between the extenders TES-TRIS and ACP-112® and the association of Sálva Marajó oil (Lippia origanoides) in the quality of cryopreserved buffalo sperm,"For artificial insemination, it is essential to use frozen semen, however the freezing process causes deleterious changes to the structure and integrity of sperm membranes that compromise the function of sperm. To avoid this cellular damage, extenders and suitable substrates must be used to recover the highest possible number of viable cells post-thaw. To this end, in the first experiment, we evaluated three different extenders: TES-TRIS, which is widely used for buffaloes; and an extender composed of powdered coconut water-based (ACP-112®) with or without milk (ACP-112®-milk) for buffalo semen freezing. In the second experiment, we evaluated the effect of Lippia origanoides oil extract on protecting buffalo sperm against cryoinjury arising from freezing semen. Semen was collected from ten buffalo bulls (10 ejaculates/bull) and diluted in TES-TRIS (control), ACP-112® or ACP-112®-Milk in the first experiment. In the second experiment, the samples were diluted in the diluent with the best results for sperm quality obtained in experiment I, and 2.5 ?g mL-1, 5 ?g mL-1 or 10 ?g mL-1 of the plant extract was added to treatments; and a control group containing only the diluent was also included. The fresh semen was analyzed for conventional features such as motility, concentration, morphology and viability. After thawing, the samples were evaluated again for motility, vigor and supra-vital staining, and then, were performed the of thermal-resistance test, hypoosmotic test and evaluated sperm membrane integrity with the fluorescent probes PI, FITC-PSA and JC-1 using flow cytometry. The data were submitted to ANOVA, and the results were compared by Tukey’s test at a significance of 5%. In the first experiment, the extender TES-TRIS showed better results for the various characteristics evaluated compared to ACP-112® and ACP-112®-Milk (P < 0.05), demonstrating greater protection of the buffalo sperm structures during cryopreservation. In the second experiment, the treatments with different concentrations of Lippia origanoides essential oil extract showed no differences among the assessed variables regarding the protection of sperm structures during cryopreservation (P > 0.05). Based on these data, we demonstrated the beneficial effects of TES-TRIS for post-thaw buffalo sperm quality; however, no protective effect was observed for buffalo sperm cryopreserved with the different tested concentrations of Lippia origanoides extract oil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27364/22268,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Comparative study between the hemocytometric and spectrophotometric methods for measuring the sperm concentration of young Nelore bulls,"Determination of sperm concentration using the Neubauer chamber (hemocytometric method) is a direct method for counting cells and also the most reliable. However, the process is time-consuming rendering it the least practical method when large numbers of ejaculates need to be processed. The spectrophotometer measures sperm concentrations as optical density and its main advantages are practicality and speed. This paper aimed to compare the results between evaluators using the hemocytometric method and the spectrophotometer for measuring sperm concentrations in young Nelore bulls. In total, 73 ejaculations from 20 young Nelore bulls were collected by electroejaculation. After soundness examination, 10 µL of the semen was diluted in 2 mL saline formaldehyde for measuring the sperm concentration per mL by the hemocytometric method (measured by three different evaluators) and the spectrophotometer method at 550 nm wavelength. No differences were detected in the results of sperm concentration measurements per mL among the evaluators using the hemocytometric method and the spectrophotometer (P > 0.05). The intraclass correlation was high (0.9), showing high replicability among the evaluator measurements. These results demonstrate that measurements performed using the spectrophotometer are reliable and can substitute the hemocytometric method in future for performing sperm concentration measurements in young Nelore bulls, thus improving and standardizing the techniques used in andrology laboratories.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27072/22267,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Growth and yield of corn forage intercropped with marandu grass in an agrosilvopastoral system with eucalyptus,"Corn and grass intercropping is an interesting practice, and forage plants belonging to the genus Urochloa are the most commonly used in these situations. These plants show excellent adaptation to low-fertility soil, easy establishment, considerable biomass production, as well as being an important competitor with weeds. In agrosilvopastoral systems, the yield of corn crops grown together with trees is hindered due to the reduced radiation incidence caused by tree shading. This study aimed to evaluate corn growth, light interception, and chlorophyll content when intercropped with marandu grass in an agrosilvopastoral system with one and three eucalyptus rows, and compare them with plants under full sun. The experiment was conducted in Andradina - SP (Brazil). Treatments consisted of intercropping with no eucalyptus (plants under full sun: control), one system with one eucalyptus row and another with three rows. We also assessed the effect of five distances between corn plants and eucalyptus trees (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 m). Between eucalyptus rows, corn plants were intercropped with marandu grass. The analyzed variables were corn plant height, ear height, chlorophyll content index, light interception, dry matter, and fresh and dry forage weights. The experimental design was a randomized block in a factorial scheme plus a control, with four repetitions. Tree arrangements had no influence on corn forage, dry matter, plant height, or ear height. Lower results of yield, dry matter, plant height, and ear height were observed for plants spaced 2 m from trees. In the first two evaluations, significant differences of light interception were found for the different distances. Neither tree arrangements (one and three rows) nor the distances from the trees had any impact on corn heights, with no difference between control and the agrosilvopastoral systems. Neither plant distances from trees nor tree arrangements had an influence on chlorophyll content index of corn plants, with no difference between control and the treatments. As a result, corn growth and forage yield under agroforestry systems are similar in arrangements of 1 and 3 eucalyptus rows (15-month-old trees) and under full sun. However, corn dry matter contents were lower in systems containing trees. Intercropping corn and marandu grass in a system without trees increased light interception at harvest time, indicating a larger soil coverage. Corn forage yield and dry matter content were lower when plants were 2 m apart from eucalyptus trees since this condition provided a lower amount of light and greater competition for water and nutrients.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21336/22273,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Sensitivity of urolithiasis detection using urinary, radiography and ultrasound parameters","Although many information has been published regarding canine urolithiasis, sensitivity of radiography, ultrasound and urinary parameters have been poorly correlated with number, size, and composition of the stones. One hundred and thirteen clinical files of dogs with diagnosis of urolithiasis were retrospectively selected. Information regarding number, appearance, location, size, and composition of the stones were noted after surgical removed. Urolithiasis data was compared with radiographs and ultrasound images and urinalysis parameters. Pure struvite was found in 42.4% and calcium oxalate in 35.6%. Survey radiographs enabled the detection of radiopaque stones and when an ultrasound examination was also performed, the sensitivity was increased. Double contrast radiography enabled identification in 100% of radiolucent stones, and allowed for size measurement and number counts in 76.9% of radiolucent stones. Crystalluria had low sensitivity (31.5%) and specificity (58.8%). Hematuria (96.3%) and leukocyturia (61.1%) were the most common parameters found. We concluded that double contrast radiography can be considered the method of choice for detection of radiolucent stones. Crystalluria is not a good parameter to detect or predict type of stone. Hematuria and leukocyturia, although non-specific findings, can be used as triage for investigation of urolithiasis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26758/22266,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Ovaries (n = 12) from heifers were processed for histology. From 789 multi-oocytes follicles observed, only 11 were considered appropriated for immunostaining, since they presented all nuclei of the oocytes clearly visible. All multi-oocyte follicles were positive for PCNA, but some oocytes showed no proliferative activity.

38,2017,Development and sensorial acceptance of biofortified cassava snack,"Cassava is the food base for millions of people in tropical Africa, Latin America and Asia. However, cassava commercial varieties are deficient in vitamin A and the consumption of biofortified cassava, which has a higher concentration of Beta-carotene in the roots, represents an alternative to prevent this deficiency. Dehydrated products are an integral part of many consumers’ diet, which have preferred healthier and lower calorie foods. This study aimed to develop a dehydrated product of cassava (dehydrated chips) from biofortified varieties. The dehydrated chips were elaborated from the following biofortified cassava genotypes: BRS Dourada, BRS Gema de Ovo, BRS Jari and hybrid 2003 14-11. For obtaining the dehydrated chips, cassava roots were washed, sanitized, peeled, sliced to a thickness of 0.8 mm, blanched and dehydrated at 65 °C. First, dehydrated chips were prepared with no added flavoring, from roots of four cassava genotypes harvested at 12 months after planting, in order to select the two most suitable for dehydrated chips production based on sensory acceptance. In the second stage, dehydrated chips were produced with the addition of onion and parsley flavoring, from the two genotypes selected in the previous step. The BRS Jari variety and hybrid 2003 14-11 showed highest total carotenoid content, 10.54 ?g g g-1 and 6.92 ?g g g-1, respectively, and  Beta-carotene, 8.93 ?g g g-1 and 4.98 ?g g g-1, respectively. For carotenoids and Beta-carotene retention there was no significant difference among the dehydrated chips prepared with four biofortified cassava genotypes, which showed average values of 76% and 67%, respectively. Dehydrated chips made with the BRS Jari and hybrid 2003 14-11 had highest average for flavor attribute and did not differ on the crispness and overall acceptance and classified between ""like slightly” and ""like moderately”. Despite the addition of ""onion and parsley"" flavoring, there has been no greater acceptance by consumers. Dehydrated cassava chips made with the BRS Jari variety and the hybrid 2003 14-11 showed good sensorial acceptance and higher total carotenoid and Beta-carotene contents, thus being biofortified varieties suitable for the elaboration of this product.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29643/22264,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Pork: profile of the West of Paraná consumers and physical evaluation of chop,"Pork consumption in Brazil is still low despite its productive importance. Relevant issues such as swine breeding, meat quality, and evaluation of aspects and attributes considered important by pork consumers at the time of purchase allows identifying consumer market demands. Moreover, physical parameters evaluation or pork cuts are suggested to certify the meat quality. The aim of this study was to identify the current situation of pig farming and determine the main aspects considered by consumers when buying pork in the Western region of Paraná state, Brazil. Furthermore, the physical properties of five pork chop brands marketed in the region were determined. Initially, an exploratory research was conducted involving ten pig farming sector professionals. This research allowed identifying that professionals understand the factors affecting meat quality and that some municipalities in the region are beyond their absorption capacity for pig production market. A descriptive research involving one hundred pork consumers showed that, although most prefer beef, 41% reported to consume pork 2 to 3 times a week. Pork chops and ribs are the preferred cuts, either fried or roasted. Details such as expiration date and federal inspection register were considered the most important aspects at the time of purchase, while price was the least important one. The meat color was the most mentioned sensory attribute. The physical analyses of five pork chop brands showed no pH difference (p > 0.05), water holding capacity, and cooking loss results, distinctive from the one observed for color (L*, a* and b*) and shearing force, which showed differences among the brands (p ? 0.05). Comparing pH and L*, it can be suggested that two brands showed normal meat characteristics, one DFD meat (pH > 6.0 and L* < 45), and other two brands PSE (pH < 5.8 and L* > 50). The research contributed to identifying features considered important by pork consumers, suggesting strategic actions to achieve greater preference and consumption index. The evaluation of physical parameters showed there is variability involved in pork chop quality as the samples were obtained from commercially different origins and under different processing and storage conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28964/22263,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,In-house validation for multi-residue analysis of tetracycline in cow milk by HPLC with UV detection,"The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in dairy cattle without complying with the waiting period results in residual contamination, whose effective control in produced milk requires validated methods toensure analytical results. The aim of this study was to optimize and validate the HPLC-UV/VIS method at 365 nm for analyzingthe tetracycline in pasteurized cow milk in accordance with the European Community (2002/657/EC). Spiked milk with analytes (oxytetracycline, tetracycline, doxycycline, and chlortetracycline) was submitted to deproteinization and cleaning by a C18 solid-phase column and analyzed by HPLC using a gradient system with 0.01 mol L?1 oxalic acid-acetonitrile-triethylamine (90:9.9:0.1) and acetonitrile on a reverse phase (C18) column. Accuracy and precision were assessed by adding analytes to levels of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 times the permissible maximum limit allowed in Brazil. The method presented selectivity with a decision limit (CC?) and detection capability (CC?) ranging from 114.2 to 143.7 and from 129.3 to 188.7 µg kg?1, respectively. The recovery of tetracyclines was higher than 82.5% with a precision of 7.1%, demonstrating theefficiency in determining tetracycline residues in cow milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26373/22261,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Extracts and semi-purified fractions of Tagetes patula flowers in the control of root-knot nematodes,"The genus Tagetes constitutes a group of antagonistic plant species that are cytotoxic against plant pathogenic nematodes, with T. patula being particularly efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of extracts and semi-purified fractions of T. patula flowers on eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, and M. paranaensis, as well as to verify the nematicidal effect of the flavonoids present in T. patula flowers. Extracts and semi-purified fractions were obtained from dried T. patula flowers after maceration and liquidification, yielding crude aqueous (CAE) and crude ethanol-water (CEWE) extracts. Dried flowers were also treated with n-hexane to obtain a crude defatted aqueous extract (CDAE) and a crude ethanol-water defatted extract (CEWDE). Then, the CEWE was fractionated, and the ethyl acetate (EAF), ethanol (EF), methanol (MF), and ethanol:water (EWF) fractions were obtained. CAE, CEWE, CDAE, and CEWDE were tested to evaluate their effects on hatching, mobility, and mortality of J2 of M. incognita, M. javanica, and M. paranaensis. EAF, EF, MF, and EWF fractions were tested on the same variables of M. incognita. All extracts significantly reduced J2 hatching of M. incognita, M. javanica, and M. paranaensis when compared to water and water + DMSO. CEWE had nematicidal effects on the three evaluated species, whereas CEWDE demonstrated nematicidal effects against M. incognita and M. javanica, and nematostatic effects on M. paranaensis. This toxic effect showed by CEWE may be related to the high content of quercetin, a major substance present in this sample. It was also observed that EAF accentuated the nematicidal response on Meloidogyne spp., suggesting that other medium polarity (methoxylated) flavonoids act as nematotoxic substances. Thus, these results suggest that quercetin contributes significantly to the nematicidal activity of CEWE and EAF.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30092/22260,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Morphophysiological quality of yerba mate plantlets produced by mini-cuttings,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphophysiological quality of yerba mate plantlets (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) produced by mini-cutting at four different times of year and cultivated in different containers. For the rooting of mini-cuttings, shoots of four yerba mate clones were collected four times during the year (April, July and October 2014 and January, 2015), cut into single-budded mini-cuttings and planted in equal proportions of pine bark-based commercial substrate, vermiculite and coarse sand. After 60 days of cultivation in a wet chamber, the rooted mini-cuttings were transferred to different containers: a 100 cm³ rigid polyethylene tube container and 500, 1500 and 3000 cm3 polyethylene bags containing pine bark-based commercial substrate and underground soil (2:1 v/v). A completely randomized design was used in a 4 x 4 factorial scheme, with five replications ranging from 5 to 20 mini-cuttings per experimental unit. The plantlets were evaluated for survival percentage, shoot height, stem diameter, shoot height/stem diameter ratio and number of leaves at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of cultivation. At 120 days of cultivation, 10 plantlets from each treatment were randomly picked to evaluate shoot and root dry mass, Dickson quality index, shoot height, surface area, total volume and number of root tips. The best combinations of shoot height, length, surface area, total volume and number of root tips and Dickson quality index were found in plantlets produced in July, 2014, followed by plantlets produced in October,2014 and January, 2015. The polyethylene bags allowed the production of yerba mate plantlets with satisfactory quality of shoot and roots, regardless of the volume. Yerba mate plantlets can be produced by mini-cutting from July to January in polyethylene bags.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29024/22259,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Natural contents of heavy metals in soils of the southern Amazonas state, Brazil","Heavy metals occur naturally in the soil as a product of rock weathering and, are commonly associated with environmental pollution and toxicity to living beings. This association deserves much attention since some heavy metals, such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Ni, are essential to plants. Our attention should thus be drawn not only to the element itself, but also to its contents in the soil. This is because its occurrence and quantities are covariates of the geomorphic, geologic, pedologic, and anthropogenic diversity. In this context, the present study aimed to determine the natural contents of heavy metals in the soils of three physiographic regions of the south of Amazonas state, comparing them to natural contents in some other Brazilian soils. Twenty-four soil samples were collected in three physiographic regions (field/forest, animated relief, and flooded/non-flooded areas), in the superficial and subsurface horizons. The digestion of the samples was based on the EPA-3051A method and the determination by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAnalyst 800 Perkin Elmer). The results indicate a low potential of soils from the south of Amazonas in supplying heavy metals, which were found in the following decreasing order: Ba > Fe > Cr > Pb > Zn > Cu > Mn > Co > Cd. The natural heavy metal contents vary depending on the type of soil, weathering level, and physiographic regions, and are similar or inferior to those observed in other regions of the country; with Neosols presenting the highest natural contents; and Cambisols, the lowest, for most of the metals evaluated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28702/22258,E-ISSN 1679-0359

For such purpose, tests that detect differences in the physiological potential of seed lots and that meet the minimum market requirements. Thus, the study was conducted towards assessing the efficiency of laboratory tests in differentiating the quality of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés seed lots. Seeds from nine lots were assessed regarding water content, germination, first germination count, electrical conductivity and seedling emergence in sand in the laboratory (normal seedlings, first count and germination rate index), and the results were compared with those from the seedling emergence test conducted in the field. The experimental design used was completely randomized, with four replicates, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the values from the germination, vigor and field seedling emergence tests was determined. The germination and seedling emergence in sand tests and the seedling emergence rate index efficiently assess the physiological quality of Brachiaria brizantha cv.

38,2017,Selectivity of insecticide use in soybean crop to the predator Podisus nigrispinus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae),"The selectivity of different insecticides to nymphs and adults of Podisus nigrispinus was evaluated in this study. Tests were carried out in the laboratory according to IOBC standard protocol. We evaluated different active ingredients that were applied using a Potter tower. Insect survival was assessed at 24-hour intervals for up to five days after exposure to treatments. Adult survivors of each treatment were assigned to breeding-pairs to evaluate possible effects on fertility. The pyrethroids bifenthrin, zeta-cypermethrin, beta-cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin alone or in mixtures with neonicotinoids and diamides, such as beta-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin + thiamethoxan and chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin, as well as the organophosphate, chlorpyrifos, were the most harmful (class 4 classification) insecticides for the preservation of P. nigrispinus for both nymph and adult predators. Conversely, the insecticide growth regulators (IGRs) lufenuron, teflubenzuron, triflumuron, tebufenozide and novaluron were classified as harmful (class 4) only for P. nigrispinus nymphs. These products were classified as harmless (class 1) and slightly harmful (class 2) for adult predators. Among the evaluated products, the most selective for P. nigrispinus were those belonging to the spinosyns (spinosad and spinetoram) and the diamides group (flubendiamide and chlorantraniliprole), which were classified as harmless (class 1) and slightly harmful (class 2) for both P. nigrispinus nymphs and adults. Next, the most selective product was methoxyfenozide, which ranged between slightly harmful (class 2) and moderately harmful (class 3) to nymphs and harmless (class 1) to adults of the natural enemy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27796/22255,E-ISSN 1679-0359

38,2017,Comparison of diets for rearing the larvae of Mediterranean fruit fly: nutritional and economic aspects,"The Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is the main pest of fruit crops worldwide due to its broad distribution, direct damages, and adaptation to different hosts. Developing diets for the rearing fruit flies is essential for integrated management of this pest. Mass rearing of parasitoids, selection of preferred hosts, and mass rearing of genetically modified C. capitata strains subsidize methods of biological control, cultural control, and the sterile insect technique (SIT), respectively, depending directly on the mass rearing of the Mediterranean fruit fly. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of artificial diets for rearing C. capitata larvae considering the cost of those most appropriate diets. Nine diets containing different combinations of protein and energy sources (brewer’s yeast, yeast extract, pollen, soybean extract, oatmeal, corn meal, and wheat germ) were formulated. The parameters immature development time (hatching), pupal viability (emerged adults), size and weight of pupae, and adult size (wing length) were assessed. The experiments were conducted in the laboratory under controlled conditions of temperature (26 ± 1 °C) and relative humidity (70% ± 10%). Statistical analysis was performed by using ANOVA with the Tukey’s test for comparison of means. Diets based on oatmeal and soybean extract, both added with brewer’s yeast, yeast extract, or pollen satisfactorily meet the nutritional requirements of C. capitata. Moreover, diets enriched with brewer’s yeast or yeast extract presented the lowest costs; therefore, they could be used in a continuous mass-scale rearing of C. capitata. Diets based on corn meal and soybean extract, both associated with brewer’s yeast, yeast extract, or pollen are more economical, but they should not be used for rearing C. capitata because they decrease the percentage of hatching and extend life cycle. Diets based on wheat germ and oatmeal, both added with brewer’s yeast, yeast extract, or pollen are not adequate for rearing C. capitata.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27211/22253,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Genetic diversity of tambaqui broodstocks in stock enhancement programs,"Natural populations of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) have significantly decreased in recent decades especially due to human extraction activities. So that the environmental impact may be reduced, the restocking of fish and increase in fish production are enhanced. Genetic evaluations using molecular markers are essential for this purpose. Current study evaluates the genetic variability of two tambaqui broodstocks used in restocking programs. Sixty-five samples (33 samples from broodstock A and 32 samples from broodstock B) were collected. DNA was extracted from caudal fin samples, with the amplification of four microsatellite loci: Cm1A11 (EU685307) Cm1C8 (EU685308) Cm1F4 (EU685311) and Cm1H8 (EU685315). Fourteen alleles in the stock of broodstock A were produced, five alleles for Cm1A11 locus (230, 255, 260, 270 and 276 bp), three alleles Cm1C8 (239, 260, and 273 bp), two alleles Cm1F4 (211 and 245 bp), four alleles for Cm1H8 (275, 290, 320 and 331 bp) and two unique alleles were found for Cm1A11 loci (alleles 270 and 276 bp) and Cm1H8 (alleles 275 and 331 bp). In broodstock B, ten alleles were produced, the same alleles of the first stock except for alleles 270 and 276 bp in Cm1A11 locus and 275 and 331 bp in Cm1H8 locus. Broodstock A revealed low frequency alleles in Cm1A11 loci, Cm1C8, Cm1F4 and Cm1H8, whereas broodstock B had no locus with low allelic frequency. Loci Cm1A11, Cm1C8 and Cm1H8 exhibited significant deficit of heterozygotes in both broodstocks, revealing changes in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic diversity between stocks was 0.1120, whilst genetic similarity was 0.894, with FST rate = 0.05, and Nm = 3.93, indicating gene flow between the two broodstocks. Results show that broodstocks are genetically closely related, with no great genetic variability. Strategies such as a previous genetic analysis of breeding with its marking, use of a large Ne crossing between the most genetically divergent specimens, and the introduction of new genetic material to broodstocks may maximize genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding within the next generation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26300/21085,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocytes in artificial beaches of Itaipu Lake, Paraná, Brazil","Cryptosporidiosis is an emerging zoonosis that causes many outbreaks worldwide. Its main route of transmission is the consumption of contaminated water or food. In Brazil, data on to the occurrence of cryptosporidiosis in animals and in humans are scarce; thus, it is important to determine the occurrence of Cryptosporidium sp. and to identify possible sources of water and food contamination in order to prevent the disease and, consequently, preserve of human health. From July/2011 to March/2012, five liters of water were collected in 10 different locations from eight artificial beaches of Itaipu Lake, Paraná, in a total of 40 samples. In two other small beaches of the lake, water was also collected from two different sites of each beach, given their size and because they were made up of water from different sources. Samples were analyzed by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique and nested-PCR (nPCR). All samples were negative in the modified Ziehl-Neelsen; only one (2.25%) sample was positive in nPCR. These results indicate that PCR is a more sensitive technique for the identification of Cryptosporidium in water samples. In this study, it was not possible to identify the species involved and, thus, the source of infection. Water contamination by Cryptosporidium oocytes can be caused by livestock kept near waterways, and by the people who use the place for recreational purposes. These results demonstrate risk for people who use the lake. Care should be determined to prevent the transmission of this important zoonosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24923/21115,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Ecophysiological responses of dual-purpose wheat originating from different cutting management systems,"Wheat is one of the most cultivated cereals worldwide. Some wheat genotypes may be used for dual purposes that is, in the production of animal fodder and grains. The objective of this study was to compare the growth, partitioning of assimilates, and seed vigor expression of dual-purpose wheat cultivars originating from seeds produced by plants subjected to different cutting management systems. Dual-purpose wheat seeds in the vegetative period were used for this study; these were obtained from the cultivar BRS Umbu produced by plants subjected to different cutting management systems. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme, with four replications. The treatments comprised a combination of four seed production systems (one, two, and three cuts) and eight planting seasons (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 days after emergence [DAE]). Total dry-mass, dry-mass production rate, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, leaf area index, solar energy conversion efficiency, dry-mass partitioning, seedling emergence in the field, and emergence speed index were evaluated. Data regarding seedling emergence and emergence speed index were adjusted by orthogonal polynomials. Primary growth data were evaluated from the simple logistic equation. From 60 DAE, an inversion of the values of total dry-mass was observed, and the maximum values were observed in plants from seeds produced without cutting management. The highest dry-mass production rates were noted for plants produced by seeds of plants not subjected to cutting management. The highest relative growth rates were noted among plants originating from seeds produced by plants subjected to three- and two-cut treatments. The net assimilation rate was higher in plants originating from seeds produced from plants subjected to cutting management systems. The highest values of emergence were observed for seeds obtained from the three-cut treatment. Similarly, an increase in the values of emergence speed index was observed in seeds from plants subjected to one-cut treatment. Dual-purpose wheat cultivars originating from seeds produced in the absence of cutting management presented higher total dry-mass, dry-mass production rate, and relative growth rate. The net assimilation rate was higher in plants from seeds produced with cutting management systems. Plants produced from seeds subjected to the three-cut production management resulted in more vigorous seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25787/21082,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Serological survey of lentivirus infection in goats and sheep slaughtered in the State of Paraíba, semiarid of Northeastern Brazil","The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of antibodies against small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) in goats and sheep slaughtered in the state of Paraíba, in the Northeast semiarid region of Brazil. Blood was collected from 500 goats and 500 sheep in slaughterhouses in the municipalities of Alhandra, Guarabira, Esperança, Picuí, Monteiro, Sumé, Patos, Piancó, Catolé do Rocha, and Sousa. The agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test was used for the diagnosis of SRLV infection. Of the 1,000 animals analyzed, 28 (2.8%) were seropositive, with a frequency of 3% (15/500) in goats and 2.6% (13/500) in sheep. It was also observed that no significant difference was present in seropositivity among the different municipalities. The low frequency of seropositive animals can be explained by the fact that most of the sampled animals came from extensive breeding herds consisting of meat production native breeds and crossbred animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23318/21114,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Genetic diversity of a natural population of Mezilaurus itauba (Meisn.) Taub. ex Mez. in the southern Amazon, Brazil","Genetic diversity studies in natural forest species populations have consistently expanded in recent years. Considering that biodiversity is directly related to genetic variation among and within populations, its study has become essential to the knowledge of genetic patterns. The study assessed genetic diversity of a Mezilaurus itauba population, detecting similarity and dissimilarity evaluating distribution intensity of adult and juvenile trees in remnant rain forest fragments in southern Amazon, Brazil. Leaf and cambium samples were randomly collected from 36 reproductive individuals. Eleven RAPD (random-amplified polymorphic DNA) primers were tested for genetic similarity analyses. The obtained data demonstrated that the species presented 79.77% polymorphism among the loci observed, with genetic diversity occurring between juvenile and adult trees. The population studied presented genetic diversity, forming three well-distinguished groups.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26135/21081,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of propolis extract on the parasite load of Nile tilapias reared in cages,"Due to increase in demand for healthy and chemical residue-free products, natural therapeutic substances are being enhanced in fish cultivation. Current study evaluates in an unprecedented way (he effect of propolis on the parasite charge of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared in fish cages. Six hundred male Nile tilapia (200g) conditioned in ten 1 m3 cages were used. Two treatments with five replications each were provided: TCON: control (extruded meal without propolis) and TPRO: extruded meal with 4% propolis extract. Parasite collection occurred on 0, 35, 70 and 105 days. At the same time, fillet was weighed and fish standard length measured. Temperature was kept within the comfort range for the species during the experimental period ( > 25ºC). Trichodinids and Monogenoids (Dactylogyridae) were detected in the two treatments. There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) in mean parasite intensity (total parasites/specimens with parasites) and abundance (total parasites/examined specimens) among treatments in the four evaluation periods. Lowest parasite prevalence occurred after 70 days in TPRO (26.66%). There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) among treatments with regard to fillet weight and standard length of fish. Results show that propolis extract 4% did not significantly affect parasite load, fillet weight and standard length of Nile tilapia.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27131/21080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Agronomic and nutritional characteristics of Massai grass subjected to deferred grazing and nitrogen fertilization,"This study aimed to evaluate the agronomic characteristics and nutritional value of Massai grass (Megathyrsus maximus ‘Massai’) pastures fertilized with different nitrogen levels and subjected to deferred grazing. A completely randomized experimental design (CRD) was adopted, with including five nitrogen levels (zero, 100, 200, 300, and 400 kg ha?1), and five replications (plots). The degradability trial used a CRD including a 6 × 5 factorial arrangement, consisting of six rumen-incubation times (6, 24, 48, 60, 84, and 96 h) and five levels of nitrogen in different plots. One fistulated sheep, with a live weight of 60 kg, was used in the experiment. Total herbage biomass, dead herbage biomass, and height showed a quadratic response to nitrogen fertilization levels of 100 to 200 kg ha-1 resulted in greater tillering. Protein and dry matter content increased linearly with nitrogen fertilization level, leading to increase in fibrous components. The increase in NDF and ADF contents might be a consequence of the reduction in NCE, and the high flowering rate of the grass, owing likely to the reduction in metabolism of the grass in an attempt to extend its lifetime. Nitrogen levels of 300 kg ha?1 or higher affected the productive characteristics positively, whereas the chemical characteristics were negatively affected.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26884/21079,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Fermentation kinetics and ruminal parameters of animals fed diets containing Brazil nut cake inclusion levels,"The inclusion effect of 0 (control), 15, 30, 45, 60, and 100% dry matter (DM) of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) cake (BNC) aiming at replacing corn silage was assessed on fermentation kinetics and effective degradability (ED) by means of in vitro gas production at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. A randomized block design was used with six treatments, three blocks, and two replications per block. France’s model was fit to the data. An in vivo experiment, conducted in fistulated ovine, assessed the effects of BNC inclusion levels of 0, 15, 30, and 45% DM replacing corn silage on ruminal parameters. Ruminal fluid samples were collected postprandial at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 h for determining the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), pH, and N–NH3. A completely randomized design with repeated measures in time was used, with four treatments and three replications. Results of acetate, propionate, butyrate, acetate to propionate ratio, pH, and NH3 were submitted to analysis of variance and regression (linear and quadratic) considering treatment, time and interaction of both. In addition, the F test with a 5% (P < 0.05) significance level was applied to the data. Fermentation kinetics pattern and ED presented a linear decreasing (P < 0.05), which means a decrease in total gas production at each coproduct inclusion level. No interaction effect between treatment and time was observed for total SCFA (P > 0.40), acetic acid (P > 0.41), propionic acid (P > 0.85), butyric acid (P > 0.62) and pH (P > 0.57). BNC replacements of 0, 15, 30 and 45% did not change (P > 0.05) total SCFA concentration, as well as acetic acid concentration in ovine. When including 45% DM of BNC, concentrations (mMol/100 mL) of propionic (P < 0.001) and butyric (P < 0.022) acids was reduced in the ruminal fluid. The highest concentrations at measurement times were observed 4 hours after feeding. The pH values presented a quadratic effect on both inclusion (P < 0.001) and time (P < 0.001). An interaction was observed between treatment and time for N–NH3 concentration (mg/ml) (P < 0.001) and acetic to propionic acids ratio (P < 0.014). Fermentation kinetics was negatively affected by Brazil nut cake inclusion to corn silage-based diet. Therefore, the use of this coproduct is recommended associated with non-structural carbohydrate sources.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26843/21078,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effects of processing and the physical form of diets on digestibility and the performance of nursery piglets,"The aim of this study was to assess the influence of various diet processing methods and physical forms on digestibility and zootechnical performance parameters of nursery piglets. The study was performed in 2 phases. The first phase was performed twice with 120 piglets per experiment, for a total of 240 newly weaned piglets, in a randomized block design with 6 treatments and 5 replicates (30 pens). The following experimental diets were offered from weaning to 21 days after weaning (initial nursery phase) and included the following: mash diet (M); mash diet conditioned at 60ºC (CM); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 2.5 mm (P2.5); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 2.5 mm and crumbled (P2.5C); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 4.75 mm (P4.75); and diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 4.75 mm and crumbled (P4.75C). The animals’ daily weight gain (DWG), daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion (FC) were assessed. Phase 2 used 24 piglets (33 days old) from Phase 1, which were lodged in individual metabolic cages. The experiment employed a randomized block design with 4 treatments and 6 replicates: mash diet (M); mash diet conditioned at 60ºC (CM); diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 2.5 mm (P2.5); and diet pelleted at 60ºC/matrix 4.75 mm (P4.75). Feces were collected to analyze the digestibility of and apparent digestible energy in dry matter, gross energy and ether extract. The processing and physical form of the diets did not affect the DWG and DFI of the 21- to 39-day-old piglets. The 2.5-mm-diameter pellets induced better FC compared to the crumbled and conditioned crumbled diets (P < 0.05), which might be attributed to the better digestibility of the ether extract in the pelleted diets. Pellet size had no effect on the performance parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26631/21076,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Carcass and meat traits, and non-carcass components of lambs fed ration containing increasing levels of urea","The objective of this study was to evaluate the carcass and meat traits, and the non-carcass components of crossbred Dorper lambs fed diets with increasing levels of urea (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of dry matter – DM). The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments (urea inclusion levels) and six replicates per treatment. Lambs were fed ad libitum for 56 days and slaughtered at 37.9 ± 5.1 kg of body weight (BW). The weight and yield of carcass before and after cooling were not influenced by urea levels, with average values of 16.9 kg and 44.6% for cold carcass weight and yield. Urea levels did not affect the morphometric measurements, the fat deposition on the carcass, the weight of carcass cuts and the weight of non-carcass components. There was a quadratic effect of urea levels on the loin yield, which may achieve maximum value of 11.31% with the inclusion of 0.84% DM urea in the feed. The pH and the color coordinates L* (brightness), a* (red intensity) and C* (saturation) of the meat also showed quadratic response to the urea levels, where in the minimum value of 5.53 for pH, maximum value of 48.67 for L* and minimum values of 14.04 and 16.21 for a* and C* may be obtained by including 0.53 to 0.70% DM urea in the ration. The inclusion of 0.84% DM urea in the ration is recommended to obtain maximum yield of loin and meat with attractive characteristics to the consumer, which is characterized by high red intensity and brightness. If consumers have preference for lamb meat with a more intense red color, the inclusion of 1.5% DM urea should be considered in the ration formulation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26733/21077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of husbandry system on the technical and economic performance of dairy cattle,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of husbandry system on the technical and economic performance of dairy farming. Samples included data from 61 dairy farms from the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which were collected between 2002 and 2011. Farms were categorized by type-pasture-based (PB), semi-confinement (SC), and confinement (C)-and technical and economic indexes were compared. In general, the results indicated indexes that are higher than the average for Brazilian farms but lower than those in other countries or technological farms in other Brazilian regions. Milk production was mainly determined by farm size rather than by productivity indexes. Components of the total and effective operational costs that were most significant were feeding followed by labor. The comparative analysis indicated that, although C systems have technical indexes that are superior to those of the PB and SC systems, economic performance was independent of the intensification level. Thus, pasture systems are potentially competitive, provided that the producers are efficient.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26596/21075,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Anthelmintic treatment and supplementation in Nellore calves performance in the post-weaning period,"The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of anthelmintic treatment and supplementation of post-weaning Nellore calves. The parasitism degree, hematological changes and animal performance were analyzed, as well as the financial viability. One hundred contemporary Nellore calves were used. Animals were divided into four groups: CS+AT: supplementation with concentrate and anthelmintic treatment; CS: supplementation with concentrate; PS+AT: protein mineral supplementation and anthelmintic treatment; PS: protein mineral supplementation. Coproparasitological, hematological, and cost examinations were performed, and productive performance was also evaluated. A completely randomized design was used. Animals that received CS+AT showed greater weight gain. In females, there was significant difference in egg counts per gram of feces only between the CS and PS+AT. In males, animals receiving CS+AT, CS, and PS+AT differ from those receiving PS. No significant effects were observed for total plasma protein, packed cell volume, and eosinophils count. Females which received PS+AT and males who received CS+AT showed higher profitability. This study concludes that effective anthelmintic use is still viable, with higher profitability associated with concentrated supplementation in males, and mineral protein supplementation in females. Male calves show better return over investment when compared to females, due to the higher market value and higher potential performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26579/21074,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Structural characteristics of elephant grass fertilized with organic composted waste from production and slaughter of small ruminants,"This study aimed to evaluate the morphophysiological characteristics of irrigated Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cameroon subjected to doses of an organic compost from waste generated by production and slaughter of small ruminants. The experiment was carried out in a grassland, during four growth cycles of 60 days. The area is located in the Embrapa Caprinos e Ovinos unit, in Sobral - CE, Brazil. Treatments consisted of organic compost doses (0, 13.3, 26.6, 39.9, 53.2 and 79.8 Mg ha-1) plus a mineral fertilization (nitrogen and potassium) at doses equivalent to 720 and 900 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively. The experimental design was arranged in completely randomized blocks, totaling four blocks with seven treatments each, in a split plot scheme with repeated readings over time. The plots corresponded to seven doses of an organic compost and an additional treatment (mineral fertilizer), and subplots to four growth cycles. The variables analyzed were total herbage biomass (THB), canopy height (CH), tiller population density (TPD) and water use efficiency for green leaf biomass production (WUEGLB) and green stem biomass (WUEGSB). In the first cycle, TPD decreased linearly with increasing doses of the compost, with 47 tillers m2 at the dose of 79.8 Mg ha-1, while THB and WUEGLB variables behaved quadratically, with a maximum point of 23.53 Mg DM ha-1 cycle-1, and 16.33 kg DM mm-1 for the doses of 66.52 and 62.94 Mg ha-1 of the organic compost. We concluded plant structural characteristics and water use efficiency were responsive to applications of the organic compost, and we recommend the dose of 67.7 Mg ha-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26505/21133,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Genetic parameters of growth traits in Nellore cattle,"This study evaluated non-genetic factors and calculated heritability estimates of direct and maternal effects for growth traits in Nellore cattle raised in southern Brazil. Performance records of 4170, 1538, 3139, 1830, and 1151 calves born from 2005 to 2011 were analyzed for birth weight (BW), adjusted120-day weight (W120), adjusted 205-day weight (W205), adjusted365-day weight (W365), and adjusted 550-day weight (W550), respectively. The components of (co)variance used to calculate heritability estimates were determined by Derivative-Free Restricted Maximum Likelihood using the MTDFREML software. Contemporary groups were included in the model as fixed effects, and direct and maternal effects, permanent environmental effects, and residual errors were included as random effects. Phenotypic correlations were estimated using the PROC CORR procedure from SAS. Overall means for BW, W120, W205, W365, and W550 were 38, 138, 201, 270, and 376 kg, respectively. Heritability estimates for direct and maternal effects were 0.17 ± 0.04 and 0.11 ± 0.03 (BW), 0.14 ± 0.03 and 0.03 ± 0.04 (W120), and 0.17 ± 0.04 and 0.09 ± 0.03 (W205). Genetic, phenotypic, and environmental correlations were 0.79, 0.44, and 0.32 for BW and W120, 0.79, 0.39, and 0.26 for BW and W205, and 0.96, 0.74, and 0.75 for W120 and W205. The results indicate that selection for pre-weaning weight would be more efficient using W205, and genetic correlation coefficients indicate that selection at any age should produce a positively correlated response at older ages. Genetic, phenotypic, and environmental correlation coefficients between W365 and W550 were 0.99, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively. Selection for adjusted 550-day weight should produce the greatest genetic gains. Genetic correlation coefficients between weight traits indicate that selection for weight at older ages, which could help reduce the number of weighings and increase accuracy of selection at younger ages, produces gains at older ages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26439/21105,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of planting pattern of forage sorghum on forage productivity and heifer performance during finishing phase,"This study aimed to assess the effect of sorghum planting patterns on forage response and performance of beef heifers at finishing phase. The experimental period lasted 84 days; treatments consisted of the combination of two interrow spacings (22 and 44 cm) and two sorghum-sowing rates (12 and 24 kg ha?1). Beef heifers, at finishing phase, with initial age of 15 months (± 2.3 months) and average body weight of 262 kg (± 37.95 kg), continuously grazed forage. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme with three repetitions per area. The different planting patterns did not affect (P > 0.05) dry matter production (5,447.78 kg DM ha?1) and accumulation rate (58.47 kg DM ha?1 day?1). Forage accumulation rate, leaf mass, forage mass, leaf supply and forage supply were influenced (P < 0.05) by time. Similar behavior was observed for stocking rate, weight gain per area unit and daily weight gain, with values of 1,172.32 kg of liveweight ha?1, 312.31 kg ha?1; 0.891 kg day?1, respectively. Animal performance had no effect (P > 0.05) from planting patterns, with nearly 4.04 mm of subcutaneous fat thickness and final weight of 330.36 kg. Animal body development showed no significant differences (P > 0.05), with values for length, heart girth and hip height of 132.01, 163.75 and 126.75 cm, respectively.

38,2017,Carcass and meat of two genetic groups of cattle fed two levels of grass-Convert silage in feedlot,"Assessment of carcass and meat characteristics of Nellore young bulls or dairy crossbred young bulls fed two levels of grass-Convert silage in the rations (400 and 100 g kg-1 of dry matter). Sixteen Nellore young bulls and 16 dual-purpose dairy young bulls (Holstein x Gir and Holstein x Guzerá) with average initial body weight of 378.8±13.8 kg were used. The experimental design was completely randomized with treatments in a 2x2 factorial arrangement. The proportion of silage and the genetic group did not change the percentage of muscle, fat and bone of the carcass. The yield of the primary commercial cuts was not altered by the level of silage. The pistol cut weight was higher in Nellore young bulls compared to dairy crossbred young bulls (125.8 vs. 119.5 kg), while the relative weight of short ribs was higher in dairy crossbreds (11.9 vs. 11.5%). Only the muscle cut of the pistol was altered by silage proportion in the rations, being higher in those with the lowest proportion of grass silage. On the other hand, only the relative weight of flat, rump cap and edible lean trims were altered by genetic group, which were higher in Nellore young bulls. Among the characteristics of the meat, only marbling was significantly changed, being higher in dairy crossbreds fed rations with a lower grass-silage proportion. The genetic group did not alter the other meat characteristics. Nellore young bulls produce carcasses with higher yield of valuable meat cuts in relation to dairy crossbred young bulls.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26433/21071,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Tissue damage and embryonic malformation induced by aqueous extract of Pteridium aquilinum on chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo (CAM),"The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of Bracken fern (BF) (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn.) on biological systems. When consumed by animals can cause acute intoxication, hematuria, biochemistry alterations and cancer. To humans the toxicity is associated with its intake on contaminated ground water or milk and inhalation of its spores. In order to check the BF aqueous extract (AEB) deleterious effects on animals blood vessels system, chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was used. It were applying on CAM 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 e 15 µg/mL of AEB and saline as control. The angiogenesis was analyzed and the vascular density index (VDI) calculated. The CAM samples were prepared and stained with H&E to evaluation of microvessels, Masson’s trichrome to characterize collagen and fibrin deposition and Picro-sirius used to evaluate collagen using polarized light. Also the morphological aspects of embryos were analysed. We observe on the results of neovascularization that AEB did not change significantly the number of vessels/mm², however, membranes treated with AEB (5 or 10 µg/mL) exhibit opacity and tissue fibrosis, both signs of inflammation. Histological analysis with Masson's trichrome and picro-sirius on tissues exposed to AEB respectively has shown increased collagen fibers and presence of fibrilar collagen. The embryos exposed to concentrations of 5 or 10 µg/mL AEB, showed changes as poor face formation and poor closing of abdominal wall. The highest concentration of AEB (15 µg/mL) was lethal to embryos. Although significant effects on the CAM’s vasculature has not observed, tissue aggression was detected, a desmoplasia (an extensive inflammatory signal triggered by tissue injury), changes caused on embryos as well as the presence of toxic substances in the AEB show us an important and deleterious pathway of this bracken fern extract on its intoxicants effects on humans and animals, and even cancer or the death of animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26194/21069,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Morphological characteristics, dry matter production, and nutritional value of winter forage and grains under grazing and split nitrogen fertilization","Morphological characteristics, dry matter production, and nutritional values of winter forage and grains were evaluated. This study was conducted from April 24, 2012 to November 7, 2013 in the Western Paraná State University (UNIOESTE), Marechal Cândido Rondon, Brazil. Pastures under one grazing and non-grazing conditions were evaluated under 120 kg N ha-1 fertilization split into two 60 kg N ha-1 treatments. Two pastures received 40 kg N ha-1 three times. IPR 126 oat, BRS Tarumã wheat, and IPR 111 triticale were the test crops. Topdressing with 40 or 60 kg N ha-1 did not change morphological characteristics until 60 d after sowing. Pastures under non-grazing that received 120 kg N ha-1 treatments were taller than the controls, whereas those under grazing that received 80 or 120 kg N ha-1 presented with higher leaf production than did the controls. Total average dry matter (DM) production in 2012 and 2013 was, respectively, 5,275 kg ha-1 and 6,270 kg ha-1 for oat, 3,166 kg ha-1 and 7,423 kg ha-1 for wheat, and 4,552 kg ha-1 and 7,603 kg ha-1 for triticale. Split N fertilization did not cause differences in the levels of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in the forage. Nevertheless, increases in in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were observed in oat and wheat receiving 60 kg N ha-1 during the first graze. IVDMD did not change in oat, wheat, and triticale forages receiving 80 or 120 kg N ha-1 during the second graze. Grazing did not affect the nutritional values of wheat and triticale grains, but reduced those of oat. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that grazing lengthens the crop cycles, and so allow the staggered sowing of summer crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26320/21103,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of propolis extract on angelfish larval performance and transport,"This study aimed to evaluate the influence propolis extract inclusion to the feed mixture for juvenile angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) on larval performance and transport. Levels of propolis extract inclusion consisted of 0, 300, 600, 900, and 1200 mg.kg-1 of feed. After 14 days of hatching, unmetamorphosed larvae with a total length of 18.4 mm and 0.11 g initial weight were used. Six-hundred larvae were divided into 20 experimental units, totalizing 30 larvae each. Experimental units consisted of polythene containers with independent water input and output and a level controller. Each unit was controlled for maintenance of 40 L water within a recirculation system. After offering feed containing propolis extract, five fish from each experimental unit were packed in bags for transportation only with atmospheric air, without pure oxygen addition. The bags were filled with 300 mL water on a 2:1 basis of air and water respectively. The total transport time was considered until the death of the third fish in package. At the end of the experiment, data underwent statistical analysis through Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 2001). Results showed there was no significant difference (P < 0.05) neither for any of the studied zootechnical variables (standard length, total length, height, and weight) nor for the transport of juveniles. In conclusion, propolis extract addition to angelfish feed was ineffective for larval performance and for transportation of juveniles, at the levels tested here.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26187/21068,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Available phosphorus reduction in weaned piglets’ diets containing phytase combined with butyric and benzoic acids,"This study aimed to evaluate the reduction of available phosphorus (Pa) in the diet of weaned piglets using phytase combined with butyric and benzoic acids. A total of 120 piglets with initial weight of 6.7 ± 0.02 kg were used in a randomized block design with six treatments: control; reduction of 0.15% Pa (Pa red); Phytase + Pa red; Phytase + butyric acid + Pa red; Phytase + benzoic acid + Pa red; Phytase + butyric acid + benzoic acid + Pa red; five replicates, with four animals each. The experimental diets had no influence on the fecal scores, Escherichia coli count, or the pH of the digestive tract. An improved villus:crypt ratio was found when the combination of phytase with butyric and benzoic acids was used. The histomorphometry of the jejunum and of the ileum showed no differences with respect to villus height, crypt depth, and villus:crypt ratio. The bones of the piglets fed with a diet containing reduced levels of available phosphorus showed less resistance to fracture. The levels of calcium in the raw bones were lower in the piglets that received a diet containing phytase and butyric acid. Reduced phosphorus deposition was observed in the bones of animals that received the diet containing phytase, butyric acid, and benzoic acid. It is concluded that the inclusion of phytase and butyric and benzoic acids, and their combination, in the diet of weaned piglets does not affect the pH of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon, and does not change the frequency of diarrhea or the E. Coli count. The association of butyric and benzoic acids with phytase in the diet of piglets after weaning improves the villus:crypt ratio of the duodenum. The use of phytase (1000 UF/kg) allows the formulation of diets for weaned piglets with a 0.15% reduction in the level of available phosphorus without damaging the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the bones and without altering bone resistance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26110/21067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Nutritional quality of massai grass fertilized with phosphorus and nitrogen and its influence on intake and weight gain of sheep under rotational grazing on quartzipsamment soil,"The effects of phosphate and nitrogen fertilization on aspects of forage composition and ruminal fermentation were separately evaluated pre- and post-grazing, in addition to the dry matter intake and weight gain of sheep grazing Panicum maximum cv. Massai under a rotational system on Quartzipsamment soil. The aim was to evaluate the effect of fertilization with different levels of phosphorous (50 and 200 kg P2O5/ha) and nitrogen (100 and 400 kg N/ha) compared to unfertilized control soil. The experiment was conducted at the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science at Universidade Federal do Tocantins – UFT, in a randomized complete block design with four replicates in a factorial 2 × 2 design. The study area consisted of 32 paddocks (301 m²), each of which had previously been sown with Panicum maximum cv. Massai. The experimental area was managed under intermittent stocking with a variable stocking rate. Twenty-eight crossbreed sheep were used for grazing management. Evaluations were made before and after grazing, including forage evaluation and measurement of ruminal degradability and intake (using titanium dioxide as the external marker). Regarding the forage composition, a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed between the control and fertilizer treatments for neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber, crude protein, lignin and phosphorous content. Fertilization was found to alter the nutritional quality of Panicum maximum cv. Massai grass. Among the nutritional aspects evaluated, fertilization influenced NDF, grass digestibility and dry matter intake. The forage composition of Massai grass is improved by fertilization with nitrogen at 100 kg N/ha and phosphate up to 50 kg P2O5/ha, which represents a relevant management practice for increasing quantity and quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25796/21112,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,The effect of cancellous bone grafts on time to consolidation at osteotomy site following tibial tuberosity advancement in dogs,"Rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament is the main cause of lameness in dogs. Several surgical techniques are used as a treatment, especially osteotomies, as the tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA). Recently new research are being conducted investigating ways to reduce bone healing time. Cancellous bone grafting is considered to be the gold standard method to speed healing due to its osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cancellous gone grafts on the time taken for consolidation at the osteotomy site in dogs undergoing TTA surgery. TTA surgery was performed in 19 stifles in which there was rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament and a tibial plateau angle less than 27 degrees. The cases were divided into two groups: dogs in the control group (C) had TTA only and for those in the study group (E) TTA was complimented with a cancellous bone graft. Serial radiographs were evaluated at 21 day intervals post-surgery and consolidation was confirmed by visual inspection by three observers (two radiologists and an orthopedic surgeon). There was no difference in consolidation time between Groups C and E. The addition of cancellous bone grafting to the osteotomy did not influence time to consolidation in dogs undergoing TTA surgery.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26262/21116,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Comparative analyses of thoracic radiographs and bronchoalveolar lavage of dogs and cats with chronic bronchial diseases,"There is a high incidence of bronchitis and asthma cases in veterinary medicine. Thoracic radiographs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are commonly performed for definitive diagnosis in dogs and cats with suspected bronchitis and asthma. It is believed that a combination of diagnostic tools is the best choice to achieve a diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thoracic radiographs and BAL in the diagnosis of chronic bronchial disease (CBD) in dogs and cats and whether there is any specific radiographic finding that could influence the indication for bronchoalveolar lavage. It was performed a cross-sectional, prospective, observational study including forty client-owned dogs and cats with lower respiratory tract signs and positive radiographic opacities that were evaluated with BAL followed by cytology and culture. The radiographic results compared with BAL culture showed a sensitivity of 38%, specificity of 95% and accuracy of 65% in detecting patients with pneumonia associated with chronic bronchial disease. Thoracic radiographs were effective in diagnosing 65% of the patients, radiographs plus BAL cytology diagnosed 75% of patients and the combination of radiographs, BAL cytology and culture diagnosed 95% of the patients with chronic bronchial disease. In conclusion, the combination of radiographic examination with BAL followed by cytological and microbiological analyses increases diagnostic success in CBD.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26282/21010,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Influence of commercially available follicle stimulating hormone on the in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes,"The work aimed (Experiment I) to compare commercial representations of porcine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH, Pluset® vs. Folltropin®) in concentration (10 ?g/mL) and time (24 h) standard (more used in protocols of in vitro maturation, IVM); (Experiment II) to evaluate the best incubation time (6 h vs. 16 h vs. 24 h) and, (Experiment III) analyze varying concentrations (1.0 ?g/mL vs. 2.5 ?g/mL vs. 10.0 ?g/mL) of representations of FSH on the IVM of bovine oocytes. Thus, oocytes were recovered and submitted to IVM under appropriate conditions. After the IVM, oocytes were evaluated for expansion of cumulus cells (CCs), presence of the first polar body (1PB) and metaphase plate (MII). All the data were analyzed by the Fisher exact test (P < 0.05). Initially, in Experiment I, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed in maturation rates of the oocytes incubated with FSH Pluset® or Folltropin®, assessed by expansion of CCs (97.6% vs. 94.3%), presence of 1PB (76.6% vs. 69.4%) and MII (70.0% vs. 68.6%). In Experiment II, when the incubation time with FSH was evaluated, both Pluset® as Folltropin® showed lower rate of expansion of CCs when they were present only in the first 6 h of IVM. As for presence of 1PB, differences were observed in relation to Pluset® while Folltropin® showed similar results in all incubation times. Regarding the MII, no difference was observed between the incubation times with FSH Pluset® and Folltropin®. In Experiment III, no difference was observed in the expansion of CCs, presence of 1PB and MII for concentrations evaluated FSH Pluset® and Folltropin®. Therefore, the FSH Pluset® and Folltropin® have the same efficiency in IVM of bovine oocytes. Regarding the incubation time, it is recommended to maintain FSH (Pluset® or Folltropin®) throughout the period of IVM, since there was no difference in the results of presence of MII. Furthermore, the concentration of 1.0 ?g/mL of FSH Pluset® and Folltropin® is as effective as 10 ?g/mL and can therefore be used for IVM of oocytes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26118/21009,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Immunohistochemical and serological aspects of Toxoplasma gondii infection in Neotropical primates,"Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the intracellular coccidian Toxoplasma gondii that infects most warm-blooded vertebrates, is widely distributed and fatal for primates, which are peculiarly susceptible for unknown reason(s). Owing to the increasing number of Neotropical mammal deaths where in T. gondii were detected in analyzed tissues, the present immunohistochemical study analyzed the distribution patterns of immunostainings related to this parasite on primates necropsied at the Laboratório de Patologia Animal of Universidade de Passo Fundo (UPF), between the years of 2000 and 2014. Furthermore, a serological survey for the disease was conducted for 21 primates from the UPF Zoo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, belonging to genera Sapajus and Alouatta. In a immunohistochemical test performed using streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase, 26.53% positivity was detected in 98 primates. Immunostainings revealed that infection differed among the lung (76.92%), liver (58.33%), heart (50%), brain (42.30%), and kidney (23.07%) tissues. Serology performed through indirect hemagglutination showed reactivity in 85.7% of the animals, all belonging to Sapajus sp., while the three primates that did not show reactivity (14.3%) belonged to Alouatta sp.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25982/21007,E-ISSN 1679-0359

38,2017,Effect of age and cyclical heat stress on the serum biochemical profile of broiler chickens,"This study aimed to evaluate the influence of age and cyclical heat stress for 1 hour per day on the levels of serum proteins, metabolites, and enzymes in broiler chickens of 21-42 days of age. We used 420 male broiler chickens, Cobb Avian48TM breed, in a completely randomized experimental design, composed of two treatments and six replicates. The treatments consisted of two thermal environments: one in which broiler chickens were raised under natural conditions of temperature and humidity for the first 42 days of age (control) and another in which chickens were subjected to heat stress at 36°C, from days 16 to 42, for 1 hour per day (1200-1300 hours). At 21, 28, 35, and 42 days of age, approximately 5 mL of blood was collected by cardiac puncture in two birds per replicate. In each serum sample, levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity and uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and glucose levels were determined. Concerning the environment and the age, no significant differences in the levels of glucose, uric acid, ALT, triglycerides, and very low density lipoproteins were observed. There was a significant interaction between the environment and the age for cholesterol and LDL values. At 21 days of age, cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) were higher in birds under stress than in the control treatment birds, which did not occur in other age groups. Aspartate aminotransferase activity was higher in chickens under cyclical heat stress than in chickens subjected to control treatment and displayed a cubic response regarding the environment. The age of the birds influenced the values of total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio, creatinine, GGT, and HDL. In conclusion, cyclical heat stress, at 36ºC, for one hour, from days 16 to 42 of age increases serum AST, whereas cholesterol and LDL-C levels increase only at day 21, indicating that birds may have adapted to heat stress. Age influenced the activity of AST and GGT and levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin, A:G ratio, cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26009/21008,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Prevalence of equine infectious anemia in stud farms in Minas Gerais, Brazil","Horse breeding is expanding in Brazil. Nevertheless, equine infectious anemia (EIA) a transmissible, incurable disease is an obstacle to the development of the horse industry. Therefore, to determine the incidence of EIA at stud farms in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, a serological survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence and identify potential risk factors for equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) transmission. This was the second stage of an ongoing study on the epidemiology of the disease, which was first observed in draft horses. A sample of 7,742 equids from 717 stud farms in seven regions within the State was tested between May 2004 and January 2006. Laboratory tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and agar gel immunodiffusion were conducted for screening and confirmation, respectively. The prevalence of EIA was estimated to be 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.00-0.871) at the farm level and 0.07% (95% CI=0.00-0.251) at the animal level. The low prevalence of EIA in stud farms might be explained by the higher zootechnical value of stable-bred animals, which leads to periodical serological control and compliance with the slaughter of test-positive animals in order to keep the farm EIA-free. Moreover, stable-bred horses usually travel more and are subjected to more official controls than are draft horses. The highest prevalence of EIA was observed in regions 1 (North/Northwest of Minas Gerais) and 2 (Vale do Mucuri/Jequitinhonha), with rates of 0.34% and 0.72%, respectively. These results show that the prevalence of EIA at stud farms in Minas Gerais is generally low, with the prevalence being higher in the northern part of the State (regions 1 and 2). A previous serological survey on EIA among draft horses showed a very similar distribution of EIA infection in Minas Gerais. These results suggest a very similar pattern of EIA distribution across the State and irrespective of zootechnical value, but the northern/northwestern regions have a higher prevalence than do the southern regions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23982/21041,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Evaluation of animal performance, feed intake, and economic losses in sheep experimentally infected with Trypanosoma vivax","Trypanosoma vivax is a protozoan originating from the African continent, which, although it has not yet been able to complete its biological cycle in South America, due to the absence of the tsetse fly, can still cause death in ruminants. The objective of this study was to verify the effects of T. vivax on the measurements and indices in sheep that characterize animal performance, as well as on economic losses in meat animals. Twenty intact adult male sheep were used for this study, all of approximately the same ages and weights, reared in confinement, and subjected to the same management and diet, which was balanced and supplemented with adequate minerals. The animals were divided into two groups: the control group (CG) and the infected group (IG), which was inoculated intravenously with 1.3 x 105 trypomastigotes of T. vivax. Feed intake was verified daily, whereas the feed conversion (FC), feed efficiency index (FEI), and weight gain were obtained weekly. Total weight gain (TWG) was determined after 70 days post-infection. The economic loss was calculated by subtracting the value obtained (IG) from the expected value (CG), and the difference was expressed as a percentage. A randomized block design was used to isolate the effect of the initial weight. The means were compared by the Student “t” test at 5%. Of the 10 infected animals, one died from the parasitism, yielding a rate much lower than that observed in natural outbreaks. The groups presented similar feed intakes throughout the experimental period; however, the TWG of the infected group was significantly lower (50.7%) than that of the CG. Similarly, the daily weight gain (DWG), feed conversion (FC), and feed efficiency index (FEI) of the IG were significantly lower than those of the CG. In addition, the worst rates of FC and FEI coincided with parasitemia peaks and recurrences, probably due to immunological demand and tissue repair. The abdominal circumference of the infected animals was statistically lower than that of the CG, which may be directly related to fat mobilization, in addition to the possible negative effect on the digestive capacity. The economic losses due to weight alone were 24.07% and could reach 31.66% of the herd value due to animal death. Infection with T. vivax negatively affected animal performance indices, even when the animals were well nourished. Trypanosoma vivax in sheep destined for slaughter caused economic losses of 31.66% due to the decrease in performance and the death rate in the infected group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23534/21003,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Preoperative epidural administration of lidocaine-methadone or lidocaine-fentanyl in female dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy,"We compared the analgesia and cardiopulmonary changes induced by epidural methadone or fentanyl in combination with lidocaine in female dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy and anesthetized with propofol. Eighteen female dogs were randomly assigned to two groups and given either methadone (0.3 mg kg?¹) + 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor (LM) or fentanyl (5 µg kg?¹) + 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor (LF). The drugs were administered epidurally in a volume of 0.25 ml kg?¹. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and blood glucose levels were recorded before and 15 minutes after premedication (T0 and T1); 15 minutes after epidural administration (T2); five minutes after dermotomy (T3); five minutes after clamping of the ovarian pedicle (T4); five minutes and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours (T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, and T11, respectively) after surgery. The number of additional propofol injections and total propofol dose (mg kg?¹) were recorded. Analgesia was assessed using a numerical descriptive scale. SBP and HR were similar in both groups, but hypotension was detected in animals from both groups at different times. Respiratory rate decreased significantly at T6 in the LF group and was lower than in the LM group. Hypothermia was observed in animals from both groups, but RT was significantly lower than baseline values only at T4 in the LM group. Blood glucose levels increased significantly only in the LF group at T4, T7, and T8. All animals in the LF group and eight animals in the LM group required additional propofol injections at T4, but no significant differences were detected in the number of propofol injections and total propofol dose between the LF (3 ± 1 injections, 7.5 ± 4.5 mg kg?¹) and LM (2 ± 2 injections, 4.5 ± 3.4 mg kg?¹) groups. The latency period, anesthetic period, and the duration of surgery were similar in both groups. No animals required rescue analgesia. The lidocaine-methadone and lidocaine-fentanyl combinations caused minimal cardiorespiratory changes, but did not abolish pain at the time of handling of the ovarian pedicle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22084/21001,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,One-step laparoscopy for the correction of left abomasal displacement in high-yielding Holstein dairy cows,"Surgical procedures for the correction of abomasal displacement are one of the most frequently performed in dairy cows, and many surgical techniques have been described since the first cases of this disease were reported in the 1950s. Although no report to date has described the use of one-step laparoscopy in Brazil, the technique has several advantages over the traditional techniques, e.g., better abdominal visualization and minor trauma resulting from the minimally invasive technique. Accordingly, one-step laparoscopy, as described by Christiansen and Barisani, was performed to treat left abomasal displacement in 21 high-yielding dairy cows from two dairy regions of Paraná State. The technique was performed without complications in 12/21 (57.14%) cows. Ruminal (four animals), abomasal (two animals), both ruminal and abomasal (one animal), and splenic (one animal) perforations occurred during surgery but without any postoperative complication. One cow developed pyloric obstruction caused by the toggle bar suture, but early removal restored abomasal flux. Three animals died of different causes. One cow showed recurrence of displacement 1 month after surgery. A third access was necessary in cows that weighed more than 700 kg. One-step laparoscopy is an efficient, fast, and safe technique for the correction of left abomasal displacement.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23276/21002,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Critical points and magnitude of impacts on the packing line: effect on ripening and quality of 'Packham's Triumph' pears,"Pears have a very sensitive epidermis and are prone to signal mechanical blemishes, which result in reduced visual quality and low consumer acceptance. The objective of this work was to identify critical points and the magnitude of impact forces on a packing line at a commercial packinghouse. The effect of injuries on ripening and quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears was also evaluated after cold storage. The packing line was scrutinized on its transfer points, fruit drop heights and cushioning overlays, which allowed to acquire the maximum accelerations on each spot. The maximum acceleration forces were reproduced in the lab with ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears to evaluate the effects on fruit quality after cold storage. Four critical points were noticed on the packing line: at the transfer from the conveyor belt to the lifting rollers, at the transfer from the lifting rollers to the washing ramp with rotatory brushes, at the entrance to the singulator at the end of the conveyor belt and at the drop from the sizer to the packing stalls. Ripening of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears invariably came about during cold storage, and independently of the imposed impacts. The impacts under the circumstances of the test did not affect the quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears kept for up to 120 days at cold storage followed by five days at room temperature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25556/21111,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Blanching effect on the bioactive compounds and on the viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG before and after in vitro simulation of the digestive system in jabuticaba juice,"The viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in jabuticaba juices and its survival in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), simulated in vitro, was studied. Two juices were prepared: A - with non-blanched fruits, and B - with blanched fruits. LGG was then added and the juices maintained at 8 ºC for 28 days. The control treatment consisted of juices without the added probiotic. The following were determined in the juices: the viability and in vitro survival of LGG, fecal coliforms, Salmonella sp., pH, acidity, total soluble solids (TSS), color, antioxidant capacity, total phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and ascorbic acid. The sensory acceptability was also determined using a 9-point hedonic scale. Blanching interfered (p < 0.05) with the viability of LGG, juice A showing the greatest viability as compared to juice B. After in vitro simulation, the probiotic bacterial count was < 1.0 log CFU mL-1, which demonstrates the low resistance of the strain to the simulated GIT conditions. The juices were conformed to the microbiological standards established by law. The pH, acidity and TSS were influenced by blanching (p < 0.05), with values of 5.03, 0.46% and 15.38 °Brix for juice A and 5.12, 0.66% and 16.05 °Brix for juice B, respectively. The addition of LGG did not influence these characteristics. Only the pH value was influenced by the storage time (p < 0.05), increasing throughout storage. Juice B showed lower luminosity (L*) and a greater value for a* as compared to juice A, indicating that the former became darker and redder due to the blanching process. Both juices showed positive values for the b* coordinate. The juice was found to be a good source of polyphenols. Neither the time nor the addition of LGG affected the antioxidant capacity, total phenolic compounds or anthocyanin contents. However, blanching contributed (p < 0.05) to an increase in the contents of these compounds in the juices. Values for antioxidant capacity of 186.20 and 2552.59 uM Trolox g-1, for total phenolic compounds of 275.06 and 1163.18 mg GAE 100 g-1-wwb, and for anthocyanins as cyanidin 3-glucoside of 12.71 and 90.99 mg 100 g-1 were found for juices A and B, respectively. The juices contained 72.87 mg 100 mL-1 of ascorbic acid. Scores of above 6.0 (liked slightly) were awarded on the hedonic scale for the attributes evaluated. The addition of probiotics in jabuticaba juices needs to be further studied to ensure the viability of the cultures during storage and their survival in the gastrointestinal tract.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26307/21000,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Influence of cooking methods on bioactive compounds in beetroot,"Beetroot is rich in bioactive compounds that may provide health benefits. However, vegetable tissues are physically and chemically damaged by cooking, causing major changes to compounds in cell membranes. The current study aimed to evaluate the influence of several cooking methods on bioactive compounds in beetroot. Four heat treatments were carried out: steam cooking, pressure cooking, baking in an oven, and boiling in water. Beets were matched in uniformity of size, color, and absence of defects. They were washed thoroughly in running water to remove dirt. Next, one of the four cooking methods was applied. After cooking, beets were peeled by hand. Analysis was carried out on both uncooked and cooked beets to evaluate antioxidant activity, content of phenolic compounds, pigments, flavonoids, and betalains. The experiment was completely randomized design (CRD) and carried out in triplicate. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (F test, p < 0.05) and mean values compared by Tukey test at 5% probability. There was no change in antioxidant activity or total phenolic and anthocyanin content by any of the cooking methods compared to that in raw beetroots. However, pressure-cooking resulted in lower carotenoid levels compared to that in raw beet. Furthermore, flavonoid and betalain content decreased by all the cooking methods.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26355/21044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Biological control of bacterial spot of tomato by saprobe fungi from semi-arid areas of northeastern Brazil,"Bacterial spot of tomato, caused by Xanthomonas spp., is a common disease in tomato fields that causes significant economic losses. Due to the difficulty with control of bacterial spot by conventional methods, new techniques such as biological control and induction of resistance are gaining prominence. This study aimed to select saprobe fungi from semi-arid regions of the Brazilian Northeast for the biological control of bacterial spot of tomato. To select the best isolates to control bacterial spot, a greenhouse experiment was initially conducted. Tomato plants (‘Santa Cruz Kada’) were treated with filtrates of 25 saprobe fungi and inoculated three days later with Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. Filtrates of Memnoniella levispora, Periconia hispidula, Zygosporium echinosporum, and Chloridium virescens var. virescens were selected as the most effective. Filtrates and volatile compounds from these four isolates were tested for their antibacterial activity in cultures of X. euvesicatoria and in tomato plants (‘Santa Cruz Kada’) inoculated with X. euvesicatoria. In vitro, the addition of nonvolatile fungal metabolites into the culture medium at 5% and 50% (v/v) inhibited bacterial growth by 28.9% and 53.8%, respectively. The volatile compounds produced by C. virescens var. virescens reduced the number of colony-forming units of X. euvesicatoria by 25.9%. In vivo, all treatments reduced from 62.4 to 71.3% the area under bacterial spot progress curve, showing the same control efficacy as the commercial resistance inducer used as a positive control (acibenzolar-S-methyl). Systemicity of the fungal filtrates was confirmed in a separate experiment, where application of the treatments exclusively to the third leaf decreased the severity of the disease on the fourth leaf (except for C. virescens var. virescens). These results show that M. levispora, P. hispidula, Z. echinosporum, and C. virescens var. virescens are potential biocontrol agents against bacterial spot of tomato. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the disease control mechanisms of saprobe fungi.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26413/21104,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Genetic, environmental and genotype x environment interaction effects on the common bean grain yield and commercial quality","The objective of this study was to assess the effects of environmental and genotype x environment (GxE) interaction on the commercial quality and grain yield of common bean for the identification of new cultivars for the South Central and Central regions of Brazil, that combine high adaptability/stability for grain yield, sieve yield (SY) and 100-seed weight (100M). Sixty-two trials were performed in a randomised block design with three replicates in different sowing seasons in the South Central (Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS)) and Central (Goiás (GO) and Distrito Federal (DF)) regions in 2009 and 2010. In the trials, 16 “carioca”-seeded lines were evaluated, and grain yield, SY and 100M were collected. The data were then subjected to individual and joint analyses of variance and to adaptability and stability analyses using the Annichiarico method. Genetic variation was found between the lines for all three traits. Coefficient of determination estimates showed that the genotype effect was more important for commercial quality than for grain yield and that the environmental effect was equally important for all three traits, indicating that the highest possible number of environments should be tested. The highest-yielding lines in the Brazilian Central (CNFC 11954 and CNFC 11959) and South Central (CNFC 11948) regions were different, indicating the importance of GxE interactions for yield. However, the two best lines in the Central Region had low commercial grain quality. Thus, CNFC 11948 will be recommended as the new cultivar selected for broad adaptation because it combines high commercial quality with increased mean grain yield and stability in the South Central Region and better yield and stability than the main controls in the Central Region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26106/20997,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis, and brucellosis seroepidemiology in veterinary medical students and their relation with unique health","Toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis, and brucellosis are global zoonoses, with humans as accidental participants in their transmission cycles. The can also be considered occupational diseases, because certain professionals are at greater risk of contact and infection by such zoonoses. These three diseases have different epidemiological characteristics because of the distinct environmental, social, cultural, and economic conditions where these pathogens circulate. Because of the importance of these diseases and their associations with specific occupations, we performed a seroepidemiological survey of Toxoplasma, Leptospira, and Brucella antibodies, with an analysis of the association between positive serum and certain occupational and environmental variables, in students of a veterinary medicine course (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th year) in a university in the northwestern region in the state of Paraná, Brazil. From May to November 2014, blood samples were collected from 157 volunteers by professionals trained in nursing and biomedicine from the same university as the veterinary students. At the time of blood collection, the students did not present any clinical signs of the three diseases of interest. To detect anti-Toxoplasma gondii, anti-Leptospira spp., and anti-Brucella antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence test (IIF), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), fast agglutination test (a screening test), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed. To determine variables associated with these infections, the students were interviewed to complete an epidemiological questionnaire with environmental, behavioral, and occupational information. The associations between these variables and infections were assess by chi-square or Fischer's exact tests, with a 5% significance level (?). Of the 157 serum samples analyzed, 29.29% reacted to Toxoplasma antigens, with titers ranging from 16 to 4096 by IIF, 1.27% to Leptospira antigens, with titers ranging from 100 to 800 by MAT using Hardjo and Wolffi serovars, and 0.63% to Brucella antigens by ELISA; however, no variables were found to be associated with infection with any of these pathogens. The results of this study show that one-third of the students in the veterinary medicine course were exposed to Toxoplasma gondii, Leptospira spp., and Brucella spp. at some stage in their lives; however, it is not possible to determine whether these infections were acquired at the university, because no associations between occupational risk variables and these infections were found. An understanding of the transmission of each etiological agent and methods to prevent infection is important to maintain low prevalence levels of these zoonotic diseases during the veterinary medicine course and extra-curricular internships, when there is increased exposure to these pathogens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25899/21005,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Banana fertigation with treated sanitary wastewater: postharvest and microbiological quality,"Sewage may serve as a source of water and nutrients for plants. In this study, the effects of fertigation with treated sanitary wastewater from Janaúba Sewage Treatment Plant were evaluated on the postharvest and microbiological quality of ‘Prata-Anã’ banana. A randomized block experimental design was used. Four concentrations of wastewater were tested (70, 130, 170, and 200% of 150 kg ha-1 sodium). A wastewater-free control treatment was used for comparison. Two crop cycles were assessed for postharvest and microbiological quality. The parameters measured included total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio, pH, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms on both the peel and the pulp. In the first crop cycle, both soluble solids and fruit pulp pH decreased as wastewater level increased up to a maximum of 141.5%. These correlations were not observed in the second cycle. Wastewater management did not affect the titratable acidity of the soluble solids. The agricultural application of treated sanitary wastewater provided banana fruits with a microbiological profile similar to that obtained with the control (pure water) and with mineral fertilizers. A microbial balance is necessary to maintain the nutritional status of the banana crop.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26068/20996,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Agronomic performance of the Maciel peach with different rootstocks,"The rootstock influences the agronomic performance of fruit plants. In Prunus persica (peach), particularly those varieties produced in Brazil, this relationship is not well understood. We, therefore, set out to evaluate the performance of the peach cultivar Maciel with eight rootstocks, Aldrighi, Capdeboscq, Flordaguard, Nemaguard, Okinawa, Umezeiro, Tsukuba, and Seleção Viamão, planted in 2006 and evaluated in the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 seasons. Phenology of flowering, trunk diameter, canopy volume, fruit number, and yield were evaluated in the field. For the fruit, we evaluated the mass, diameter, color, flesh firmness, soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity, concentration of total phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity. Plants from the Aldrighi and Nemaguard rootstocks flowered earlier than plants from the other rootstocks in 2014, and in 2015, flowering was variable in all rootstocks. The cultivar Maciel on Umezeiro had low vigor, trunk diameter, and canopy volume. On Aldrighi, Capdeboscq, Flordaguard, Nemaguard, and Tsukuba this cultivar showed good production rates. The fruit color, flesh firmness, concentration of soluble solids, total phenolics, antioxidant activity, and total carotenoids were influenced by rootstock and harvest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25972/20995,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Selectivity of the herbicide linuron sprayed in pre-emergence and post-early in carrot,"Herbicide application is a method for weed control in carrot crops. However, the choice of the chemical treatment (herbicide, association of products, dose, and time of application) should consider its selectivity to the crop. It is desired to analyze the selectivity of linuron for carrot plants, when sprayed on pre-emergence and post-early cultivated plants. Two experiments were carried out in the field in an area of the commercial production of carrots, one with the Verano cultivar and the other with BRS Planalto. Both experiments included an experimental design with randomized blocks in a factorial 2 x 4 + 1 with six and four replications for the experiments with Verano and BRS Planalto, respectively. The herbicide linuron (675 and 990 g a.i. ha-1) was sprayed at four times, counting from the carrot sowing day: in the pre-emergence of the crop at 0, 3, and 6 days after sowing (DAS) and in the post-early emergence at 9 DAS, when the plants had 1 or 2 cotyledons. An untreated control was maintained as an additional treatment. Linuron was selective for the carrot plant cultivars Verano and BRS Planalto, in both doses tested, when sprayed in the pre-emergence, up to six days after sowing, and in the post-early (plants with 1 or 2 cotyledon leaves) at nine days after sowing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25907/20993,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Prospecting for sludge bacteria from a poultry slaughterhouse, with potential for degrading organic substances","The sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants of slaughterhouses is a rich source of chemical, organic, and microbiological constituents that can be biotechnologically exploited. The purpose of this study was to (i) conduct a chemical analysis of the sludge, and (ii) isolate, quantify, and describe the amylolytic, cellulolytic, ligninolytic, proteolytic, and keratinolytic bacteria in the sludge. Sludge samples were collected at the wastewater treatment plant of the Francap SA poultry company. The nutrient contents, C/N ratio, and pH were determined. For the bacterial count, 10 g sludge was diluted in 90 mL saline solution, which was serially diluted to 10-12. Aliquots of 100 µL of each dilution were transferred to selective media for isolation of bacteria that degrade organic substances. The colony-forming units were determined for each culture medium. Individual colonies were purified and characterized morphologically. The sludge contained 9.5, 1.21, and 0.45 dag kg-1 of N, P, and K, respectively. Fifty-two isolates were purified and characterized, with 2.11 × 1012 to 9.55 ×1015 colony-forming units per g sludge. In conclusion, the sludge generated in poultry slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plants is a rich source of organo-mineral constituents and bacteria with biotechnological potential for degrading organic substances.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25953/20994,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Influence of the sowing depth and amount of sugarcane straw on the emergence of Chloris polydactyla and Eleusine indica and their control by herbicides applied pre-emergence,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the sowing depth and amount of sugarcane straw on the soil on the emergence of Chloris polydactyla (‘capim-branco’) and Eleusine indica (Indian goosegrass) and to determine the efficacy of herbicides applied pre-emergence in the control of these species under different straw amount and rainfall regime conditions. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications. In the first experiment, the effects of six sowing depths (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 cm) and six sugarcane straw amounts (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha -1) were assessed on the emergence of Indian goosegrass and ‘capim-branco’ in a 6 x 6 factorial arrangement. In the second experiment, the efficacy in the control of these species was evaluated for one control without herbicide and five treatments (indaziflam, metribuzin, tebuthiuron, indaziflam + metribuzin, and indaziflam + tebuthiuron) applied pre-emergence over four straw amounts (0, 1, 2, and 4 t ha-1) in a 6 x 4 factorial arrangement. This experiment was evaluated under two rainfall regimes in separate experiments (simulation of 20 mm of rainfall 1 or 10 days after herbicide application). The ‘capim-branco’ showed a marked reduction in emergence beginning at 2 t ha-1 of straw and a 2 cm sowing depth. For the Indian goosegrass, the decline in emergence mainly occurred beginning at 4 t ha-1 of straw and a 4 cm sowing depth. Only some of the Indian goosegrass plants emerged at the greater sowing depths (8 and 10 cm) and straw amounts (8 and 10 t ha-1), whereas no emergence of the ‘capim-branco’ was observed under these conditions. The treatments with sowing at a 1 cm depth and with 0, 1, 2, and 4 t ha-1 of straw provided the highest emergence percentage for the species. Application of the herbicide indaziflam alone was the only ineffective treatment for the control of the weeds regardless of the amount of straw and the water regime used. We concluded that the increase in the sowing depth and the amount of straw significantly reduced the emergence of the species and that the presence of straw and the dry period interfered with the herbicide efficacy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25892/20992,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Land use and land cover mapping and identification of misuse in the permanent preservation areas in the Tailândia Municipality - PA,"The objective of this study is to expand the mapping of land use and land cover, as well as of the permanent preservation areas (PPAs), and identify land misuse areas in the PPAs in the Tailândia municipality in the state of Pará, which is part of the Amazon biome. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to achieve these goals. Mapping and classification for the year 2012 were made by visual interpretation of images obtained from the RapidEye satellite, which has a 5 m spatial resolution. In this work, we identified nine classes of land use and land cover. From the hydrography vectors it was possible to determinate the Permanent Preservation Areas of the bodies of water according to the environmental legislation. Analysis of misuse in the PPAs was made by crossing-checking the land use and land cover data with that of the PPAs. The results show that 53 % of the municipality (2,347.64 km²) is occupied by human activities. Livestock farming is the activity that has most increased the use of area (30 %), followed by altered vegetation (14.6 %) and palm oil (7.2 %). The PPAs have a high percentage of misuse (47.12 %), with livestock being the largest contributor, occupying 26.65 % of the PPAs, followed by altered vegetation (12.64 %) and palm oil (4.29 %). Therefore, the main objective in Tailândia is to reconcile economic activity with sustainable development. It is important to emphasize the partnerships between the government, research institutions, regulatory agencies, states departments and local communities, else it would be impossible to monitor or control an area as vast as the Amazon.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25738/21110,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effects of variable-row-spacing harvesting picker platform scraping plates on cotton fiber quality and quantity,"There have been increasing demands for high-quality cotton fibers that meet the textile industry quality standards. Concurrently, there have been efforts to reduce contaminants during harvesting to reduce harvesting costs. The goal of this research was to evaluate the efficiency of the picker platform with Variable-Row-Spacing (VRS) for harvesting cotton in narrow rows, over two harvest seasons in two regions within the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. In this study, how the presence vs. absence of scraping plates and variations in travel speed was related to quantifiable levels of impurities the harvested fibers was examined. The research was divided into three experiments (Exp. I, II, and III), using cotton varieties FM 975 WS, IMA 5672 B2 RF, and IMA 5675 B2 RF, with row spacing of 0.45 m. The experimental design was randomized blocks, in a 2 ? 3 factorial design, using the presence/absence of the plate and three speeds (0.61, 1.0, and 1.42 m·s-¹), with seven repetitions, totaling 42 experimental plots. The plot size was 108 m² (3.6 ? 30 m). The data were analyzed using the F test in ANOVA and the post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0.05). The results showed that scraping plates increased the number of stems and cones, and reduced the harvest efficiency of cotton planted in narrow rows in the region of Sorriso-MT during the 2013/2014 harvest. For the 2014/2015 harvest, the highest speed and the presence of the scraping plates increased the number of cones in the cotton samples. In the experiment conducted in Serra da Petrovina, the removal of the scraping plates decreased the amount of cones in the harvested cotton.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25802/20989,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Germination and vigor of linseed seeds under different conditions of light, temperature and water stress","Linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), cultivated from seeds, is one of the oldest plants domesticated by humans and is popularly used as a medicine. It can be used as the raw material to produce oil and bran because it has high lipids content, fiber and proteins. Based on the economic potential of this species and the need for more information about its physiology, the goal of this study was to analyze the effects of light, temperature and water stress on the germination and vigor of linseed seeds. In experiment I the seeds were sown on paper at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25 and 30 ºC in the presence and absence of light. In experiment II, the seeds were placed on paper germitest soaked in solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) at osmotic potentials corresponding to zero, -0.10, -0.20, -0.30, -0.40, -0.50 and -0.60 MPa. To evaluate the physiological potential, the following tests were made: germination, first germination count, length and dry mass of seedlings, and water stress. It was found that the highest percentages of germination and vigor occurred at a constant temperature of 20 °C, both in the presence and absence of light. The reduction of the osmotic potential of the substrate promoted a significant decrease in the germination and vigor of the linseed seeds. Osmotic potentials equal or less than -0.30 MPa were harmful to germination and there was no normal seedling development starting at -0.50 MPa.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25781/20988,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Hydration curve and physiological quality of maize seeds subjected to water deficit,"The hydration pattern associated with the physiological quality of seeds can be an early indicator for the evaluation of seed quality. The present study aimed to evaluate the hydration pattern of seeds subjected, or not, to water restriction, and to relate these patterns to their physiological quality. The physiological quality of seeds from five maize strains (L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) and four hybrids (HT1, HT2, HS1, and HS2) was initially determined using seed germination and vigor tests (accelerated ageing and electric conductivity). A completely randomized experimental design was used with four repeats for the physiological analyses and a regression analysis was performed in order to assess the behavior of the seeds over time. The hydration curve was determined by imbibing the seeds in distilled water (0.0 control) and in a -0.9-MPa osmotic solution of polyethylene glycol 6000. Water uptake by the seeds was found to follow a triphasic pattern in the absence of water stress (0.0 MPa); however, when exposed to a -0.9- MPa osmotic potential, an extended phase II was observed. Diversity was observed between the strains in terms of the hydration pattern of the seeds, which can influence the physiological quality of the hybrid seeds. Regarding the hybrids, a positive relationship was observed between the shortest time to root protrusion and the quality of the seeds, both with or without water restriction, which allows us to conclude that hydration pattern can be used as a parameter for the early evaluation of physiological quality in hybrid maize seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25827/20991,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Does competition between soybeans and Wild Poinsettia with low-level resistance or susceptibility to glyphosate affect physiology and secondary metabolism?,"The Wild Poinsettia (Euphorbia heterophylla L.) has elevated potential to reduce the soybean yield and is a difficult to control plant due to herbicide resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine the changes in the photosynthetic physiological parameters, secondary metabolite levels, cellular damage, and antioxidant system activity in soybean plants and Wild Poinsettia biotypes with a low level of resistance or susceptibility to glyphosate in competition with soybeans. Two replacement series experiments were conducted in a greenhouse under competition between soybeans and the low-level resistant biotype (experiment I) or susceptible biotype (experiment II). The treatments consisted of different proportions of soybean plants and Wild Poinsettia [100:0 (pure stand of soybean), 50:50, and 0:100 (pure stand of Wild Poinsettia)] and different evaluation periods (the 2013/14 and 2014/15 growing seasons). The following parameters were analyzed: the chlorophyll, carotenoid (CRT), total phenol, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and lipid peroxidation levels and the catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity. Generally, competition between the soybeans and the Wild Poinsettia biotypes did not alter the photosynthetic parameters or the photosynthetic pigment levels of the crop. For the weed biotypes, competition with the soybeans negatively affected photosynthesis. Greater losses of chlorophylls and CRTs were observed for the susceptible biotype when in competition with soybeans, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the biotype with a low level of resistance. No cellular damage or alterations in antioxidant system enzyme activity was observed, which indicated a lack of oxidative stress.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25314/20986,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Status of persistent organic pesticide residues in water and food and their effects on environment and farmers: a comprehensive review in Nigeria,"Pesticide helps to enhance agricultural production, however, it significantly affect both socio and environmental entities of a country. In Nigeria, pesticide is widely used, thus its traces have been detected in water, soil and air. Several studies have already indicated that most of the environmental ecology (air, water, and soil) in Nigeria has been contaminated by persistent organic pesticides like organochlorine and organophosphate. Other reasons of high pesticide residues present in Nigeria environment is due to inappropriate dosage applied of pesticides that leaves behind excess. However, its residues are found above safety levels in the air, water, and soil across the nation. Based on previous analysis, it is indicated that 125,000-130,000 metric ton pesticides are being applied annually in Nigeria. Despite banned of some pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane- and -Hexachlorocyclohexane, they are still being used by farmers in their agricultural production. Many of the Class 1 (high extremely toxic) pesticides are still being used in developing countries like Nigeria. Hence, there is need to sensitize and educate the general public especially the end-users (farmers) particularly on management practices of pesticides. Considering these entire hazardous situations, in this article the history of pesticide used in Nigeria has been reviewed in detail. The article also discussed the effects of pesticide use in Nigerian waters, soil and on crops. The risk of residual pesticide on agricultural workers, pesticide residue risk preventive measures by the Federal Government of Nigeria, banned and restricted pesticides in Nigeria, Nigerian Government and its efforts to eliminate persistent organic pesticides in use are also reviewed in details.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26637/21399,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Carbon dioxide quantified by the infrared in respiratory activity evaluation in corn seeds,"The respiratory activity is one of the first biological manifestations of vigor loss and detecting it can help the monitoring and quality control of seed production by seed industries. This research aimed to develop and validate the methodology of the carbon dioxide concentration in the evaluation of physiological quality of Zea mays (L.) seeds. The proposed method is grounded on the measurement of the CO2 content by infrared through a drag system and exhaustion of the gas released by the seed maintained in a closed system up to the detection chamber of the gas meter. Samples of 15, 20 and 25 seeds of 6 lots of cultivar CD 384 Hx were incubated at temperatures of 15, 25 and 40 °C. The CO2 content released after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h of incubation were quantified. In parallel, the percentage of normal seedlings emerged in the field were evaluated. The simple correlation coefficients among tests were calculated. After determining the reading conditions, the accuracy and precision of the proposed method were evaluated, using 15 seed lots. For the evaluation of the respiratory activity in Z. mays seeds, we recommend a sample of 25 seeds, incubated at 15 °C for a maximum of 12 h, which allows to classify lots with different levels of vigor and predict the establishment of seedlings in the field, being the appropriate method for measuring CO2 as it externalizes precision between successive measurements and agreement to the reference method.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24484/20985,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Influence of temperature and photoperiod on the germination of Senegalia bahiensis seeds,"Senegalia bahiensis (Fabaceae family, Mimosoideae subfamily) is typical of an anthropic environment, and thus tolerates high levels of disturbance, which supports its use in restoration planting. However, widespread use and marketing of S. bahiensis seeds requires seed quality control, for which there is a dearth of protocols. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and photoperiod on the germination of Senegalia bahiensis seeds from different matrix trees. Seeds were collected from fruits of 15 matrix trees in the municipality of Castro Alves, Bahia, Brazil. Two assays were performed, one for each parameter tested. The experimental design of both assays was completely randomized in a factorial design, and included three replicates of 25 seeds. The design of the first assay was 15 (matrix trees) × 3 (conditions - 25°C, 30°C and alternating temperatures between 25 and 30°C) and the design of the second assay was 14 (matrix trees) × 3 (conditions - 8 or 12 hours of light, or continuous light). The percentage of germination of normal seedlings, germination speed index, mean root length based on total seed number, shoot length, root length and total length were determined. The Tukey's test was used to compare mean values. The S. bahiensis matrix trees used in this study have different requirements in terms of temperature and photoperiod for seed germination. According to our findings, combining a temperature of 30°C and an 8 h period of light conveys the most suitable conditions to conduct germination tests for most matrix trees.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23181/20984,E-ISSN 1679-0359

38,2017,Effects of nitrous oxide on cardiovascular parameters in pigs anesthetized with propofol and subjected to pressure-controlled ventilation,"This paper evaluated the effects of the ratio of nitrous oxide to oxygen (50% of each) on cardiovascular parameters in pigs anesthetized with propofol and maintained in ventilation with intermittent positive pressure. Sixteen Large White pigs, weighing between 15 and 20 kg, were divided into two groups of eight animals, and designated as follows: GPN (propofol/nitrous oxide) and GPA (propofol/compressed air). In order to allow endotracheal intubation, the animals received azaperone (2 mg kg-1, IM) followed, after 20 minutes, by intravenous propofol. After successful intubation, continuous infusion of propofol was initiated at a dose of 0.4 mg kg-1minute-1. From this point, the GPN group received N2O (diluted in 50% oxygen), while the GPA group received compressed air (diluted in 50% oxygen). Rocuronium was then administered by continuous intravenous infusion at 0.6 mg kg-1h-1. Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) was started and adjusted to 15 cmH2O, and the respiratory rate was set to reach capnometry readings between 35-45 mmHg. The measurement of parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, stroke index) begun 15 minutes after the administration of rocuronium, and was repeated in 15-minute intervals for 60 minutes. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test. The results showed that the 1:1 ratio combination of nitrous oxide to oxygen (50% each) did not alter the mentioned parameters in pigs anesthetized with propofol and maintained at pressure-controlled ventilation, indicating that it is a safe protocol for the cardiovascular system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23009/21396,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Many molecular techniques used to understand the maturation of these fruits require high concentrations of highly purified RNA. However, melons are rich in polyphenolic compounds and polysaccharides, which interfere with RNA extraction. This study aimed to determine the most appropriate method for total RNA extraction from melon fruits. Six extraction buffers were tested: T1) guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform; T2) sodium azide/?-mercaptoethanol; T3) phenol/guanidine thiocyanate; T4) CTAB/PVP/?-mercaptoethanol; T5) SDS/sodium perchlorate/PVP/?-mercaptoethanol, and T6) sarkosyl/PVP/guanidine thiocyanate, using the AxyPrepTM Multisource Total RNA Miniprep Kit. The best method for extracting RNA from both mature and green fruit was based on the SDS/PVP/?-mercaptoethanol buffer, because it rapidly generated a high quality and quantity of material. In general, higher amounts of RNA were obtained from green than mature fruits, probably due to the lower concentration of polysaccharides and water. The purified material can be used as a template in molecular techniques, such as microarrays, RT-PCR, and in the construction of cDNA and RNA-seq data.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24726/21394,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Seed vigor and amount of soybean straw on seedling emergence and productive performance of wheat,"The use of high-quality seeds is essential to minimize the possible suppressive effect of straw on seedling emergence, contributing to stand establishment and high grain yield. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of seed vigor associated with soil cover with different amounts of soybean straw on seedling emergence and productive performance of wheat. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using two wheat cultivars (CD 150 and BRS Gralha Azul) under a completely randomized design in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme with four replications. Factors consisted of two seed vigor levels (high and low) and five amounts of soybean straw (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 t ha?1). The following assessments were performed: seedling emergence, dry mass of seedling shoot, number of tillers, plant height, yield components (number of spikes per plant, number of grains per spike, and mass of one thousand seeds), grain yield, and harvest index. The use of high vigor seeds favors the emergence and dry mass production of seedling shoot for both cultivars. The increased amount of soybean straw reduces seedling emergence in both cultivars. In the cultivars CD 150 and BRS Gralha Azul, the amounts of soybean straw of 2.45 and 5.40 t ha?1, respectively, result in a higher wheat grain yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24500/21443,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Characterization and typology of sheep and goat production systems in the State of Paraíba, a semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil","Breeding of goats and sheep is an important activity in northeast Brazil, contributing to economic and social development of this region. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize goat and sheep rearing and breeding in the central-western region of the State of Paraíba, northeast Brazil. The study area included Borborema and mesoregions of the backlands of the state, represented by 127 municipalities in an area of 38.293 km2, with density of goats and sheep at 12.9 and 8.27 head/km2, respectively. A total of 62 farms belonging to five municipalities of the Borborema mesoregion and four municipalities of the Sertão mesoregion were surveyed. Epidemiological surveys were conducted in the farms, and questionnaires sought information on the economic, productive, and social aspects of the farm owners and the farms. The results allowed the classification of goat and sheep production systems in the semi-arid Paraíba as a family system and of subsistence, for farmers’ own consumption and for local trade, with low technology use and herds with up to 100 animals. The farmers’ level of education was low, and the investments and technical assistance for the development of breeding activity in the region were insufficient and/or inadequate. Thus, it was essential to conduct an economic study on the farms to assess the actual economic and financial status of breeding activity and the subsequent returns. It is suggested that these aspects be taken into account when planning livestock development policies, especially in terms of finance and technical assistance, as well as in the implementation of strategies to control commonly occurring diseases in the region, aimed at combating agents, environmental control, and protection of susceptible livestock.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27346/21441,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Frequency of concentrate supplementation for grazing beef cattle,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of frequency of concentrate supplementation on the daytime feeding behavior (grazing, rumination, drinking, and idle times), production performance, and economic viability of grazing cattle in the rainy season. A total of 120 uncastrated Nellore animals with an average body weight (BW) of 382.5 ± 32.2 kg were allocated to palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) paddocks for the experiment. We evaluated supplements provided in the amount of 2.0 kg/animal, supplied three times weekly (3tw) or daily (7X). Animals supplemented 3X (5.46%) spent more time (%) drinking water than those supplemented 7X (3.72%). Grazing time and animal performance were not influenced by the frequency of supplementation. Average daily gain was 1.00 and 1.02 kg/animal for the groups under 3X and 7X, respectively. Expenditures on transportation and labor are lower (43%) when animals are supplemented 3X. Supplementation provided three times per week does not affect the grazing time or the performance of beef cattle in the rainy season, but rather implies an expressive reduction of expenditures on labor and distribution of supplements.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27134/21405,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Nutritional value of tifton 85 bermudagrass at two cutting heights and different times of storage,"The goal of this study was to assess the dehydration curve and nutritional value of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at two cutting heights from ground level (4 and 8 cm) during 120 days of storage in a closed shed. The dehydration curve was determined using samples from the entire plant at eight different times. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and five replicates. The second step consisted of assessing the nutritional value of the stored Tifton 85 bermudagrass in randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and two treatments per plot: cutting height of four and eight centimeters from the ground, and five different times for the subplots, with five replicates. Dehydration of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at the two heights occurred in 48 hours, considered an ideal time for hay drying. The dry matter content responded quadratically to the time of storage of the two heights, only differing during baling and after 120 days of storage. Crude protein content had a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, with the smallest value after 30 days of storage (107.0 g kg-1) and the largest after 90 days (147.8 g kg-1) in the cutting height of eight centimeters. The ether extract exhibited a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, only differing after 90 days of storage. The neutral detergent fiber content had linear positive response according to the time of storage, with no difference between the cutting heights. For the neutral detergent fiber content in the two cutting heights, the quadratic regression model was the best fit to the data, differing between the heights after 30 and 60 days of storage. In vitro dry matter digestibility and in vitro cell wall digestibility values of the stored hay were lower than the values obtained at the time of cutting. Cutting performed at four centimeters from the ground was the most suitable for hay production due to higher dry matter production and nutritional value without difference between bailing treatments. Hay storage caused undesirable changes in the nutritional value, especially in fiber content and in vitro digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27039/21387,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Waste from the biscuit and noodle industries in Nile tilapia diets,"The objectives of this work were to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and gross energy (GE) of coconut biscuit residues (CBR), sweet biscuits (SBR) and noodles (NR) for Nile tilapia and evaluate the performance of fingerlings fed with diets containing the residues with the highest nutritional value. In the digestibility study, 72 juveniles (with an average weight of 70.5 ± 2.7 g) were organized in a completely randomized design with three treatments and three replications (12 fish per replication). ADC was determined using an indirect method in which 0.10% chromium oxide (Cr2O3) acted as an indicator. To evaluate performance, 225 fingerlings (with an average weight of 3.4 ± 0.5 g) were distributed across 15 tanks (150 L), creating a completely randomized design with five treatments and three replications. The test diets contained 0, 4, 8, 12 or 16% CBR. ADCDM, ADCCP and ADCGE for each of the different residues were, respectively: 85, 88 and 86% for CBR; 32, 51 and 46% for SBR; 24, 31 and 26% for NR. The inclusion of CBR significantly affected final weight of the fish, specific growth rate and protein retention rate, as well as the carcass composition values for dry matter, mineral matter, gross energy and ethereal extract. CBR presents better digestibility than the other tested residues and it can be used as a substitute for maize meal in quantities up to 11.62%, thus improving fish performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27265/21389,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Control of Meloidogyne incognita in tomato plants with highly diluted solutions of Thuya occidentalis and their effects on plant growth and defense metabolism,"This work aimed to control the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita in tomato Solanum lycopersicum L plants with high-diluted solutions of Thuya occidentalis, and to study its effects on growth and plant defense responses. The in vivo experiment was carried out over two years (2013 and 2014) at a climatized greenhouse, whilst the in vitro experiment was carried out in the laboratory. Eight treatments were used (6, 12, 24, 50, 100, 200 and 400CH (Hahnemannian centesimal) of T. occidentalis, with water as control treatment). For the in vivo assay, in 2013 plants were inoculated with about 4850 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2), while in 2014 they were inoculated with 5050 eggs and J2. The treatments were applied once a week, as 0.1% aqueous solutions onto the plant shoots, for 50 and 40 days respectively. For the in vitro experiment, the nematodes were directly exposed to the same 0.1% treatments. The treatments did not show nematostatic or nematicide effects in the in vitro assay, and had no influence on the hatching of the eggs. For the in vivo assay in 2013, T. occidentalis 100CH decreased the number of J2 present in the roots, whilst the dynamization of 200CH stimulated root development and increased the weight of the fruits of the first cluster. In 2014, 100CH decreased numbers of J2 in the soil. Some dynamization increased the plant’s defense enzyme activity, such as peroxidase (24, 50, 200 and 400CH), polyphenoloxidase (200CH), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (24 and 50CH). In this study, T. occidentalis 100CH showed potential for the control of M. incognita, whilst 24 and 200CH influenced the growth of plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24546/21393,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Energy coefficients of plant foods for broiler chickens at different ages,"In order to determine the apparent metabolizable energy (AME), the AME corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn), the apparent coefficients of metabolization (ACM) of gross energy and the ACM corrected for nitrogen balance (ACMn), an experiment was conducted to evaluate five different plant foods (corn, soybean meal, deactivated full-fat soybean, wheat bran and soybean oil) for broilers at different ages (1-8, 11-18, 21-28, 31-38 and 41-48 days). The method of total excreta collection was used, divided into five metabolism assays. The birds were housed in metabolic cages in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and five replicates per treatment, totaling 25 experimental units. The AME and AMEn values increased with the age of the birds for most foods, except soybean meal. The smaller AMC and AMCn of gross energy were obtained for wheat bran. There was adjustment of the equation to the linear response plateau model for the ACM of corn, soybean meal and deactivated full-fat soybean. The wheat bran and soybean oil were adjusted to the linear regression model. The equations show that the digestibility of energy tends to increase with age, except for soybean meal, which had higher metabolization with younger birds. We conclude that the age of the birds influences the determination of the metabolizable energy of feed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27034/21386,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Spatial dynamics: a new “milk corridor” in Paraná state, Brazil","Brazil is the fourth largest milk producer in the world, and Paraná state is the third largest producer in the country. Milk production plays an important socioeconomic role in Paraná state, and since the 1990s, institutional and market changes have influenced Paraná’s milk production. Given this context, this study searches to analyze the spatial dynamics of dairy activity in Paraná state. Specifically, it seeks to identify areas of greater expansion and contraction in dairy activities, and discuss possible structural and socioeconomic consequences in those regions. Data concerning productive and economic variables of the 399 municipalities in Paraná state were used to generate an indicator of dairy activity through Common Factor Analysis. Cluster analysis allowed the formation of groups, according to municipalities’ importance in Paraná’s dairy activity. We conclude that since the 1990s, there has been displacement of dairy activity from the northern regions and toward the south. Dairy activity has started to occupy areas otherwise considered ""agriculturally empty"" and socioeconomically vulnerable. Those areas, along with traditional production regions, comprise a new ""milk corridor"" in Paraná. This may generate a set of socioeconomic benefits in the region. Important structural changes may occur along the dairy chain, and both public and private policies should be set to assure dairy chain competitiveness in Paraná state.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27021/21406,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Nutritional value of sugarcane varieties in relation to nitrogen fertilization for the pre-Amazon Region of Brazil,"This study evaluated the nutritional value of sugarcane varieties in relation to nitrogen fertilization. The varieties studied were RB 863129, RB 867515, and RB 92579, and nitrogen fertilizer was applied at doses of 0, 60, 80, 120, and 140 kg N ha-1. The experiment was divided into two stages: i) Year I - plant cane, when the yield and nutritional quality of the three sugarcane varieties were evaluated; ii) Years II and III, when and the effect of nitrogen fertilization on the nutritional quality of the first and second ratoon crops of the same varieties was evaluated. In plant cane the yield (t ha-1) and DM (dry matter) and CP (crude protein) contents were higher for the RB 863129 variety. There was no difference between the varieties regarding their NDF (neutral detergent fiber) and ADF (acid detergent fiber) contents and IVDMD (in vitro dry matter digestibility). In the first and second ratoon crops, there was a difference between the varieties and fertilizer doses for the evaluated parameters, with the exception of the DM content and IVDMD, which were influenced by the varieties, doses of N, and cutting years. The RB 92579 variety showed the best yield of the two ratoon crops (131 t ha-1 of stems) and the best nutritional parameters (26% ADF, 41% NDF, 2.4% CP, and 69.4% IVDMD). The sugarcane yield and its nutritional quality can be influenced by the cutting year and nitrogen fertilization management system and by the variety type.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26988/21440,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effects of purified glycerin in balanced diets of chicken broilers treated from 22 to 42 days of age1,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of including purified glycerin in the diets of broilers from 22 to 42 days of age. Eighty Cobb 500® lineage broilers were distributed in a completely randomized design (CRD) to one of four treatment groups (0, 2, 4 and 6% of purified glycerin inclusion in feed) and five replicates of four birds. The birds were evaluated for performance (weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion); carcass yield; special cuts yield (thigh, drumstick and breast); muscle colour (L* = lightness, a* = redness, b* = yellowness); and crude protein, ether extract and moisture content of the breast muscle. Inclusion of purified glycerin in the diet did not affect (p > 0.05) any of the growth performance indicators, which demonstrated the technical feasibility of including up to 6% glycerin in the diet. Similarly, there was no effect on carcass yield; special-cut yields; muscle colour (L* = lightness, a* = redness, b* = yellowness); or crude protein, ether extract and moisture content of breast muscle. The inclusion of purified glycerin at up to 6% in the diet proved to be feasible in broilers treated from 22 to 42 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26903/21384,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Marandu palisade grass intercropped with densely spaced teak in silvopastoral system,"This study was conducted to evaluate two systems of production: integration between teak and forage (silvopastoral system) and forage only (monoculture). The forage species used was Marandu palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu). In January 2009, part of the pasture was desiccated and the teak (Tectona grandis) was implemented in a 3 × 4 m spacing arrangement, and at every five rows, a space between rows of 6 m was established, providing a population of 750 trees per hectare. Alongside the development of the trees, the Marandu palisade grass pasture was reestablished. In February 2015, the animals were removed from the experimental area and, in March, the pasture degradation, the density and the mass of tillers was assessed. The following variables were evaluated: sward height; forage mass, percentage of leaf blade, stem+sheath and senescent material; leaf blade:stem+sheath ratio; and live:dead material ratio. The experimental design was completely randomized, with 12 replicates. Treatments consisted of two systems (silvopastoral and monoculture). The total forage accumulation was higher in the monoculture system. The sward height and the percentage of stem+sheath were higher in the integrated system, while the percentage of leaf blade and the leaf blade:stem+sheath ratio were higher in the system exclusively with forage. In conclusion, Marandu palisade grass tolerates shading in a high density spacing silvopastoral system, but the degradation process is more intense compared to grass in monoculture, and the use of Marandu palisade grass in silvopastoral systems changes the forage mass and the structure of the produced forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26893/21383,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Fiber composition and degradability of cold season green forage and pre-dried silage harvested at pre-flowering,"This study aimed to evaluate the contents of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, as well as the rates of dry matter degradability in forage and pre-dried silage of different winter cereals harvested at pre-flowering. The experiment was conducted by the Animal Production Center (NUPRAN), Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, State University of Midwest (UNICENTRO). It is located in Guarapuava – PR, Brazil. The study was part of the Master's Degree in Crop Production. As experimental materials, we used black oat (Avena strigosa) cv. EMB 139 and cv. IAPAR 61; white oat (Avena sativa) cv. IPR and 126 hp. URS Taura; barley (Hordeum vulgare) cv. BRS Brau and cv. BRS Cauê; wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. BRS Umbu and cv. BRS Tarumã; rye (Secale cereale) cv. Temprano and cv. BRS Serrano; and triticale (X Triticosecale) cv. IPR and 111 hp. BRS Saturn. Dry matter degradability was measured by an in situ technique, arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications (animal), subdivided in subplots. Treatments were the plots and subplots digestion times. The incubation times were 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. To that end, we used two 24-month rumen fistulated steers with 350 kg average weight. A similarity was observed in the results of both forage and pre-dried silage degradability, displaying the same trends. Barley cv. BRS Brau had the highest hemicellulose content in its composition; however, IPR 111 triticale was showed the highest degradability potential, both for green forage and pre-dried silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26817/21380,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,In vitro digestibility and nutritional characterization of distillers dried grains with solubles according to the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System,"We evaluated the fractions of protein and carbohydrates in distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn grain (CG), soybean meal (SM), and corn silage (CS), as well as the in vitro digestibility (IVD) of DDGS, CG, SM, CS, rations containing 0.0, 8.0, 16.0, and 24.0% DDGS, and in vitro fermentation parameters after 24 h of incubation. DDGS were obtained following microbial fermentation for ethanol production from a sugar and alcohol distillery located in the state of Mato Grosso - Brazil. The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) was used to determine the protein and carbohydrate fractions of experimental diets. For the in vitro nutrient digestion assay using the experimental foods and experimental diets, two sheep with an average body weight of 26 kg were used as inoculum donors. The in vitro digestibility of food and feed was assayed in three replicates. Fraction A of DDGS CP was 88, 71, and 37% lower in relation to fraction A of SM, CG, and CS, respectively. Fraction B2 of DDGS protein contained 21% CP, which represents 78.84% of DDGS protein in fraction B2, and is higher than the SM, which was 70.44%. The B3 fraction of CP, which is partly released during ruminal fermentation, was 18% lower for SM compared to DDGS, and is expressed in %CP. For carbohydrate fractionation, the DDGS presented 8.64% for the A + B1 fraction on a DM basis, which was 62, 86, and 74% lower compared to those obtained for SM, CG. and CS, respectively. The hemicellulose and cellulose contents of DDGS were higher than those of SM, as verified in fraction B2, with a value of 46.92%, expressed in DM. The in vitro digestibility coefficients (IVDC) of the DDGS nutrients did not differ (p > 0.05) in relation to those of the other experimental foods. The inclusion of DDGS in rations formulated for sheep did not change (p > 0.05) the IVDC of DM, OM, CP. NDF, or ADF, with mean values of 70.93, 70.64, 59.58, 52.83, and 43.40%, respectively. Therefore, DDGS comprise a protein-rich food containing more than 70% CP in fraction B2, with a large amount of carbohydrates bound to the cell wall. In addition, DDGS possess a similar digestibility coefficient to corn grain and soybean meal; however, up to 24% can be included in feed formulations for ruminants without changing the in vitro digestibility coefficient of nutrients.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26727/21379,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Fatty acid profile and lambs’ meat quality fed with different levels of crude glycerin replacing corn,"This study aimed to evaluate the Texel lambs’ meat quality fed with increasing levels of crude glycerin (0, 7, 14, and 21% of dry matter) in the diet. Thirthy-two-two non-castrated male Texel lambs were used, with initial weight of 15.9 ± 4.1 kg, using a completely randomized design with four treatments and eight repetitions, per treatment. Upon reaching the average weight of 35 kg, the animals were slaughtered. The meat chemical composition was similar among treatments (P>0.05) and total lipids and crude protein presented averages of 3.47 and 20.05 g 100g -1, respectively. No changes in pH, marbling, color, and water loss under pressure were observed. The shear force did not change among treatments and the texture can be considered soft, with average values of 5.48 kgf. There was a linear (P0.05) were observed for the attributes flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptance among treatments. Fatty acids in higher proportions in the meat lamb were to C18:1n-9 (1298.90 mg 100g-1), C16:0 (709.07 mg 100g-1) and C18:0 (433.30 mg 100g-1), with percentages of 42.72, 23.07 and 14.35%, respectively. Significant difference according to the glycerin level in the diet was observed only for the margaric acid (C17:0) with an increasing linear effect, reaching 58.95 mg 100g-1 muscle to the group with 21% crude glycerin, corresponding to 1.77% of total fatty acids. The other fatty acids did not change, and provided a satisfactory result for conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), totaling about 6.1 mg 100 g-1 muscle, corresponding to 0.21% of total lipids. The use of glycerin in the diet for finishing lambs does not alter the characteristics of the meat, maintaining the product quality for consumption.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26824/21381,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Regional composition of carcass and tissue composition of cuts from lambs slaughtered with different subcutaneous fat thicknesses,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) on the regional composition of the carcass, the tissue composition of cuts, and the leg muscularity index of Santa Inês lambs. This experiment involved 24 uncastrated male lambs at approximately 100 days of age and at an average live weight of 22.70 ± 3.75 kg that were kept in the feedlot, where they received a complete pelleted diet formulated to provide a daily gain of 0.30 kg. The animals were slaughtered as they reached the pre-defined SFT of 2.00, 3.00, and 4.00 mm, evaluated by ultrasonography. Lambs slaughtered with 4.00 mm SFT had a heavier shoulder (1.80 kg) and leg (2.99 kg), differing from those slaughtered with 2.00 mm. No significant differences were observed (P > 0.05) between the treatments for the percentages of muscle in the cuts, which averaged 48.38% for the neck, 58.71% for the shoulder, 43.87% for the ribs, 53.56% for the loin, and 64.52% for the leg. Lambs slaughtered with 4.00 and 3.00 mm SFT differed from those slaughtered with 2.00 mm SFT for the percentage of total fat in the shoulder, which averaged 20.10, 19.02, and 15.79%, respectively. The animals slaughtered with 2.00 mm of fat exhibited the highest percentage of bone in the loin (20.23%). Leg muscularity was lower (0.34) in those slaughtered with 2.00 mm of subcutaneous fat. Slaughtering Santa Inês lambs with different subcutaneous fat thicknesses yields different regional compositions of the carcass, tissue compositions of cuts, and leg muscularity indices. It is recommended to slaughter Santa Inês lambs when they reach a subcutaneous fat thickness of 3.00 mm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26675/21378,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Water with different salinity levels for lactating goats,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of supplying water with varying salinity levels to dairy goats on nutrient intake, apparent nutrient digestibility, and milk yield. The experiment lasted 65 days and involved 24 crossbred goats with mean body weight of 38±4 kg, which were randomly allotted. It was set in a completely randomized design with four treatments consisting of 640, 3188, 5740 and 8326 mg L?1 total dissolved solids (TDS) in the drinking water. The results showed that water salinity levels had no effect on the intake of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, ether extract, total carbohydrates, non-fibrous carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, metabolizable energy, digestible energy, or apparent nutrient digestibility. Water intake was influenced by the salinity, increasing as the salt level was increased. Moreover, the varying salinity had no significant effect on milk yield. Drinking water containing up to 8326 mg L?1 TDS provided no interference with the intake and nutrient digestibility of lactating goats in the feedlot. However, increasing the water salinity affects animal intake without any changes in milk yield. Therefore, this type of water can be used for crossbred goats at 30 days in milk, for up to 65 days in the feedlot.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26863/21382,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Fruit agribusiness waste as an additive in elephant grass silage,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential use of fruticulture waste as an additive in elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) cultivar Napier silage at different densities, defining the effect of fermentative quality, microbiological characteristics and bromatological composition. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, comprising a control, banana waste (BW), mango waste (MW), and passion fruit waste (PFW) at three densities (400, 500 and 600 kg green matter [GM] m-3). The effect of ensiling density was greatest in the exclusively elephant grass silage, where a compaction of 600 kg GM m-3 contributed to improvements in fermentation and microbiological processes. The addition of banana waste to the elephant grass silage promoted improvements only in bromatological composition, raising the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) content and reducing fiber components (neutral detergent fiber [NDFap] and acid detergent fiber [ADFap] corrected for ash and protein), but the addition of banana waste did not favor the fermentative or microbiological processes. The addition of passion fruit and mango by-products promoted increased DM and favored the fermentative, microbiological, and bromatological silage processes, regardless of density.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26499/21376,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of shed rooftype and babassu pie on the productive characteristics of meat quails,"We aimed to evaluate the effects of shed roof(SR) typeand the inclusion of babassu pie (BP) in rations on the productive characteristics ofmeat quailsfrom days 14 to 28 and days14 to 40. We studied 896 meatquails. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 4x4 factorial arrangement, using four types of shedroofs (fiber cement, ceramic, straw, and painted fiber cement) and four rations (with 0, 5, 10, and 15% inclusion of babassu pie). The performance variables evaluated from 14 to 28 and 14 to 40 days included food intake (FI, g/bird), mean weight gain (WG, g/bird), food conversion (FC, g/g), mean live weight on day 28 (MW28, g/bird), mean live weight on day 40 (MW40, g/bird), and energy efficiency (EF; g Mcal). After slautherthe birds on day 40, we measured the carcass weight (CW) and the carcass yield (CY, %), obtained for the breast (BY), legs (LGY), and wings (WINGY). We also obtained the relative weight of the heart (HRW), liver (LRW), gizzard (GRW), and intestine (IRW). To compare the economic efficiency between the experimental rations, we analyzed the cost of ration per kg of carcass (CC) and determined the gross margin (GM). Between day 14 and day 28, we found that the use of SR influenced the FI28, WG28, and the MW28 of the quails (p < 0.05). BP did not affect FI28 (p > 0.05), but it linearly improved WG28, FC28, MW28, and EF28. Between days 14 and 40, we found that SR influenced the WG40, FC40, MW40, and EF40 of the quails (p < 0.05) and that a BP increased the FI40, WG40, and MW40 in a quadratic manner. SR and BP did not affect the CW, BY, WINGY, LGY, HRW, LRW,or IRW. However, BP influenced MGRW, which increased linearly with the inclusion of BP. We concluded that a ceramic roof provides better environmental conditions than do other shed roofs. The inclusion of BP improved the performance characteristics, and it was technically feasible to include up to 15% BP in the rations of meat quails. Based on the current cost analysis, however, the inclusion of BP is economically unfeasible.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26667/21377,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of ovarian tissue storage in Morus nigra extract on the morphology and DNA fragmentation of ovine preantral follicles,"This study demonstrated the effect of Morus nigra leaf extract during ovine ovarian tissue transportation on the survival and apoptosis of preantral follicles in vitro. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the fingerprint chromatogram of the crude ethanolic extract. Four pairs of ovaries from four sheep were collected. The ovarian cortex was fragmented and one fragment was fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde and processed for histological and TUNEL analysis (fresh control). The other fragments were placed in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM – control medium) or M. nigra extract (0.025; 0.05 or 0.1 mg/mL) and stored (simulating transport) at 4ºC for 6, 12 or 24 h. Preserved fragments (6 h) were also destined to histological and TUNEL analysis. HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of antioxidant compounds (rutin, isoquercetin e kaempferitrin) in the extract. There was a decrease (P < 0.05) in the percentage of morphologically normal preantral follicles after preservation in all treatments compared to the fresh control. The percentage of normal preantral follicles after preservation in M. nigra at 0.05 mg/mL for 6 h was higher (P < 0.05) than in MEM or 0.025 mg/mL M. nigra and similar (P > 0.05) to 0.1 mg/mL of the extract. Apoptosis increased (P < 0.05) after conservation for 6 h in all treatments compared to the fresh control. Moreover, TUNEL positive cells decreased (P < 0.05) after preservation in 0.05 or 0.1 mg/mL M. nigra compared to MEM or 0.025 mg/mL M. nigra. In conclusion, 0.05 mg/mL M. nigra extract can be used as a preservation medium for ovine ovarian tissue at 4°C for up to 6 h.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27285/21375,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,In vitro action of Mimosa caesalpinifolia ketone extract on Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis,"This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic activity of Mimosa caesalpinifolia (sabiá) ketone extract, which is rich in condensed tannins (CT), on Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. The leaves and stems of M. caesalpinifolia were collected, dried in the shade, and ground to a dry powder from which ketone extracts were obtained for in vitro assays. The extracts were diluted in 5% acetone and PBS to concentrations in the range 0.25-2.80 mg mL-¹ and the inhibition of egg hatchability was assayed. Feces collected from goats naturally infected with H. contortus (55%) and T. colubriformis (45%) were macerated and the helminth eggs were collected to conduct in vitro egg hatchability tests. Nematode larvae collected from the feces were used for a larval exsheathment inhibition assay of M. caesalpinifolia leaf and M. caesalpinifolia leaf and stem ketone extracts at concentrations of 0.6 and 1.2 mg mL-¹; three replicates were performed for each concentration. PBS was used as a negative control. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) was added to the extracts to assess the effect of phenolic compounds on anthelmintic activity. An inhibitory effect of 80.7% and 82.3% was observed on hatchability after treatment with 1.0 and 2.0 mg mL-¹ M. caesalpinifolia leaf ketone extract, respectively. An inhibition rate lower than 75% was observed for 1.0 mg mL-¹ M. caesalpinifolia leaf and stem ketone extract. The M. caesalpinifolia leaf ketone extract larval exsheathment assay resulted in inhibition of 97.3% and 99.8% at concentrations of 0.6 and 1.2 mg mL-¹, respectively. For the leaf and stem ketone extract, the larval exsheathment inhibition was 94.3% at 1.2 mg mL-¹. The leaf and leaf and stem extracts showed no inhibitory effects on larval exsheathment after the addition of PVPP. These results showed that cuticular loss was related to the action of the phenolic compounds in the M. caesalpinifolia extracts. M. caesalpinifolia leaf ketone extract inhibited egg hatchability, but the leaf and stem extract showed lower efficiency, which indicated a greater abundance of active compounds in the leaves. The M. caesalpinifolia ketone extracts were effective in the inhibition of larval exsheathment at the highest concentration tested. Based on these results, in vivo studies should be performed to demonstrate the anthelmintic activity of this plant in goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/27118/21439,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Chenopodium ambrosioides L. essential oil and ethanol extract on control of canine Ancylostoma spp.,"The use of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. has shown to be promising in the management of gastrointestinal nematodes. The objective of this study was to quantitate the yield and characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil of C. ambrosioides, as well as to evaluate the in vitro effect of the ethanolic extract and the essential oil in L3 of Ancylostoma spp. and the in vivo effect(s) of the essential oil in dogs. The effects of the ethanol extract and essential oil on Ancylostoma spp. were evaluated in vitro by exposing larvae to the extract at concentrations ranging from 0.005 g mL-1 to 0.2 g mL-1 and to essential oil at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 ?L mL-1. For the in vivo test, 26 healthy dogs, naturally infected by Ancylostoma spp., were divided into three groups: F1 - cookies were administered without active principle; F2 - herbal cookies containing 37.5 ?L g-1 essential oil of C. ambrosioides L.; F3 - cookies plus a commercial formulation containing febantel, pyrantel, praziquantel, and ivermectin. Complete blood counts and serum biochemistry for AST, ALT, AF, urea, creatinine, total protein, and albumin were performed. The yield of the essential oil was 0.3% m v-1, and its major components included ?-terpinene (1.24%), p-cymene (4.83%), and ascaridol Z (87%) and E (5.04%) isomers. The concentrations of C. ambrosioides L. ethanol extract used were ineffective against Ancylostoma spp. larvae. The essential oil at a concentration of 150 ?L mL-1 was effective against L3 larvae. In the in vivo study in dogs, the herbal cookies containing C. ambrosioides L essential oil reduced the number of eggs per gram of feces.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26470/21372,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Epidemiological characterization and risk factors associated with leptospirosis and brucellosis in small ruminants sold at animal fair in the Sertão Region of Pernambuco State, a semiarid Region of Northeastern Brazil","The transit of infected animals may be a route for the introduction and dispersal of diseases, which necessitates protocols for the controlled entry of infected animals into herds. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-Leptospira and anti-Brucella ovis antibodies in small ruminants sold at an animal fair in the Sertão region of the Pernambuco State, Northeastern Brazil, and to identify the possible risk factors associated with seropositivity. Serum samples were collected from 233 goats and 119 sheep, belonging to twelve different owners from November 2014 to June 2015. Diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection was established using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); for B. ovis infection, the agar gel immuno-diffusion (AGID) test was conducted. A total of 16/233 (6.87%; 95% CI = 4.27% – 10.83%) goats and 16/119 (13.45%; 95% CI = 8.67% – 21.24%) sheep were identified as seropositive for Leptospira spp. The most frequent serotype was Icterohaemorrhagiae. In goats, intensive management system (odds ratio = 15.8; p < 0.001) and consorted rearing of equines and goats (odds ratio = 7.3; p = 0.005) were identified as risk factors. There were no risk factors identified for sheep. Seven (5.88%; 95% CI = 2.88% – 11.65%) sheep were seropositive for B. ovis, and the intensive management system was identified as the risk factor (odds ratio = 11.5; p = 0.005). This suggests that Leptospira spp. and B. ovis infections occur in small ruminants commercialized in the Sertão region of the Pernambuco State. Thus, improvements to the sanitary conditions of the facilities and the control of synanthropic rodents are recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26325/21371,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Quality of milk used in informal artisanal production of coalho and butter cheeses,"Artisanal cheeses such as coalho and butter participate in the socio-cultural identity of people and deserve recognition. Like many artisanal cheeses, it is common to produce coalho and butter cheeses from raw milk. For this reason, it is essential that the raw material from dairies is of good quality to minimize risks to consumers. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of milk in artisanal cheese factories in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Fifty samples were collected from areas that stand out in dairy production in the state. These samples underwent microbiological and physical–chemical analysis, as well as antibiotic residue and fraud searches. Viable strict and facultative mesophilic bacteria were surveyed, in addition to total and thermotolerant coliforms, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus; titratable acidity in Dornic degrees, density, cryoscopy, stability to alizarol, and percentages of protein, lactose, and fat contents were also measured, and tests for residues and recurrent fraud in milk were conducted. In general, all samples exceeded the limit established by law for mesophilic bacteria counting; Salmonella sp. was found in one sample. Given this contamination, the acidity of 76% of the samples was higher than allowed by the legislation. Regarding fat and protein parameters, 14% and 10% of the samples were below the required values by the legislation, respectively. Furthermore, there is suspicion of fraud by adding water in 24% of samples. Chlorides were found in 16% and antimicrobial residues in 46% of samples. Therefore, the quality of the milk used in informal artisanal cheese making in the state of Rio Grande do Norte is poor and may pose a risk to consumers, with the loss of quality of coalho and butter cheeses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26744/21438,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Technical and economic indices that determine the profitability of milk production systems participating in the “Full Bucket” program,"This study assesses the relationships among net margin (ML), profitability (LUC), and return (RENT), as well as several technical and economic indices that determine the ML, LUC and RENT land-use change, and economic return of milk production systems. We estimate and analyze the property-size, zootechnical, and economic indices of 20 milk production systems located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2011. We also conduct a descriptive analysis of the variables studied, as well as a multiple linear regression analysis among the estimated indices (independent variables) and the net margin, profitability, and return (dependent variables). The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0. The items that most influenced net margin were milk production by labor, total revenue, energy and protein commercial concentrates, and the ratio of labor costs to total operating costs. Then, profitability was most influenced by animal productivity per day, fixed value by lactation matrix (value immobilized in the activity divided by the number of lactating matrices), milk revenue, and the representativeness of energy concentrates. Economic returns were most influenced by the number of males available for sale, as well as by animal productivity per day and the value of assets on land per hectare. These findings show that management and technological efforts are required to reduce production costs. In addition, animal productivity needs to be increased because it is has the highest positive relationship with profitability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25445/21368,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Occurrence and molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium sp. in sheep,"Considered a zoonosis of utmost importance, cryptosporidiosis has a worldwide distribution and can infect mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. It is caused by a highly resistant protozoan present in the environment and can cause death in immunosuppressed individuals and pups, as well as in farm animals such as cattle and sheep, generating losses. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in sheep feces from the farms of Western Paraná, which have different management styles, and compare the results with their respective management methods. One hundred and forty-four stool samples were collected (69 from Property 1 and 75 from Property 2) and analyzed using a fecal smear on slides after staining by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method. Samples tested positive by this method were subjected to nested PCR and the products obtained were sent for sequencing to determine the species. While 82.60% of the samples from Property 1 were tested positive, only 36% of the samples from Property 2 were tested positive. On analyzing the sequencing data, it was observed that the Cryptosporidium species of samples from Property 1 showed high similarity to Cryptosporidium xiaoi and those from Property 2, to Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. The reason for divergence in results can be attributed to differences in management systems adopted by each property, thus showing the importance of detecting carrier animals, as they can contaminate the environment, especially the water sources, and spread the disease to humans and other animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25837/21369,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Ex vivo biomechanical analysis of two methods of osteosynthesis in canine mandibular fractures,"Mandibular fractures represent an orthopedic challenge in veterinary medicine consideringthe large number of fixation methods that could be used depending on the location and manner in which the fracture occurs. Bone plates are a method of internal fixation that allows the correction of single or bilateral fractures, simple or comminuted; which appropriate material and technical knowledge for their use. Recent studies have demonstrated the superior strength that the locked plates present in relation to the neutralization plates, especially when used in flat bones or with lower bone density. The present study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical strength of neutralization plates and locked plates in oblique mandibular fractures in dogs. Sixteen hemimandibles from mesocephalic dogs were selected, weighing between 15 and 25 kg, without mandibular pathological alterations. Unfavorable fractures were performed between the 2nd and 3rd premolar teeth. The hemimandibles were allocated to two groups and stabilized with neutralization (Group 1) and locked (Group 2) plates. Both groups were subjected to the vertical compression test using the EMIC DL500 machine, sought to note the difference of maximum resistance between the implants. The statistical analysis used was the t-test and showed no difference (P = 0.135) between the strength of the group receiving neutralization plates (21.08±9.766kgf) and the group that received locked plates (25.96±7.029kgf). From the point of view of resistance to vertical compression, the neutralized and locked plates have the same biomechanical strength.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26324/21370,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Detection of Brucella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk and cheese of uninspected production in the metropolitan area of São Paulo","Foodborne diseases are a major public health issue but their overall incidence is underestimated due to insufficient report. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of Brucella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk and cheese of uninspected production obtained from cattle bred on the polluted banks of the Tietê River. Generally, milk from these animals is used to prepare fresh cheese, which is then commercialized by the producers themselves or in local markets. We analyzed 81 samples consisting of 38 samples of cheeses, 15 samples of raw milk and 28 samples of water collected from the Tietê River. These samples were evaluated for the presence of the three pathogens using bacteriological methods and the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with primers specific for each bacterial genus. In the bacteriological examination, all samples were negative for Brucella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. In the PCR test, Brucella spp. was detected in 5/38 (13.16%) cheese samples. Campylobacter spp. was present in 18/38 (47.37%) cheese samples, 1/15 (6.66%) raw milk samples and in 12/28 (42.86%) water samples. Listeria monocytogenes was not detected by PCR. The detection of Brucella spp. DNA in cheese and Campylobacter spp. DNA in cheese, milk and water may reflect inadequate animal sanitary management and deficiencies in good manufacturing practices. The presence of these pathogens in the food and water may pose a threat to the health of the consumer and increase the incidence of zoonosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25341/21367,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Evaluation of biofilm formation by bacterial strains isolated from milking equipment and milk samples from cows with mastitis,"The presence of biofilm-forming bacteria from the mammary gland of dairy cows adhered to equipment in the milking environment represents one of the major causes of bacterial resistance during mastitis treatment. The aim of this study was to identify strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli in milk samples from cows with mastitis, as well as in the expansion tank and milking set liners. We aimed to quantify the extracellular proteins and polysaccharides in the biofilm produced by each strain. A total of 294 samples were collected from a dairy farm in the municipality of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais. To identify the S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli isolates responsible for biofilm production, we tested the phenotype using the Congo red agar (CRA) and microplate adhesion tests. Protein quantification was performed with a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (BCA kit), and polysaccharides were quantified by the phenol sulfuric acid method. We identified eight strains of S. aureus, one strain of S. epidermidis and 11 strains of E. coli responsible for biofilm production, all of which showed a higher concentration of polysaccharides than proteins in the matrix. Escherichia coli was considered the most prevalent bacterium among the samples, and S. aureus was determined to be the largest biofilm producer. The results of the CRA and microplate adhesion tests were similar in regard to identification of the biofilm-producing strains according to their phenotype and matrix composition. The classification of S. aureus strains as major biofilm producers is of great concern for producers, as such bacteria are considered one of the predominant contagious etiological agents that cause bovine mastitis. In addition, our observation that E. coli and S. epidermidis can produce biofilms highlights the need to reassess prophylactic measures to avoid the adhesion of biofilm-producing bacteria.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24648/21366,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Epidemiological characterization and risk factors associated with lentiviral infection of small ruminants at animal fairs in the semiarid Sertão region of Pernambuco, Brazilian semiarid","Animal agglomerations at commercial events such as trade fairs represent an important facilitator in infectious disease transmission. Thus, it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases in small ruminants. The objective of this study was to examine lentiviral presence in goats and sheep traded at the animal fair of Tabira city (Sertão region of Pernambuco) and identify possible risk factors associated with infection. We collected serum samples from 233 crossbred goats and 119 crossbred sheep, belonging to 12 breeders, at the Tabira livestock fair from November 2014 to June 2015. An epidemiological questionnaire was used to analyze the risk factors. Agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and western blotting (WB) were performed to diagnose small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection. In the AGID test, we used maedi-visna virus (MVV) antigens for sheep and caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (strain Cork) (CAEV-Co) antigen for goats. The WB analysis used CAEV-Co antigen for both species. Variables from the questionnaire were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistics. One seropositive goat but no sheep was identified via AGID. According to the WB results, 15/233 goats (6.44%; CI95% = 3.94 - 10.35%) and 8/119 sheep (6.72%; CI95% = 3.45 - 12.71%) were seropositive, totaling 23/352 reactive animals (6.53%; CI95% = 4.39 - 9.61%) from 12 herds. Annual vermifugation of the animals was a significant risk factor (odds ratio = 5.9; CI95% = 1.7-19.8; p = 0.04) for disease in goats, but no variables associated with infection risks were identified in sheep. We concluded that SRLV was present in goats and sheep at the animal fair. Western blots were more sensitive than AGID for SRLV diagnosis. Practices aiming to improve sanitary management may reduce the risk of infection in goats. All studied herds included animals identified as seropositive for SRLV. Therefore, we recommend adopting measures that increase disease diagnosis while intensifying traffic control and surveillance of animal agglomerations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24506/21365,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Physical characteristics of baru tree fruit aimed at kernel extraction,"The baru tree fruit has a sustainable economical potential. However, the shelling process to release the whole kernel, the most valued part of the fruit, is still performed in a rather inefficient way. The objective of this investigation was to determine the physical-mechanical properties of the fruit to understand its behavior during shelling. Fruit and nut were characterized by unit mass, dimensions, volume and bulk, and real densities. Compression tests up to endocarp disruption were performed to determine maximum force, corresponding deformation, and deformation energy. X-ray tomography was used to identify potential nut internal dimension changes, affected by the treatments. Whole fruits and nuts showed average unit mass values of 28.20 ± 0.99 g and 16.52 ± 1.67 g, respectively. Their average dimensions, such as length, width, and thickness were 52.40 ± 4.48 mm, 38.31 ± 4.05 mm, and 28.64 ± 3.67 mm, and 50.78 ± 5.57 mm, 34.65 ± 5.14 mm, and 21.36 ± 2.86 mm, respectively. Average bulk and real densities values were 519.33 ± 49.63 kg/m3 and 918.87 ± 77.77 kg/m3, and 517.14 ± 41.88 kg/m3 and 1072.00 ± 187.01 kg/m3, respectively. Considering all treatments, the average rupture force ranged between 7926.7 and 9284.4 N, with corresponding widthwise specific deformation of 5.1% and 6.6%, to release 100% whole kernels of the tested nuts. Up to maximum force, deformation energy values ranged between 6.55 and 9.26J. There was no evidence of treatments’ effect on the internal dimension. Based on its mechanical behavior, showing that it is possible to open the endocarp and release the whole kernel, it was concluded that the baru nut has mechanized shelling potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26587/21364,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Buffalo mozzarella chemical composition and authenticity assessment by electrophoretic profiling,"Buffalo milk mozzarella is often adulterated by the addition of cow’s milk. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of buffalo milk mozzarella by using electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to detect the addition of cow’s milk. Reference cheeses were produced exclusively from combinations of buffalo and cow milk, and labeled reference treatment buffalo or cow (RTB and RTC, respectively). Standardized cheeses were made by combining buffalo milk and 2.5%, 5.0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% cow’s milk. A total of 9 cheese formulations were produced and either frozen immediately (time 0) or after 20 days (time 20). Eighteen commercial samples of buffalo mozzarella were sampled between 0–20 days of production. The chemical composition (moisture, ash, fat in dry matter, protein, total solids and defatted dry extract) and physicochemical characteristics (acidity) of the cheeses were evaluated. Proteins and water-soluble peptides (WSP) extracted from RTB, RTC and from the commercial samples, and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. It was not possible to detect the inclusion of cow’s milk by the cheeses’ chemical and physicochemical properties. However, the separation and detection of peptide and protein fractions of the cheese was possible by electrophoresis. The results of the electrophoretic analysis suggest that 28% of the commercial samples considered here had evidence of the addition of cow’s milk. The methodology described here is important to identify occurrences of fraud in buffalo mozzarella production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25533/21362,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Fractions of soil organic matter in the vineyards of altitude regions in Santa Catarina,"The implementation of agricultural systems such as viticulture can quantitatively and qualitatively affect the contents of soil organic matter (SOM). These changes may modify the edaphic features of the soil as well as the soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical and physical fraction of SOMand to analyze changes in the carbon stock and C management index in areas of implanted vineyards in altitude regions of Santa Catarina. Four regions were selected: Region I (Urubici); Region II (San Joaquim); Region III (Campos Novos) and Region IV (Água Doce). In each region, we selected vineyards implanted between 2001 and 2005 as well as surrounding forested areas. Disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected from the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm layers of the soil. Samples were prepared in the laboratory to obtain air-dried soft soil, which was then used for the analysis of several parameters, namely total organic carbon (TOC), carbon stock,and chemical fractionation of the soil. The chemical fractionation was then used to determine carbon content in the fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), humic acid fraction (C-HAF), and humin fraction (C-HUM). We also analyzed particle size, quantified the levels of particulate carbon (COp) and carbon associated with clay and silt (COam), and calculated the carbon management index (CMI). We evaluated normality and homogeneity for all data. The results were evaluated with an analysis of variance and subsequent F-test. Mean values were compared using a 5% Student’s t-test and subsequently submitted to a Tukey’s test. The highest TOC levels were observed in Region II in the 0-5 cm layer in both vineyard and forested areas. Vineyard areas exhibited lower values of TOC, Cop, and COam compared to forested areas indicating that the management adopted in these areas contributed to the reduction of these fractions. Forested areas exhibited a higher proportion of Cop compared to vineyard areas. The humin fraction represented the largest portion of the TOC and comprised the highest values in both forested and vineyard areas. The carbon management index indicated a low contribution of vineyard areas or a reduction in carbon storage in their soils.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26555/21358,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Physical and chemical characterization and quantification of bioactive compounds in berries and berry jams,"Brazil is the third largest producer of fresh fruits in the world. Among fruits, berries such as strawberry, blueberry and blackberry can be highlighted for the benefits they provide to the body, owing to their presence of bioactive compound content. The phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, are examples of bioactive compounds that mainly function in the body as antioxidants. However, the processing steps that lead to the generation of derivatives from these fruits, are damaging to these compounds, often leading to their loss. Thus, the aim of this study was to physically and chemically characterize fresh berries (strawberry, blueberry and blackberry) and their jams, and also to quantify and to evaluate the antioxidant activity of bioactive compounds in berries and their jams. The following parameters were analyzed: moisture, ash, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, and color. The levels of total phenolic compounds, total anthocyanins, ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity were measured. We concluded that there were significant differences in the chemical composition of berries and jams. There was also a significant loss of bioactive compounds due to processing, nevertheless these jams remain good sources of bioactive compounds, and are still considered important to promote some favorable health effects.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26576/21363,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Beet seed priming with growth regulators,"Seed priming is a technique used to induce metabolic germination processes. Use of growth regulators in seed priming may facilitate increments in physiological processes during seed germination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of priming and growth regulators on beet seed germination. The treatments were cultivar type (Early Wonder, Itapuã and Maravilha) and seed priming technique, which included a control (unconditioned seed) standard hydropriming (water) and a conditioning with salicylic, gibberellic and ascorbic acids, respectively. The treatments were defined by initially testing 0, 1, 2 and 4 mM ascorbic, gibberellic and salicylic acids. Before seed priming, imbibition seed curves were established to determine the optimal conditioning time. After conditioning, the germination, rate of germination, seedling length and seedling dry weight were evaluated. First, the appropriate dosage for conditioning was determined by using a completely randomized experimental design, with four replications per cultivar. Then, a 3 x 5 (cultivar x conditioning technique) factorial design was adopted. Whenever the results were significant by variance analysis, regression analysis was performed. Finally, Tukey’s test was used to compare the means at P=0.05. Beet seed priming alters the potential of germination and is influenced by the cultivar and conditioning technique. Pretreatment with 1?2 mM ascorbic, gibberellic or salicylic acids, respectively, promotes beet seed germination, whereas at 1?3 mM, the growth of roots and shoots of beet seedlings is promoted. The most effective techniques to promote germination and growth of sugar beet seedlings were priming with water, salicylic acid or gibberellic acid.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26513/21403,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Soil, water, nutrients and soil organic matter losses by water erosion as a function of soil management in the Posses sub-watershed, Extrema, Minas Gerais, Brazil","Knowledge of the quantity and quality of the material lost by soil erosion due to soil management is a basic need to identify land management zones in catchments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil management on the quantity and quality of soil material lost by erosion in the Posses sub-watershed, Municipality of Extrema, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Water and sediments lost by natural rainfall erosion were sampled from erosion plots located on a Red-Yellow Argisol (PVA) under the following systems: bare soil, subsistence farming (maize/beans/pumpkin/jack-beans/fallow), degraded pasture, well-managed pasture, and reforestation set up in 2013; and in a Litholic Neosol (RL): reforestation set up in 2008, bare soil, and native forest. Ca, Mg, K, P, N and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were determined in sediment and soil samples (at 0-5 cm depth) for the determination of the runoff enrichment ratios. Management influences soil losses more so than water losses. Minor losses were found in reforestation set up in 2013 (soil); in well-managed pasture (water); and in reforestations (nutrients and SOM). These losses tend to stability with time. The general sequence of nutrient losses was N > Ca > Mg > K > P in PVA; and N > Ca > K > Mg > P in RL. Loss rates of SOM and N followed the order: bare soil > subsistence farming > degraded pasture > well-managed pasture > reforestation, in PVA; and bare soil > native forest > reforestation, in RL. Reforestation and well-management pasture are effective conservation strategies in order to lower the erosion process in the Posses sub-watershed. Soil losses, as well as nutrients and organic matter losses were more influenced by soil management than water losses. The safeguarding native forest under Litholic Neosol is essential to the conservation of this pedoenvironment, especially in steep slopes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26562/21437,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, light organic matter, and remaining phosphorus under a crop-livestock integration system","Crop-livestock integration (CLI) is a management system that has been developed for a variety of soil and climatic conditions, which combined with the no-tillage system (NTS), has many variations in Brazil, particularly regarding grazing intensity. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of different grazing intensities and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops on carbon (Cst) and nitrogen (Nst) stocks, light organic matter (LOM), root content of the LOM (RLOM), and remaining phosphorus (Prem) in an Oxisol under CLI. The treatments consisted of three different heights (0.25 m [P25], 0.35 m [P35], and 0.45 m [P45]) of pasture grown in a CLI system. Two control areas, an area without grazing (AWG) and a native vegetation area of the Cerrado biome (NCA), which were adjacent to the experimental area, were compared with the cultivated areas. Soil samples were collected from 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m beneath each area in a completely randomized design with six replications. Soil characteristics were evaluated in the post-pasture cycle period (PP) and the post-soybean crop period (PC), which coincided with the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The NCA had more LOM in the 0.00-0.05 m layer during the PC and the 0.05-0.10 m layer during both the PP and the PC, C in the LOM in the 0.00-0.20 m layer during the PP and the PC, N in the LOM in the 0.00-0.05 m layer in the PC and the 0.05-0.10 m layer in the PP and the PC, and Cst in the 0.00-0.20 m layer in the PP and the PC than the cultivated areas, but a lower soil density (SD) and Prem in the 0.00-0.20 m layer during both the PP and the PC. Treatment P35 had more Nst in the PC and RLOM in the PP than the other cultivated treatments and the AWG. The absence of grazing in the AWG decreased the SD from the PP to the PC, while the treatments with different grazing intensities had similar values throughout this period. Our results suggest that production could be intensified under light and moderate grazing intensities in the CLI system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26622/21361,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Light sources and culture media in the in vitro growth of the Brazilian orchid Microlaelia lundii,"The Brazilian micro-orchid Microlaelia lundii enchants by its beautiful blooms in winter, but its cultivation is still a challenge, requiring specific care. The objectiv of this work was to evaluate the influence of light sources and culture media on in vitro growth and ex vitro survival of this micro-orchid. M. lundii seedlings were transferred to flasks containing the culture medium ½ MS and Simplified Medium, consisting of 5 mL L-1 of Biofert Plus® NPK fertilizer (09-08-09) and 60 g L-1 of ‘Nanica’ banana pulp. These flasks were placed in a growth chamber composed of seven environments, characterized by types of lighting: L1) LEDtube 4000K; L2) LEDtube 6500K; L3) L1 + L2; L4) L1 + L1; L5) red LED; L6) blue LED; L7) fluorescent lamp (control). After 200 days of cultivation, biometric growth parameters and leaves chlorophyll content were evaluated together with the percentage of seedling survival when acclimatized. At the end of the experiment, an analysis of individual variances and a combined analysis of the environments were carried out. The simplified medium led to higher seedlings, especially for light source L6. Light sources L1, L2, L3 and L4 promoted an increase in the seedlings root system in the simplified medium. As for the chlorophyll content, L4 and L7 showed higher contents of chlorophyll a and b. The simplified medium led practically to 100% of seedling survival, regardless of the light source used. Results shown that the simplified medium for light sources L1, L2, L3 and L4 is recommended for the in vitro propagation of M. lundii.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26482/21433,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Microbial activities, carbon, and nitrogen in an irrigated Quartzarenic Neosol cultivated with cowpea in southwest Piauí","The aim of this study was to evaluate microbial biomass and total organic carbon and nitrogen of an irrigated Quartzarenic Neosol cultivated with two cowpea cultivars in Bom Jesus, Piauí, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a randomized experimental block design in split plots. The plots consist of two cowpea cultivars (Aracê and Tumucumaque) and the subplots were composed of five different irrigation regimes (L1 = 108.2; L2 = 214.7; L3 = 287.9; L4 = 426.1, and L5 = 527.7 mm). Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0-0.20 m in order to evaluate basal soil respiration, microbial biomass carbon, metabolic quotient, microbial quotient, content, and storage of soil carbon and nitrogen. Basal soil respiration, microbial biomass carbon, microbial metabolic quotient, and microbial quotient are influenced by the interaction between cowpea cultivars and irrigation. The cultivar Aracê showed greater stimulus to the microbial community, while the irrigation regimes with 214.7 and 287.9 mm (60 and 90% of ETo, respectively) provided the best moisture conditions for microbial activities.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26465/21355,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Phenotypic characterization of açai palm germplasm from the Marajó’s archipelago and Baixo Tocantins territories,"The açai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), a native of the Amazon region, is a food of great importance. Recently, due to the discovery of its nutraceutical properties, the rational production in upland areas has been encouraged. However, to support the rational implementation of its cultivation for fruit production, which is a sort of domestication process, it is necessary to identify its germplasm. The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the genetic diversity based on phenotypic characters among açai palm mother plants derived from 11 areas of the Amazonian estuary. Twenty-nine phenotypic descriptors were used: (i) 9 from the plant, (ii) 7 related to the fruit, and (iii) 13 of agronomic nature. Principal component analysis was used to assess the phenotypic variability from standardized data obtained from selected açai palm mother plants. In the selection of the descriptors, the methods of direct selection and selection with re-analysis were used. The disposal efficiency was estimated by comparing dissimilarity groups formed by 11 origins of the açai palms based on 29 original characters and 23 selected characters. The groups were formed using the average standardized Euclidean distance and Tocher’s optimization method. All the analyses were performed using the GENES program. The selection of 79.31% of the descriptors used was significant and was considered sufficient for the evaluation of the açai palm germplasm for fruit production. The selected descriptors were shown to be capable of quantifying the phenotypic diversity of mother plants of this species, consistently grouping them using the optimization method. The cluster method showed small differences in the number and composition of the groups due to variability among the selected mother plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26447/21436,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Genetic characterization of the 28 maize landraces in Paraná State,"The characterization of maize landraces is extremely important in breeding programs for use of these genotypes as sources of genetic variability. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize 28 populations of maize landraces from the state of Paraná using the estimates of the effects of varieties and heterosis parents and the general combining ability, thereby assessing the main agronomic traits. In the crop of 2008/09, 56 inter-varietal hybrids, obtained through a topcross, 28 populations of maize landraces and three check varieties were evaluated for female flowering (FF), plant height (PH), ear height (EH) and grain mass (GY). The treatments were evaluated in a randomized block design, with two replications, at three Paraná State locations: the Experimental Center of the Agronomic Institute of Paraná in Londrina (IAPAR) and the experimental units of Pato Branco and Ponta Grossa. The data were submitted to an analysis of variance, considering a fixed model for genotypes and a random model for environments; the averages grouped by the Scott-Knott test, along with intersections of topcrosses, were analyzed according to a readapted model proposed by Oliveira et al. (1997). According to estimates of the parental effects, the GI 133 population showed the most promising estimates for all characteristics. The GI 088 and GI 173 populations stood out with promising estimates of the effects of heterosis. The conclusion is that the populations GI 133 and GI 173 may be indicated for recurrent selection programs or participation in obtaining composites.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26389/21351,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Economic analysis of corn inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense associated with nitrogen sources and doses,"Azospirillum brasilense is a bacterium known for its biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in corn crops. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research defining how much mineral N should be applied to maximize the efficiency of BNF and attain high, economically sustainable yields. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate whether adding urea with NBPT urease inhibitor might increase BNF in grasses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense associated with N sources and doses in a Cerrado biome soil by evaluating the grain yield of irrigated corn in economic terms. The experiment was conducted in Selvíria, MS, Brazil under a no-till system on a Latossolo Vermelho distrófico (Oxisol). The experiment was set up as a randomized block design with four replications in a 2 × 5 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of two sources of N (urea and urea with NBPT urease enzyme inhibitor) and five N doses applied as top-dressing (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha-1), with and without the inoculation of seeds with A. brasilense. Inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense makes corn growth much more profitable, irrespective of the dose and source of N. Addition of 200 kg ha-1 N in the form of conventional urea coupled with inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense increases grain yield; however, the highest economic return is obtained with N applied at 100 kg ha-1 with conventional urea and inoculation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26454/21354,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Models for moisture estimation in different horizons of yellow argisol using TDR,"The determination of soil moisture is very important because it is the property with the most influence on the dielectric constant of the medium. Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is an indirect technique used to estimate the water content of the soil (?) based on its dielectric constant (Ka). Like any other technique, it has advantages and disadvantages. Among the major disadvantages is the need for calibration, which requires consideration of the soil characteristics. This study aimed to perform the calibration of a TDR100 device to estimate the volumetric water content of four horizons of a Yellow Argisol. Calibration was performed under laboratory conditions using disturbed soil samples contained in PVC columns. The three rods of the handcrafted probes were vertically installed in the soil columns. Weight measurements with digital scales and daily readings of the dielectric constant with the TDR device were taken. For all soil horizons evaluated, the best fits between the dielectric constant and the volumetric water content were related to the cubic polynomial model. The Ledieu model overestimated by approximately 68 % the volumetric water content in the A and AB horizons, and underestimating by 69 % in Bt2, in relation to volumetric water content obtained by gravimetry. The underestimation by linear, Topp, Roth, and Malicki models ranged from 50 % to 85 % for all horizons.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26390/21435,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Super absorbent polymer application in seeds and planting furrow: it will be a new opportunity for rainfed agriculture,"Brazil is the fourth largest grain producer in the world. Its agriculture is mainly rainfed, with two cropping seasons per year. While the first crop (i.e., spring/summer) receives greater precipitation, the second crop (i.e., autumn/winter) is associated with greater risk of crop failure mainly due to the low rainfall, suggesting that technologies that could optimize water use during that period are needed. Superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are used in the forestry sector to reduce seedling mortality and the frequency of irrigation of eucalyptus and pinus glue owing to their ability to increase water storage capacity in the soil. However, to our knowledge, very little is known about the use of PSA in annual agricultural crops. To this end, the effects of PSA, as a seed coat or applied in the planting grooves, on the initial development of sorghum seedlings under conditions of water deficit were evaluated in two experiments under greenhouse conditions. In experiment 1, sorghum seeds with and without PSA coating were seeded in trays and subjected to three irrigation intervals to induce water deficit. The percentage of emergence and emergence speed index were evaluated and, at 26 days after sowing, seedling height, number of leaves per plant, survival rate, and dry mass of shoot and root were evaluated. In experiment 2, the seeds of sorghum with and without PSA coating were sown in pots, with PSA applied in the planting grooves. At 30 days after sowing, the plant stand, number of leaves per plant, plant height, and dry matter mass of leaves, stem, and root were evaluated. The results showed that PSA applied both as a seed coat and in planting grooves increased seedling growth and dry mass of aerial parts at 26 days and 30 days for experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, seed coating with PSA increased plant survival rate, but reduced the rate of seedling emergence in both experiments. Therefore, the use of PSA as a seed coat or applied in the planting groove has beneficial effects on the vegetative development of sorghum under low water conditions. Further research is needed to address the effect of PSA on seedling emergence.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26173/21350,E-ISSN 1679-0359

38,2017,Water potential and time of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis inoculation in wheat seeds,"Wheat seeds infected with Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the causal agent of tan spot, are partially responsible for outbreaks caused by this pathogen. Seed lots with a high incidence of P. tritici-repentis must be rapidly acquired for transmission and pathogen-control studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether changes in water potential of culture medium and variations in inoculation time might favor the infection of wheat seeds by P. tritici-repentis without compromising seed viability. Colonies of P. tritici-repentis were grown on potato-dextrose-agar (PDA) culture medium, adjusted to a water potential of -0.36 MPa, under water stress induced by mannitol at potentials of -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.0, and -1.2 MPa. Analyses were carried out to determine mycelial growth index and seed exposure time to the culture medium to start germination as a function of water potential. Afterwards, wheat seeds were placed in contact with colonies of P. tritici-repentis for 24, 48, and 72 hours at potentials of -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.0, and -1.2 MPa. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design, in a factorial scheme (water potential × inoculation time). Rates of germination, seedling emergence in soil, and seed infection were assessed. Mycelial growth was stimulated at lower water potentials, which germinated faster. A 24-hour inoculation time and a -0.4 MPa water potential were efficient to infect wheat seeds with P. tritici-repentis, without hindering seedling germination and emergence under laboratory conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25973/21346,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Floristic, structural, and allometric equations to estimate arboreal volume and biomass in a cerradão site","This objective of this study was to characterize the floristic, structural, and ecological groups and to estimate the arboreal volume and biomass of a cerradão site in Palmas, Tocantins, Brazil. A forest inventory was conducted on 10.15 ha of the study area. Plots of 400-m2 were used for systematic sampling. All standing trees (dead or alive) with a breast-height diameter (DHB) greater than 5 cm were identified and measured. Floristic diversity and horizontal structure were assessed using the Shannon and importance value indices, respectively. Forest vertical structure was classified into three stratata and the tree species were categorized into ecological groups. Ninety tree volumes were rigorously cubed and weighed. Fresh- and dry biomass were sampled and estimated. Mathematical models were applied and adjusted to estimate tree volume and biomass. It was observed that the species Myrcia splendens and Emmotum nitens and the families Fabaceae and Chrysobalanaceae were dominant in our study site. The pioneer (613 individuals ha-1) and climax (530 individuals ha-1) tree species group predominated. The floristic diversity index was estimated as 3.35 nats ind- 1. The vertical structure analysis indicated fewer individuals in the superior stratum (13%) compared to the medium (63%) and inferior (24%) stratum. The Schumacher and Hall model showed better results with regard to estimated forest production. Forest volume and biomass estimates were 126.71 m³ ha-1 and 61.67 Mg ha-1, respectively. The studied cerradão area had high floristic diversity and climax species predominated. Since this cerradão is in close proximity to the Amazon biome, its volume and biomass stocks were higher than those estimated for other cerradão and forest formations within the Cerrado biome.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26008/21348,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,The importance of Gram positive bacteria as the cause of canine pyometra,"E. coli is the main bacteria isolated from infected uterus and bacterial endotoxin can lead to fatal endotoxic shock. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) precedes the endotoxic shock. Thus, early recognition of SIRS is important for patient treatment and prognostic. In Brazil, Gram positive bacteria are responsible for approximately 20% of all pyometra cases, and there is limited information about pathophysiology of shock and tissue injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of Gram positive bacteria to cause SIRS in bitches with pyometra. A prospective follow-up of 67 bitches with pyometra was performed, which were classified as SIRS + and SIRS- on admission. All bitches were surgically treated (ovariohysterectomy), uterine contents were collected in a sterile manner and the material was submitted to microbiological evaluation. Were identified in 55.2% of bitches E. coli (G1), 23.9% other Gram negative bacteria (G2) and 20.9% Gram positive bacteria (G3). The leukocyte profile, serum biochemistry and prevalence of SIRS were similar between the groups. It is concluded that Gram positive bacteria have the capacity to promote tissue damage and can lead the patient to death after SIRS and shock, as well as by E. coli and other Gram negative.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25113/20841,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Influence of electroacupuncture on the points BP6 and E36 regarding gastric motility in Wistar rats,"The study aimed to evaluate by radiographic examination the action of electroacupuncture on gastric motility in experimental animals. We used 24 Wistar rats, three months old, that received five metallic spheres, via orogastric tube (OT), with 2mL of barium contrast, followed by treatments: electroacupuncture points E36 and BP6 (T1); electroacupuncture in stitches (T2); sterile distilled water OT (T3); metoclopramide OT (T4). After treatment, serial radiographs, hourly, were made to follow the gastric emptying time of the spheres in rats. By analyzing the time of exit of the first sphere, animals in the group T1 had an average of 3h30min; at T2 the average was higher 6 hours; in T3 was 5h18min, and T4 showed an average of 4h36min. The action of electroacupuncture was comparable to the action of metoclopramide, which is know to increase peristalsis, whereas the response of the Shan group (T2) was close to the negative control group. Considering the results it was concluded that electroacupuncture at points predetermined significantly increases gastric peristalsis, reducing gastric emptying time in rats, may be an option for the treatment of motility disorders.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23030/20851,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The accuracy with which the maps of spatial distribution of yield and the soil attributes are produced in the interpolation process influences their application and utilization. This paper aimed to compare three interpolation methods (inverse of the distance, inverse of the square distance, and ordinary kriging) in the construction of thematic maps of soybean yield and soil chemical attributes. A set of data referred to 55 sampling units for the construction maps of soybean yield and of eight soil chemical attributes, by different interpolation methods. The comparison was made based on the error matrix, by calculating the Kappa and Tau indices, beyond the relative deviation coefficient (RDC). It was noticed that the inverse of the square distance was the interpolator that less influenced the data behavior, and the best interpolation method dependent of the variability of the studied attribute. The kriging and the inverse of the square distance were considered the methods that presented the best results in the interpolation of data.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24585/20850,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Activity of plant aqueous extracts on Bacillus thuringiensis and their interactions on Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Erebinae),"The association of plant extracts and B. thuringiensis may be important in situations that control of different insects species is required and/or control of insects in various development stages. However, extracts may have different effects on B. thuringiensis, compromising their mode of action. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of aqueous plant extracts on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) and their interactions on Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Erebinae). Cherry plant extracts (Eugenia uniflora), pepper (Capsicum baccatum), trumpet (Brugmansia suaveolens) and grape japan (Hovenia dulcis), were used at 5% concentrations. For compatibility studies, the extracts were mixed with Thuricide® (Btk) and the parameters evaluated were Colony Formation Units (CFU mL-1) for spores and, the A. gemmatalis mortality for crystals. The cherry extracts, pepper, and japan grape completely inhibited the CFU ml-1 of Btk and the cherry extract alone negatively affected the toxicity of Btk crystals, with significantly lower mortality of A. gemmatalis (20.40%) than that observed in the control with only Btk (79.44%). In the association between cherry, pepper, and grape japan extracts with B. thuringiensis, the extracts exhibited a negative effect in the formation of CFU.

38,2017,Evaluation of supplementation plans for suckling beef calves managed on tropical pasture,"This study assessed the effects of different amounts of supplement on the productive performance, nutrional caracteristics and behaviour of suckling beef calves, as well as on the productive performance of their dams on tropical pastures. Forty-four male Nellore beef calves with an average age of 120 days and an initial average body weight (BW) of 145±3.7 kg and their respective dams, with an average BW of 449±6.9 kg, were used. The amounts of supplement evaluated were as follows: 0 = calves received only mineral mixture ad libitum; 3, 6, and 9 = calves received 3, 6, or 9 g kg-1 BW of supplement, respectively, containing 250 g CP kg-1 (as-fed). The experimental design was completely randomized. A positive linear effect (P < 0.01) was observed in the intakes of dry matter and organic matter, and a cubic effect (P < 0.07) was observed for the intake of neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein. There was quadratic effect (P < 0.06) for total digestibility of neutral detergent fiber. A cubic effect (P < 0.01) was observed for the calves’ performance. However, the calves’ supplementation did not affect the milk yield and performance (P ? 0.21) of their dams. The supplementation decreased grazing time (P < 0.01) but did not influence suckling time (P ? 0.59). It is recommended supplying of supplement containing 250 g CP kg-1 (as-fed) in amount 6 g kg-1 BW to suckling beef calves managed in tropical pasture. Supplementation of suckling beef calves increases the intake of dry matter, decreases grazing time and forage intake. However, it does not affect the suckling time and productive performance of their dams.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26175/20836,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Growth curve of Repartida goats reared in the Caatinga region, Brazil","This work aimed to determine which non-linear model (Brody, Gompertz, logistic, von Bertalanffy or Richards) best represents the average growth curve of goats, in addition to evaluating the effect of the environment. The weight data of 40 Repartida goats reared in the Brazil Caatinga were included in this study. Weight data was collected every 30 days from birth until 270 days of age. The parameters of the models (A, mature body weight; B, constant of integration; k, maturation rate; m, inflection point) were estimated using the NLIN procedure of SAS. The logistic model showed a slightly higher average fit in comparison to the other models. The absolute growth rate suggests that the maximum growth rate was reached early. The effect of the contemporary groups was significant (P < 0.05), but only for the estimated k parameter. The estimated correlation between the A and k parameters was significant and negative, indicating a lower probability of a high body weight in adulthood. Goats of the Repartida ecotype are characterized by their high birth weight and low weight at maturity, which combined with the nutritional deficit, suggests that these animals have adapted to the adverse conditions of the Brazilian Caatinga region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26297/20837,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Energy and tannin extract supplementation for dairy cows on annual winter pastures,"Energy supplementation can increase the consumption of metabolizable energy and substrate for microbial growth, while condensed tannins aid in increasing the duodenal flow of foodborne metabolizable proteins. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of energy supplementation and the inclusion of tannin extract (TE) from Acacia mearnsii (Weibull Black, Tanac S. A., Montenegro, Brazil) on the production performance of dairy cows grazing on winter pastures. Nine multiparous Holstein cows in mid lactation were distributed in a 3 × 3 Latin square experimental design over three periods of 28 days (21 adaptation and 7 sampling). The treatments were: without supplementation (WS), supplementation with 4 kg of corn grain (CG), and corn grain + 80 g of tannin extract (TE). The dry matter (DM) intake from pastures was similar among treatments, but the consumption of DM of the supplement was higher in the CG treatment than that in the TE treatment. The total DM intake was higher for the supplemented animals (17.3 kg?day-1) than that for the unsupplemented animals (14.9 kg?day-1) and in the TE treatment (17.7 kg?day-1) than in the CG treatment (16.7 kg day-1). Milk production increased from the unsupplemented to the supplemented animals (20.9 to 23.5 kg, respectively), while the content of urea N in the milk decreased (12.6 to 10.5 mg?100 mL-1, respectively). There were no differences in milk production or content of milk urea N between the CG and TE treatments. Energy supplementation is a tool for improving the nutritional profile and the performance of dairy cows in mid lactation grazing on annual winter pastures, while tannin extract aids in improving the energy balance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26067/20835,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Influence of production factors on feed intake and feed conversion ratio of grow-finishing pigs,"The aim of this study was to identify and quantify, through mathematical models, the production factors of grow-finishing (GF) phases that influence the daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in pigs. Sixty-five GF farms were evaluated between 2010 and 2013, linked to a cooperative system located in the western Parana State, Brazil, representing 463 batches, with a mean of 642.79 ± 363.29 animals per batch, equalling approximately 300,000 animals. Forty production factors were considered that related to management, sanitation, installations and equipment, nutrition, genetics and environment on the farms. The DFI was influenced by the barn's position relative to the sun (P = 0.048), initial body weight (P < 0.0001) and final body weight (P < 0.0001). It was observed that the FCR was influenced by the barn’s position relative to the sun (P = 0.0001), the use of humidifiers/misting (P = 0.03), the presence of composters (P = 0.006), trees on the sides of barns (P < 0.045), the initial body weight of the pigs (P < 0.0001) and duration of the grow-finishing phase (P < 0.0001). The variables selected in the models explained approximately 44 and 20% of the total variance in the DFI and FCR, respectively, demonstrating that this resource is a good tool for interpreting the factors related to the parameters evaluated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26026/20879,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Glycerin from biodiesel in the feeding of red-egg layers,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vegetable glycerin on performance and egg quality of red-egg layers in the second production cycle. A total of 252 Hy-Line Brown layers weighing 1.919 ± 0.095 kg, at 90 weeks, were used in a completely randomized design with six treatments and seven birds per replication. The experiment lasted 84 days. Treatments consisted of a control diet (no glycerin) and five diets with increasing levels of vegetable glycerin (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10%). The following variables were evaluated: feed intake (g/bird/day); egg production (%); egg weight (g); egg mass (g/bird/day); conversion per egg mass (kg kg) and per dozen eggs (kg/dz); percentages of albumen, yolk, and shell; eggshell thickness (mm); and egg specific gravity. (Y = 67.69 + 54.23X, R2 = 0.78) and egg mass (Y = 44.84 + 42.87X, R2 = 0.66) improved linearly with the glycerin levels. A quadratic effect was observed (Y = 114.11 + 336.96 X – 3,169.6 X2, R2 = 0.52) on feed intake. In conclusion, glycerin can be used to partially replace corn in diets for layers in the second production cycle at inclusion levels of up to 10%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26056/20880,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Banana peel in the diet for F1 Holstein x Zebu cows,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of includingsun-dried banana peel in diets for F1 Holstein x Zebu cows on intake, digestibility and milk production. Diets were composed of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60% replacement of sorghum silage with banana peel provided to 10 cows in two simultaneous 5 x 5 Latin squares, with the experiment divided into five periods of 16 days. The dry matter intake showed a quadratic effect with maximum level at 38.30% substitution as well as intake of crude protein expressed in kg-1 day and percentage of body weight, with maximum at the levels of 50.09 and 45.69% inclusion of the peel, respectively. The intake of neutral detergent fiber and the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein showed a decreasing linear effect. Variation in weight and body condition score, milk production and feed conversion were not affected. The replacement of 60% sorghum silage with banana peel represents a viable alternative as it causes no change in cows with average production of 16.49 kg milk with 3.5% fat day-1, reducing feeding costs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26002/20831,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Mechanical and chemical dehydration for pre-drying of black oat silage,"This study aimed to evaluate mechanical and chemical methods of forage dehydration in the production of black oat pre-dried silage (Avena strigosa Schreb) under different dehydration times. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block experimental design with five replications and arranged in a 2 x 6 factorial scheme. We assessed two methods of dehydration, mechanical and chemical, over six dewatering times, being made at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after cutting or application of glyphosate. Harvest took place at 88 days after emergence, at pre-flowering. We evaluated dry biomass production at harvest, dry matter losses during dehydration in the field, losses during ensiling, gauging effluent output, and pre-dried silage chemical composition. There was an interaction between dehydration method and harvest time for most of the production characteristics. Chemical dehydration showed an enhanced dry matter recovery at the field level, however, unsuitable for pre-dried silage. The longer the dehydration period, the lower the losses for both analyzed methods; nevertheless, the chemical method reached unsatisfactory DM contents to produce good quality silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26006/20832,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Brown rice, selenium yeast and ?-tocopherol acetate in chicken’s diet: effects on meat quality","The effects of diet supplementation with ?-tocopherol acetate (VE) and selenium yeast (SeL) on the water holding capacity (WHC), cooking weight loss (CL), drip loss (DL), pH, colour and selenium concentration of the breast of chickens fed diets based on corn or brown rice were studied. From 21 days of age, a total of 200 birds were housed in 38 floor pens (experimental unit) in a randomised 23 factorial arrangement. The levels of supplementation were VE (0 and 200 mg/kg), organic selenium (0 and 0.3 ppm) and two diets (100% corn and 100% brown rice) in a total of eight treatments: T1) corn + 0 SeL + 0 VE (control); T2) corn + 200 mg/kg VE + 0 SeL; T3) corn + 0 VE + 0.3 ppm SeL; T4) corn + 200 mg/kg VE + 0.3 ppm SeL; T5) brown rice + 0 VE +0 SeL; T6) brown rice + 200 mg/kg VE + 0 SeL; T7) brown rice + 0 VE + 0.3 ppm SeL; T8) brown rice + 200 mg/kg VE + 0.3 ppm SeL. The concentration of selenium in the breast increased with VE supplementation in the diet (P < 0.001). However, a positive interaction between VE and SeL on selenium concentration in the meat was found (P = 0.06). A better WHC with the inclusion of SeL and VE was found only in the rice-based diets. The replacement of corn by brown rice decreased (P < 0.05) the yellowness of the meat. CL and DL were not significantly affected by the treatments. Broilers fed with SeL supplemented diets showed a higher pH in the breast than diets without supplementation. In conclusion, the interaction between VE and SeL increased selenium in meat but improved WHC only in rice-based diets. The replacement of corn by brown rice decreased the yellowness of chicken breast meat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25959/20830,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Aerial parts of cassava as partial replacement for feed concentrates in the diet of lambs raised in semi-confinement,"This study aimed to evaluate the performance and economic viability of including the aerial parts of cassava (PAM) in the feed of semi-confined lambs for partial reduction of food concentrates. Fifty-six sheep, including males and females of the Pantaneira genetic group weighing 18.84 ± 2.02 kg on an average were used. The experiment was conducted in a factorial randomized complete block design with four treatments, each with seven females and seven males. Each group of 14 animals received one of four treatments: control, 10% of food concentrate in diet replaced with PAM, 20% replaced with PAM, and 30% replaced with PAM. The average total gain in weight (GWT) of the male lambs was 26.89% higher than the gains observed in females. Based on the cost analysis, we observed a linear effect (P < 0.01), i.e., a decrease in the feed cost for male and female groups with increase in PAM content. For the study period, the expenditure for the control male group was the highest at $ 17.60 per animal. Expenditure for the PAM 30 male group was the lowest at $ 12.74 per animal. These figures reflect the actual operating costs (COE), i.e., the power is 75.78% and 74.77%, for male and female groups respectively. The total cost, decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with PAM 30 treatment costing the least at $ 47.90, which was $ 7.02 lower than the control. When assessing the net margin per kilogram among the female groups, we observed a quadratic effect (P < 0.01) with a maximum gain of 23.98% when adding PAM and $ 0.50 kg-1. Our results show that the raising of lambs in semi-confinement was economically viable, and the addition of the aerial part of processed cassava in the feed presented a higher economic return. Further, the addition of aerial parts of cassava did not affect the performance of the lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25920/20878,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Fermentation characteristics and nutritional quality of elephant grass silage added the buriti fruit peel,"The objective of this research was to evaluated the inclusion of buriti fruit peel as additive on the fermentation profile, losses, chemical composition and degradability of elephant grass silage. We used a completely randomized design with five levels of buriti fruit peel (0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 g kg-1). The silos were opened after 28 days of storage. In situ degradability monitoring was conducted using a split-plot design in which four animals represented the blocks and silage supplemented with five levels of buriti fruit peel represented the treatments. The use of the additive in elephant silage increased dry matter (DM) (P < 0.001), ether extract (EE) (P < 0.001), ash (P < 0.001), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (P < 0.001) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (P= 0.0000). The pH (P= 0.0000), N-NH3 (P = 0.024) and there was a decrease in gas losses (P < 0.001), effluent losses and dry matter recovery (P = 0.218) not were influenced by the addition of buriti fruit peel. The inclusion of buriti fruit peel linearly reduced the ruminal degradability DM of soluble fraction (a) (P < 0.001) and potentially degradable insoluble fraction (b) (P < 0.001). The DM content increase with the addition of the buriti fruit peel to the elephant grass silage promotes improvements in the fermentation process, reduces losses of nutrients and ruminal disappearance of dry matter and does not significantly change the chemical composition with the inclusion of 166.7 g kg-1 of the buriti fruit peel.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25817/20828,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Somatic cell count and milk yield on physicochemical components of milk from free-stall housed cows,"Measurement and evaluation of the factors that may influence milk composition has been shown to determine the actual gains in milk quality and quantity. The study was conducted to evaluate the influence of daily milk yield on the physicochemical composition of milk and analyze the correlations between milk yield and somatic cell count (SCC) on the fat, protein, lactose, total solids and nitrogen urea contents in Holstein cows’ milk. A total of 3,544 data collected from 467 cows were evaluated. In the analysis, the animals were divided into groups – I (5-15 kg milk day-1), II (15-30 kg milk day-1) and III (above 30 kg milk day -1) – based on their daily production. Animals of Group I had higher SCC (P < 0.05) and fat and protein percentage when compared with Group III. However, the lactose content was lower (P < 0.05) than Group II and III. No correlation (P > 0.05) between SCC and fat, protein and total solids contents was observed. A lower milk yield is significantly associated with a higher SCC, which, besides hindering the quality of milk, compromises the cow's udder health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25599/20826,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Supplementation strategies for grazing beef cattle during the rainy-dry transition period,"An experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of supplementation strategies on intake, digestibility, and performance of Nellore cattle on pasture (Urochloa decumbens) during the rainy-dry transition period. The evaluated strategies were mineral supplementation (MS), self-feed supplementation (SF), and infrequent concentrate supplementation. Supplementation frequencies were three times per week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays - 3tw) and daily (7tw). Animals receiving concentrate supplementation had higher pasture DM and TDN intakes than those fed MS. There was no difference (P > 0.10) between concentrate supplementation strategies. Average pasture DM intake was 7.89, 8.09, and 8.10 kg day?1 for SF, 3tw, and 7tw, respectively. No effects were found (P > 0.10) between SF and infrequent supplementation, or for the supplementation frequencies tested. The lowest average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.10) was found for animals fed MS, and there was no difference between concentrate supplementation strategies for this variable. Average daily gains for MS, SC, 3tw, and 7tw were 661.4, 812.7, 811.5 and 819.2 g/animal, respectively. During the rainy-dry transition period, grazing beef cattle receiving concentrate supplementation have higher pasture and TDN intakes and better performance than animals fed mineral supplement only. Self-feed supplementation or supplementation provided three days per week do not compromise pasture and TDN intakes, nutrient digestibility, or performance of grazing beef cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25589/20825,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Performance and serum chemistry profile of lambs fed on rations with increasing levels of urea,"Feed intake and efficiency, animal performance, and protein and energy metabolism were studied in lambs that were fed on increasing levels of urea (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of dry matter [DM]). A completely randomized design was used, with four treatments (urea levels) and six replicates. The lambs were fed ad libitum for 56 days until they reached an average body weight of 35 kg. The rations were composed of 34% Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.) and 66% concentrate. Crude protein (CP) constituted 17% of the diet on a dry matter basis, and total digestible nutrients (TDN) accounted for 65%, on average. The dry matter intake (DMI) and crude protein intake (CPI) were not influenced by the urea levels in the diet, presenting average values of 1.175 and 0.206 kg animal-1 day-1, respectively. The average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and gross feed efficiency (GFE) were also not influenced by urea levels (0.225 kg day-1, 5.33 kg DM kg gain-1 and 0.195 kg gain kg DM-1, respectively). Except for urea and glucose concentrations, blood parameters did not change with increasing urea in the diets. The mean values for total protein, albumin, globulin and creatinine in the serum were 7.11 g dL-1, 3.36 g dL-1, 3.75 g dL-1 and 0.91 mg dL-1, respectively. Serum urea decreased linearly and serum glucose increased linearly with urea levels in the diet. The addition of 1.5% of urea to the diets did not change feed intake and efficiency or animal performance, and did not cause metabolic disorders in feedlot lambs in the finishing phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25742/20827,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Supplementation levels for non-lactating cows grazing during the rainy season,"This study aimed to evaluate levels of concentrate supplementation (1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 kg day?1) for grazing dairy cows kept on Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzania pasture during the rainy season on nutrient intake and digestibility and rumen parameters. Four rumen cannulated non-lactating Holstein × Zebu crossbred cows were used in this study by a 4X4 Latin square design, which presented an average initial body weight of 521.69±31.98 kg. Each period lasted 17 days, being the first 10 days were used for animal adaptation and the remaining seven days for data collection. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of supplementation levels on total dry matter intake, although forage dry matter intake has been linearly decreased (P < 0.05). Treatments have no effect (P > 0.05) on the digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, or ether extract. There was a linear increase (P < 0.05) on daily rumination time and total rumination times according to supplementation levels. There was no significant effect of supplementation levels (P > 0.05) or time after supplementation on rumen pH. Rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration responded quadratically (P < 0.05) to times after supplementation, with a maximum estimated concentration of 17.61 mg dL?1 at 3.87 h after supplementation. Increasing supplementation levels for grazing dairy cows reduces forage intake but has no negative effects on total dry matter intake or rumen-fluid pH.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25529/20824,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Methane production by in vitro ruminal fermentation of feed ingredients,"This study investigates the methane and carbon dioxide gas production, dry matter degradation, and final pH values obtained during the in vitro incubation of corn grain, soybean hulls, citrus pulp, corn silage, and crude glycerin. Experiments were performed using a randomized block design with four incubation periods. Each period featured four replicates per ingredient and four blanks, totaling 16 repetitions per ingredient. The lowest total amount of produced gas (37.96 mL gincubated DM-1) and the lowest final pH value (4.95) were obtained for crude glycerin (P < 0.05), which, however, exhibited the highest (P < 0.05) DM degradation. Citrus pulp produced the largest amount (P < 0.05) of CH4 per gram of incubated DM (13.56 mL g-1). However, when methane production was expressed per gram of degraded feed, the ingredients with lower degradation values, such as soybean hulls and corn silage, produced more CH4 per gram of degraded DM. Citrus pulp and corn grain produced more (P < 0.05) CO2 per gram of incubated DM. However, per gram of degraded food, citrus pulp produced the largest amount of CO2 (P < 0.05). Crude glycerin and corn grain produced less methane (per gram of degraded feed) than citrus pulp, soybean hulls, and corn silage. Differentiation of ingredients based on their methane production ability is important to express methane production per unit degraded food mass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25367/20823,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Performance of dairy calves raised under two breeding systems,"Increasing concern about some animal production systems has placed considerable value on humanitarian breeding systems, aimed at ensuring animal welfare and comfort. Raising calves is one of the most important stages in a milk production system. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of Holstein dairy calves raised by two farming systems: conventional individual (CI) and collective with automatic calf feeder (CACF). Fourteen, 15-day-old Holstein dairy calves having an average initial body weight of 40 kg, were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with seven animals per treatment. The variables evaluated were the milk and feed intake, body weight, hip height, thoracic circumference and daily weight gain. The average milk intake was lower in the CACF (3.5 L animal-1 day-1) than CI (5.1 L animal-1 day-1) system. However, the feed intake was higher in the CACF (1.205 kg animal-1 day-1) compared to CI (0.910 kg animal-1 day-1) system. Body weight, thoracic circumference, hip height and daily weight gain were similar between the two systems. The CACF raised calves had a higher concentrate intake and lower milk intake than the calves raised under the CI system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25118/20877,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Performance and egg quality parameters of laying hens submitted to different rearing densities,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different rearing densities during brooding (0 to 2 weeks) and growth (3 to 15 weeks) on performance and egg quality of laying hens (Hy-line W-36) during production phase (18 to 42 weeks). In the brooding phase, a total of 3250 day-old chicks were allocated in wire cages, distributed in a completely randomized design composed of 5 treatments (63.57; 66.38; 69.44; 72.80 and 76.50 cm²/bird) with 10 replications each. At the beginning of the growth phase, floor space in each treatment was increased. Therefore, a total of 750 birds were selected from the original treatments, which represented 237.57, 265.52, 300.92, 347.22, and 410.35 cm²/bird. At the end of the growing phase, 390 pullets were transferred to production facilities and distributed, according to their original treatment, in conventional cages with 430.76 cm²/bird (13 birds/cage). For this phase, only 6 replications per treatment were adopted. Experimental data were subjected to analysis of variance and, in the case of significant differences, means were analyzed using polynomial regression test. Body weight, weight gain and uniformity were compared during the brooding and growth phases. First-egg weight, age at first egg, age at 50% daily production, weights of egg, albumen, yolk and shell, egg mass, yolk diameter, yolk height, yolk index, albumen height, percentages of shell, albumen and yolk, shell thickness, Haugh unit, and egg specific gravity were analyzed during the production stage. In conclusion, raising pullets on 63.57 cm2/bird (71 birds/cage) does not affect chicks’ performance during the brooding phase. However, for the growth phase, the recommendation is to provide 410.35 cm2/bird, which corresponded to 11 birds/cage in this research. For the production period, the recommendation is to utilize pullets raised on 265.52 cm2/bird, which corresponded to 17 birds/cage on this research.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24770/20819,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Productive performance, body chemical composition, and deposition of 42-day-old quail for meat subjected to quantitative dietary restriction","This study aimed to assess the effect of quantitative dietary restriction during refeeding on the performance, body chemical composition, and deposition, weight gain of organs and carcass parts of quails reared for meat (Coturnix coturnix coturnix). A total of 144 quails, between 11 to 42 days old, were distributed in a completely randomized design, 4x2 factorial scheme, at four levels of feed restriction (ad libitum, 30%, 50% and 70% restrictions on the daily intake ad libitum) for both genders. Therefore, there was eight treatments with three replicates and six birds each. At the tenth day of age, the animals were housed in cages, where remained for four days under adaptation. Dietary restriction was applied between the days 15 and 35 while refeeding was carried out from day 36 to 42. Compensatory weight gain (CWG), i.e. weight gain of organs and carcass parts, and feed efficiency (FE) were improved for quails under feed restriction. Fat (F), crude protein (CP), protein deposition rate (PDR) and fat in females (FDf) and carcass retained energy in females (CREf) increased linearly as restriction levels decreased. Maximum estimates of feed intake for males (MFIm), compensatory weight gain for males (CWGm) and females (CWGf), feed efficiency for males (FEm), protein deposition for males (PDm) and carcass retained energy in males (CREm) were obtained with restriction levels of 43.56%, 30.56%, 63.93%, 62.63%, 80.25%, 1.94% and 09.34% if compared to ad libitum, respectively. As a result, we concluded that according to quantitative feed restriction level, significant increases in feed efficiency and body weight gain, as well as decreases in carcass fat throughout quail refeeding period. As for gender, given the existing sexual dimorphism, females lost greater body weight than males under dietary restriction, besides showing higher protein and fat gains in the carcass and an enhanced feed efficiency during refeeding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25075/20876,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) in feed for broiler chicks using tannin as a sequestrant of toxic metals,"This study aimed to evaluate the use of wattle tannin as an adsorbent of toxic metals in broilers fed on diets with different levels of replacement of limestone with golden mussel meal. First, we conducted a trial to evaluate the performance of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 days old when fed on wattle tannin. For this we used 720 male broiler chicks that were one day old, in a completely randomized design with six treatments and six replications. The treatments were composed of basal diets with increasing levels of wattle tannin (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 g tonne-1), where the tannin replaced the inert material of the feed. All of the diets were isonutritive and isocaloric. The results showed that 250 g tonne-1 of tannin was detrimental to weight gain, final weight and feed conversion, and the use of 1000 g tonne-1 of wattle tannin, in addition to these effects, caused a drop in consumption of the ration. There was no effect of treatment on morphometric measurements of villi, crypt or the villus:crypt ratio. Next, we conducted a second test to evaluate the performance of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 days of age when fed with increasing levels of replacement (0, 25, 50, 75, 100%) of limestone with golden mussel and even supplementation or not wattle tannin. Five repetitions were used and the birds were housed in a completely randomized design. In diets with the inclusion of tannin, 250 g tonne-1 of wattle tannin was used, which replaced the inert material in the feed. In this test, 1200 male broiler chicks that were one day old were used. The results showed that the golden mussel contains large quantities of calcium, with low concentrations of toxic metals and microbiological contamination within the allowed range. Performance data show that mussel can be used to replace up to 100% of limestone in feed without affecting the variables, but the use of 250 g tonne-1 of wattle tannin affects the performance of chicks. Bone quality was not changed by the treatments. Phosphorus and calcium in the bones remained stable during treatment and only the gray variation showed interaction effects from the use of mussel and wattle tannin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24518/20875,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Immune response of sheep naturally infected with Haemonchus spp. on pastures with two different nutritional conditions,"Parasitic nematodes in the gastrointestinal tract of small ruminants are considered one of the main causes of economical and productive losses. Haemonchus contortus is characterized as the major parasite affecting sheep worldwide. This study was designed to evaluate immunological responses in sheep naturally infected with Haemonchus spp. in two different feed grounds: native and cultivated pasture. Fecal and blood samples were collected weekly from fifteen Corriedale sheep, ages 8 to 12 months, to determine the counting of eggs per gram of feces (EPG), and the concentration of haematocrit, eosinophils, and cytokines during an 84-day experiment. Bromatological analysis of the two pasture treatments (types) showed levels of crude protein and non-fibrous carbohydrates of 9.7% and 12.3% in the native pasture and 14.3% and 23.7% for the cultivated pasture, respectively. No significant difference in haematocrit concentration was found during the experiment between different pastures (p < 0.05). However, significant differences were found in EPG, eosinophils, interleukins, and immunoglobulins levels after 21 days in the cultivated (nutritionally-enhanced) pasture. These data suggest that immune response was characterized in sheep by significantly higher peripheral eosinophilia and an increase in serum concentrations of IgE, IgA, IgG, TNF-?, IFN-?, and IL-6. Likewise, the improvement in forage condition resulted in a reduction of EPG and an increase of elements that improve a sheep’s immune system response against Haemonchus spp. infection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25869/20817,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Evaluation of nutritional plans for meat quail,"In this study, we evaluated three nutritional plans for quail from 1 to 42 days of age on performance, carcass quality, and economic viability. A total of 210 European quail were distributed into three treatments in a randomized complete design with five replicates and 14 birds in each plot. The following three treatments were tested: nutritional plan 1 - one diet, provided from 1 to 42 days of age; nutritional plan 2 - two diets, provided from 1 to 21 and 22 to 42 days of age; and nutritional plan 3 - three diets, provided from 1 to 14, 15 to 35, and 36 to 42 days of age. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared by the Student Newman Keuls (SNK) test at the 5% probability level. At 42 days of age, one bird from each sex, of each experimental unit, was slaughtered to evaluate the yields of carcass, breast, legs, and abdominal fat. Nutritional plans per rearing stage with two or three diets provided similar production performances and better feed conversion than the plan including only one diet. Studied carcass characteristics did not differ between treatments. The nutritional plan with three diets provided the best economic viability. The best nutritional plan for meat quail was that containing three types of diet, because it provided a lower cost with feed per kilogram of quail produced without compromising performance or carcass characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24472/20818,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Parasitological analysis of green leaf lettuce cultivated in different production systems,"This study analysed parasite contamination in green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa), grown in different cultivation systems (conventional, organic, and hydroponic), from a family farmer cooperative in the municipality of Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil. Samples were collected at weekly intervals during five months, totalling 180 vegetable samples (60 samples of leaf lettuce from each cultivation system). Lettuce leaves were washed with 0.5% Extran MA 02, and the resulting fluid subjected to sedimentation and centrifugal flotation for recovery of parasite structures. Overall, 71 samples (39.4%) were contaminated with at least one parasite structure, 34 (47.9%) from lettuce grown in the hydroponic system, 20 (28.2%) from the organic system, and 17 (23.9%) from the conventional system. Entamoeba spp. cysts were the most common parasite structures found in the leafy vegetables, with the highest cyst counts found in the hydroponic system (p = 0.003). It is concluded that, regardless of the cultivation system (conventional, organic, or hydroponic), there is a possibility of green leaf lettuce contamination by intestinal parasites. Measures that improve sanitary conditions during production, as well as proper hygiene during the preparation of raw leafy vegetables, may be important to reduce contamination and consequent transmission of parasite diseases from raw leafy vegetable consumption.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25607/20816,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Biochemical parameters of wild felids (Panthera leo and Panthera tigris altaica) kept in captivity,"Most populations of wild felines are now considered endangered or near extinction due to the indiscriminate hunting and the reduction of their natural habitat, caused by man. Due to the limited number of animals within a population, these species are especially vulnerable to the impacts of diseases and endogamy. In addition, wild felines are also susceptible to metabolic and behavioral changes related to a change in their natural conditions, habitat, and feeding, when the animal enters into captivity. There are few descriptions in the literature of the serum biochemistries of lions and tigers. This study presents the biochemical parameters of 23 captive lions (Panthera leo) and 10 captive Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) from the Zoological Park of the Sao Paulo Foundation. Serum urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, total, direct and indirect bilirubin were measured. In addition, serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, glucose, CK, lactate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined, as well as calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, sodium, and potassium. Biochemical parameters did not differ significantly among males and females lions, but higher albumin values were observed in male Panthera tigris altaica in comparison to females. The values obtained in this study may be used as reference for captive individuals of Panthera leo and Panthera tigris altaica.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24477/20815,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Antimicrobial multiple resistance index, minimum inhibitory concentrations, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris strains isolated from domestic animals with various clinical manifestations of infection","Proteus spp. are opportunistic multidrug resistant enterobacteria associated with diverse clinical diseases in domestic animals. However, Proteus infections in domestic animals are often misdiagnosed or considered contaminants in microbiological cultures rather than a primary agent of disease. Descriptions of Proteus infections in domestic animals are typically restricted to case reports, retrospective studies, or surveillance of other microorganisms. The present study investigated multiple antibiotic resistance indices, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and ESBL production in 73 strains of Proteus mirabilis (n = 69) and Proteus vulgaris (n = 4) isolated from domestic animals with various clinical manifestations. In dogs, the pathogen was most commonly associated with cystitis (48.21), enteritis (21.42%), otitis (14.29%), and conjunctivitis (3.57%). In bovines, the microorganism was predominant in cases of enteritis (22.22%), abscess (11.11%), otitis (11.11%), omphalitis (11.11%), and peritonitis (11.11%), and in organ fragments (11.11%). In equines (50.0%) and cats (100.0%), diarrhea was the main clinical sign. In vitro standard disk diffusion assay showed that the most effective antimicrobials against the isolates were imipenem (98.63), norfloxacin (95.89), amikacin (95.89), levofloxacin (90.41), ceftriaxone (87.64), and florfenicol (87.67). In contrast, the isolates commonly showed resistance to novobiocin (95.89), azithromycin (57.53), and trimethropim/sulfamethoxazole (39.73). Among the 73 isolates, the efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin according to MICs was 87.67%, 86.30%, 84.93%, and 82.19%, respectively. The MIC50 values of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were, respectively, 1.0, 0.004, 0.03, and 1.0 µg/mL. Thirty-three strains (45.21%) showed a antimicrobial multiple resistance index of ? 0.3. Multidrug resistance profiles of isolates were observed most frequently in dogs (n = 25; 75.76%), particularly in those with cystitis (n = 13; 52.0%), followed by bovines (n = 4; 12.12%), equines (n = 2; 6.06%), and cats (n = 2; 6.06%). Two (2.7%) strains, obtained from canine skin and feces, were diagnosed phenotypically as ESBL-producers. Here, we observed the diversity of Proteus infections in domestic animals. The presence of multidrug-resistant isolates and ESBL-producers reinforces the need for appropriate antimicrobial use and in vitro antimicrobial tests to support therapy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23923/20874,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Anti-equine arteritis virus activity of ethanolic extract and compounds from Origanum vulgare,"The equine arteritis virus (EAV) is responsible by an important respiratory and reproductive disease in equine populations and there is no specific antiviral treatment available. The objective of this study was to investigate the activity of an ethanolic crude extract of Origanum vulgare (EEO) and of isolated compound caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, luteolin, carnosol, carnosic acid, kaempferol and apigenin against EAV. The assays were performed using non-cytotoxic concentrations. The antiviral activity was monitored initially by cytopathic effect inhibition (CPE) assay in RK13 cells in the presence or absence of EEO. Pre-incubated cells with EEO were also examined to show prophylactic effect. Direct viral inactivation by EEO and isolated compounds was evaluated by incubation at 37°C or 20°C. After the incubation period, the infectivity was immediately determined by virus titrations on cell cultures and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/100 µL. There was significant virucidal activity of EEO and of the compounds caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, carnosic acid and kaempferol. When EEO was added after infection, EEO inhibited the virus growth in infected cells, as evidenced by significant reduction of the viral titre. The results provide evidence that the EEO exhibit an inhibitory effect anti-EAV. Among the main compounds evaluated, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, carnosic acid, kaempferol and mainly quercetin, contributed to the activity of EEO. EEO may represent a good prototype for the development of a new antiviral agent, presenting promising for combating arteriviruses infections.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21181/20812,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Needle muscle biopsy: technique validation and histological and histochemical methods for evaluating canine skeletal muscles,"This study evaluated the needle muscle biopsy technique using a 6G Bergström percutaneous needle combined with histological and histochemical methods to analyze the skeletal muscle of dogs. There are few studies about canine skeletal muscles and a lack of reports in the literature about tissue collection and analysis for canine species. Evaluation of 32 German Shepherd samples collected from the gluteus medius, at a depth of 3 cm, was performed. The choice of gluteus medius and the 3-cm depth provided good quantity fragments with sufficient sizes (3–5 mm), which permitted optimal visualization of muscle fibers. Myosin ATPase, at pH 9.4, 4.6, and 4.3, and SDH reactions revealed that all muscle samples analyzed had fibers in the classic mosaic arrangement, enabling counting and typification. The mean percentages of fibers were 29.95% for type I and 70.05% for type II. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the percutaneous needle biopsy technique for canine skeletal muscles is a safe and easy procedure that obtains fragments of proper sizes, thereby enabling the study of muscle fibers. Standardization of the muscle of choice and the depth of muscle sample collection significantly contributed to this success. This is an important method to evaluate muscle fiber types of dogs and diagnose important diseases affecting the skeletal muscles.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22271/20813,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Gas exchange of citrus rootstocks in response to intensity and duration of saline stress,"Soil and water salinity cause physiological disorders in sensitive plants, such as altered gas exchange in citrus genotypes. However, it is possible to analyse these effects and to identify genotypes tolerant to salt stress. An experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the tolerance of citrus genotypes considering the irrigation with saline water during rootstock formation. The study took place under greenhouse conditions in Pombal county, Paraiba, Brazil. A randomised block design was used, with treatments arranged in a factorial scheme (5 x 8). The two factors were: [i] five salinity levels of irrigation water (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2 and 4.0 dS m-1) and [ii] eight genotypes of citrus rootstocks: 1. ‘Rangpur Santa Cruz’ lime (LCRSTC); 2. common ‘Sunki’ mandarin (TSKC) x ‘Swingle’ citrumelo (CTSW) - 028; 3. TSKC x CTSW - 033; 4. TSKC x CTSW - 041; 5. ‘Volkamer’ lemon (LVK) x ‘Rangpur’ lime (LCR) - 038; 6. ‘Sunki of Florida’ mandarin (TSKFL); 7. TSKC and 8. ‘Florida’ rough lemon (LRF). Gas exchange was evaluated at 15, 30 and 60 days after the beginning of the saline water application. High water salinity reduces gas exchange in citrus genotypes, which was more evident at 15 days from the beginning of stress. The genotypes ‘Santa Cruz Rangpur’ lime, TSKC x CTSW - 041, LVK x LCR - 038 and ‘Florida’ rough lemon exhibit a satisfactory physiological behaviour during the first 30 days of exposure to the stress, showing moderate tolerance to salt stress. The genotypes TSKC x CTSW - 033 and common ‘Sunki’ mandarin are the most sensitive to salinity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25237/20873,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Quality and safety of artisan cheese produced in the serrana region of Santa Catarina,"The serrano artisan cheese produced from raw milk of dairy cattle is a typical product of high-altitude farms in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. However, marketing of the cheeses occurs illegally because they lack the minimum maturation period required for cheese produced from raw milk. The production of artisan cheeses is required to follow strict hygiene standards. This study aimed to test the quality and safety of cheeses that were produced in 31 farms of the Serrana region in Santa Catarina after 14 and 28 days of maturation. Coliform count was measured at 35 °C, and presence of other microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Listeria spp., and Salmonella spp. were also tested. Fat and protein percentages, acidity, salt content, and humidity were also evaluated. Data were subjected to statistical analyses using the SAS® software. After 14 and 28 days of maturation, 74.19% (23/31) and 64.52% (20/31) of samples, respectively, showed higher numbers of coliforms at 35 °C than those permissible by law. Higher than permissible numbers of E. coli were observed in 45.16% (14/31) and 48.39% (15/31) of the samples analyzed after 14 and 28 days of maturation, respectively. Coagulase-positive staphylococci values above 103 CFU/g were observed in 54.84% (17/31) and 51.61% (16/31) of cheese samples after 14 and 28 days of maturation, respectively. Contamination with Salmonella spp. was not detected. However, Listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b was isolated in 3.23% (1/31) and 6.45% (2/31) of samples after 14 and 28 days of maturation, respectively. The results of humidity tests classified the cheese samples into three categories: low, medium, and high humidity. Semi fat cheeses were predominant in both maturation periods, although the samples were classified in thin, semi fat, and fat cheeses. The main variations in the compositions of analyzed samples occurred for salt and acidity levels. The maturation process has not proven to be effective in reducing microbiological contamination to compliance levels. Considering the heterogeneity of the analyzed cheese samples, the frequency of non-conformities with respect to microorganisms and pathogens present in the samples, this study indicates the necessity to improve the Serrano artisan cheese production system through adoption of good manufacturing practice measures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25231/20810,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Lactose reduced ice cream enriched with whey powder,"Ice cream is a food product that pleases the palate of consumers worldwide. Whey powder (WP) has various technological and functional properties. However, WP increases the lactose content of the final products in which it is incorporated and causes grittiness and intolerance in lactose-sensitive individuals. This study aimed to produce ice cream with milk powder (MP) replaced by WP (MP/WP), decrease the lactose content by enzymatic hydrolysis and verify the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the final product. Initially, the variables ?-galactosidase concentration and reaction time were studied for the response of the percentage of lactose hydrolysis in a milk ice cream base, using a full 22 factorial design(FFD).With the reaction conditions defined (0.5 g L-1 of ?-galactosidase at 37 C for 4 h)the sucrose concentration and MP/WP replacement variables were then studied in the ice cream formulation for the percentage of lactose hydrolysis and overrun responses using a 22 FFD. The lactose hydrolysis, which ranged between 86.59-97.97%, was not affected by the MP/WP replacement in the ice cream, whilst the overrun was increased by the MP/WP replacement. The physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the ice cream were either not influenced or positively influenced by lactose hydrolysis and MP/WP replacement.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25474/20811,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Root growth of soybean cultivars under different water availability conditions,"Vigorous growth of soybean root system is a desired trait in breeding programs. However, few studies have evaluated this feature under field conditions. The aim of this research was to evaluate root growth of eight soybean cultivars under different water availability conditions. The experiment was carried out in Londrina, Paraná state, Brazil, during two growing seasons - with and without water deficit during the vegetative period. Soybean roots were sampled at flowering and assessed for dry matter yield, area and length at 0-0.25; 0.25-0.50; 0.50-0.75 and 0.75-1.00 m depth ranges. On average, root length and area of the cultivars Embrapa 48 and BRS 284 under water deficit were 66% and 40% larger than the others at 0.25-0.50 and 0.50-0.75 m layers, respectively. Under suitable water supply, BRS 282 showed the highest root length and area. Apart from the cultivars Embrapa 48, BRS 284, and BRS 255RR, soybean root growth was mostly lower under water deficit throughout the vegetative stage, which might been due to a higher soil resistance to root penetration, resulting from low soil water content. Drought increased the proportion of soybean roots at subsoil layers, mainly for Embrapa 48 and BRS 284. The cultivars Embrapa 48 and BRS 284 are promising to be used in breeding programs targeting superior root growth in subsoil layers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25212/20809,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Recent changes in agrarian systems of the Microregion of Toledo and Northern Pioneer Territory in Paraná State, Brazil","During the period of 1950 through 2000, a green-revolution-based model mostly for commodities boosted global agricultural production. From the 70’s, this design became consolidated in Brazil and other countries because of policies and strategies by states and private groups. However, some doubts has been raised on its environmental and socioeconomic issues, in special for family farming. This study aimed to contribute by identifying changes and resistance in agricultural structures, systems and demographic aspects of this model and its adoption by farmers. It was carried out in the state of Paraná - Brazil, within the microregion of Toledo and in the northern pioneer area, which represent the history and diversity of this state about socioeconomic and human aspects, as well as technical development. It was based on statistics of agricultural censuses (1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1996 and 2006), population censuses (1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010) and municipal agricultural production data (1980-2012). Data from both areas were compared to each other and analyzed in face of state changes. There has been a decrease in farming properties and rural population, with an outstanding decline in the number of young people and women. Moreover, results showed a large reduction of properties with 20 to 50 ha, and an increase in those of up to 2 ha. Such decline is due to technological standard changes throughout the period, as well as recent grants offered to rural areas, as housing and leisure spaces. Both regions showed expansion of soybean plantations, but integrating distinctively to agriculture and, finally, family farming continuity, despite the intense changes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25147/20808,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Instability of the expression of morphological and phenological descriptors to environmental variation in white oat,"Morphological and phenological characters are used in the selection, breeding, and description of plant varieties with varying genotypes. The stability of these descriptors in the face of environmental changes can determine their usefulness in situations where plant varieties must be reliably identified. The objective of this study was to verify the expression of morphological and phenological descriptors and use them to distinguish between white oat cultivars (Avena sativa L.) in two growing periods. For this, five cultivars, protected and belonging to four breeders, referred to as G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5, were sown in the typical growing season in southern Brazil (autumn-winter) and outside that period (winter-spring), and grown for forty days. The experiment was established in the field, in a randomized block design replicated three times. The cultivars were evaluated for 42 descriptors (15 quantitative and 27 qualitative). Quantitative data were analyzed by analysis of variance, the comparison of averages, and multivariate analysis by generating average euclidean distances. Qualitative data were analyzed by mode determination, followed by obtaining the similarity index. The relationship between cultivars was illustrated by dendrograms. The stability index for each descriptor was calculated. A genotype x environment interaction was observed for 28 descriptors. The stability of descriptor appearance and persistence over the growing season was higher in qualitative (44%) than in quantitative (7%) descriptors. The most stable qualitative descriptors were lemma color, hairiness of the upper node, flag leaf position, hairiness of the base of the grain, basal grain length, and rachilla length. The most stable quantitative descriptor was flag leaf length. Shifting the white oat growing season from autumn-winter to winter-spring reduced the cycle and modified the expression of most descriptors by changing the phenotypic distinctness between cultivars.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25123/20872,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Chemical soil attributes after wheat cropping under nitrogen fertilization and inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense,"Azospirillum brasilense plays an important role in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in grasses. However, further studies are needed to define how much mineral N can be applied while simultaneously maintaining BNF contribution and maximizing crop yield and to determine the impact of these practices on soil fertility. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of inoculation with A. brasilense, in conjunction with varying N doses and sources in a Cerrado soil, on soil chemical attributes after two years of irrigated wheat production. The experiment was initiated in Selvíria - MS under no-tillage production in an Oxisol in 2014 and 2015. The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications, and treatments were arranged in a 2 x 5 x 2 factorial arrangement as follows: two N sources (urea and Super N - urea with inhibitor of the enzyme urease NBPT (N - (n-butyl thiophosphoric triamide))), five N rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha-1), and with or without seed inoculation with A. brasilense. The increase in N rates did not influence the chemical soil attributes. Super N acidified the soil more compared to urea. A. brasilense inoculation reduced the effect of soil acidification in intensive irrigated wheat cultivation; however, the base extraction was higher, resulting in a lower soil CEC after cultivation with inoculation. Therefore, the cultivation of wheat inoculated with A. brasilense was not harmful to soil fertility because it did not reduce the base saturation and organic matter content (P, K, Ca, Mg, and S).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25051/20805,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Biological and microbiological attributes in Oxisol managed with cover crops,"The inclusion of winter cover crops and fertilization with nitrogen to the soil can have an effect on their biological and microbiological attributes. The aim of this study was to evaluate biological and microbiological attributes in soil under different winter cover crops and nitrogen doses. The experiment was conducted at the Frederico Westphalen-RS campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) in a Rhodic Hapludox soil. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial arrangement (2 x 10): 10 winter cover crops systems (Fallow [control], black oats, white oats, ryegrass, forage turnip, vetch, white lupine; black oat + forage turnip; black oat + vetch and black oat + vetch + fodder turnip), and two nitrogen rates in the form of urea applied in successive crops of beans common and maize, with four replications. We assessed the biological attributes (Margalef’s richness, Simpson’s dominance, Shannon’s diversity and abundance of organisms) and microbiological (carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient of the soil). The fallow with wild species and white lupine showed greater Simpson’s dominance and abundance of organisms due to the increase in the number of individuals of the order Collembola. Vetch improved the biological attributes of the soil with increase in Collembola abundance and diversity of organisms of soil fauna. The application of nitrogen favored the microbial biomass carbon and reduced the metabolic quotient.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24882/20870,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Physiology of ‘Paluma’ guava under irrigation with saline water and nitrogen fertilization,"The use of saline water in irrigation causes osmotic and toxic effects and nutritional imbalance in plants, leading to morphophysiological modifications in the leaves and compromising the production of photosynthetic pigments, which negatively reflects in the growth and development of the crops. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of irrigation water salinity on the content of photosynthetic pigments and leaf morphophysiology of guava seedlings cv. ‘Paluma’ under nitrogen (N) fertilization. A randomized block design was used, testing five levels of irrigation water electrical conductivity - ECw (0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7, and 3.5 dS m-1) and four N doses (541.1, 773.0, 1,004.9, and 1,236.8 mg of N dm-3 of soil) in a 5 x 4 factorial scheme with three replicates and five plants per plot. The contents of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves of the guava seedlings cv. ‘Paluma’ were inhibited by the increase in irrigation water salinity at 190 days after emergence, and the salt stress was lessened with the N dose of 1,004.9 mg dm-3 up to an ECw level of 1.2 dS m-1. Leaf morphophysiology of guava seedlings was not compromised by irrigation water salinity up to 1.5 dS m-1, and the highest values were obtained in plants fertilized with 541.1 mg of N dm-3.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24545/20869,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Granulometric and oxidizable carbon fractions of soil organic matter in crop-livestock integration systems,"The identification of the labile and recalcitrant forms of soil organic matter (SOM) allows to rapidly define, or even predict if the management used favors increments or losses of carbon in the soil. Thus, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of different grazing intensities and soybean crops on the oxidizable and granulometric fractions of the SOM in a crop-livestock integration combined with no-tillage system (CLI-NTS), established in 2009 in the Goiás Federal University. The treatments consisted of three different pasture heights (0.25 m P25; 0.35 m P35; 0.45 m P45), and areas without grazing (AWG), and a native vegetation area of the Cerrado biome (NCA), adjacent to the experimental area, was evaluated as references and compared with the cultivated areas. Soil samples (Oxisol - USDA; typic distroferric Red Latosol - SiBCS) were collected in the layers 0.00-0.05; 0.05-0.10 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m of each area, and arranged in a completely randomized experimental design with six replications. The soil total carbon was quantified (TC) by dry combustion. The SOM granulometry and oxidizable SOM were fractionated into particulate carbon (OCp), carbon bond with minerals (OCm) and four oxidizable fractions with increasing degrees of recalcitrance (F1 < F2 < F3 < F4). These soil attributes were evaluated at two different times, representing the post-pasture cycle (PP) and post-soybean crop (PC) periods. The lower contents of total soil carbon (TC) were found in the F1 and F3 fractions of the area without grazing, suggesting that the crop-livestock integration increases the organic matter content in the soil surface layer regardless of the pasture height. The areas without grazing and with different pasture heights in CLI had similar contents of OCp and OCm due to the experiment short time of implementation (3 years). The fractionation of the oxidizable SOM was more sensitive in differentiating the treatments, showing that the higher intensity of grazing used (P25) provided a better balance of carbon accumulation between the SOM labile and recalcitrant fractions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24512/20801,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Own-rooted scion trees (without rootstock) were used as controls in each trial and all rootstocks were propagated from herbaceous cuttings. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and each plot consisting of a single plant. Three SPAD measurements were taken between January and April 2015. SPAD index values for rootstocks ‘Mirabolano 29C’ (P. cerasifera) and ‘Marianna 2624’ (P. cerasifera x P. munsoniana) were significantly lower in the three scion cultivars, culminating with tree death from graft incompatibility. Rootstocks ‘Mirabolano 29C’ and ‘Marianna 2624’ showed translocated graft incompatibility with scion cultivars BRS-Kampai, Jade, and Maciel and tree death was preceded by a reduction in SPAD index values five months after field planting. No reduction in SPAD index values was observed in the other scion/rootstock combinations nine months after planting, but these combinations should be monitored for a longer period to confirm their graft compatibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24589/20803,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Size, physiological quality, and green seed occurrence influenced by seeding rate in soybeans","The seeding rate influences the intraspecific competition, which might affect the development and quality of seeds in soybean. However, the impact of seeding rate on the physical and physiological qualities of soybean seeds needs to be better elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of soybean plant density on the seed size as well as the effects of the interaction between the plant density and seed size on the seed mass, green seed occurence, and physiological seed quality. The experiments were carried out in the growing seasons of the years 2013/14 and 2014/15 in a Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico, under a randomized complete block design, using the NK 7059 RR cultivar with six replications. Four plant densities (150, 300, 440, and 560 thousand viable seeds ha–1) were evaluated. After the classification of seeds into four sizes, using a set of sieves, a 4 ×4 factorial scheme was used for the statistical analysis of the four plant densities and four seed sizes. The seed samples were evaluated for the seed mass, green seed percentage, germination, and vigor. Under thermal and water stress during seed development, an increase in the seeding rate led to a reduction in the green seed occurrence and an increase in the seed size and mass. However, in the absence of thermal and water stress, the seed size and mass were not altered by the seeding rate and, there was no occurrence of green seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24494/20800,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Phosphorus bioavailability in soybean grown after pasture under different fertility regimes,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the residual effect of phosphorus (P) fertilizer applied to an Urochloa decumbens cv. Basilisk pasture on the P bioavailability to the following soybean crop. Low-productivity pasture, planted on an Oxisol in an experimental field at Embrapa Cerrados, was divided into three strips, each of 1.5 ha and fertilized by broadcasting annual applications of 0, 20 and 40 kg ha-1 of P2O5 for four years. After the pasture was desiccate with herbicide, soybeans were sown and fertilized with 0, 50 and 100 kg ha-1 of P2O5 applied within each strip, making a total of nine (3x3) P treatments. Residual available P content (Mehlich-1 and resin) from the pasture fertilization was lower than from soybean fertilization. However, the bioavailable residual P from the pasture, determined by P accumulated in plants, production of dry matter and grain yield, had similar availability to inorganic P applied to the soybean. Early P fertilization applied to pasture is technically feasible and can be used to maintain the pasture: it is recommended to replace corrective fertilization for following soybean crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23868/20868,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Improvement of growth and productivity of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) through foliar applications of naphthalene acetic acid,"Plant growth regulators like naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) positively affect the growth and yield of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to check the foliar application of NAA on growth and yield components of cotton variety Bt.121 under field condition at research area of agriculture farm near Cholistan Institute of Desert Studies (CIDS), The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The experiment was comprised of foliar application of NAA (1%) viz. T0 (control), T1 (One spray of NAA), T2 (Two sprays of NAA), T3 (Three sprays of NAA), T4 (Four sprays of NAA). The first foliar spray was applied at 45 days after sowing (DAS) and later on it was continued with 15 days interval with skilled labour by hand pump sprayer. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design and each treatment was replicated three times. Data recorded on growth, chlorophyll contents, yield and yield components showed a significant increase with the application of NAA. Furthermore, earliness index, mean maturity date and production rate index were also influenced with foliar application of NAA. On the basis of growth and yield parameters it can be concluded that four spray of NAA (1%) can be applied commercially under field conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23409/20797,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Agronomic characterization and responses to coffeeleaf rust in coffee progenies resistant to the gall nematode Meloidogyne exigua,"The aim of this study was to determine agronomic characteristics and responses to the coffee leaf rust fungus (Hemileia vastatrix Berk. et Br.) in coffee progenies resistant to the gall nematode Meloidogyne exigua. The experiment was conducted in December 2000 at Ouro Verde Farm (FazendaOuro Verde), located in the municipality of Campos Altos – Minas Gerais (MG). Ten F3:4 progenies were evaluated. They were derived from crosses between CIFC 2570 Timor Hybrid selections and Catuaí cultivars known to be resistant to M. exigua. The Catuaí Vermelho IAC 99 cultivar served as a control. A randomized block design with three replicates was used. In total, there were thirty-three plots consisting of eight plants each. The following characteristics were assessed between the harvests of 2011/2012 and 2014/2015: (a) yield expressed as processed coffee bags ha-1; (b) rust incidence and severity; (c) vegetative vigor; (d) percentage of coffee fruits at the “cherry” stage; (e) percentage of floaters; (f) crown diameter; (g) percentage of coffee beans of size sieve 17 and higher; and (h) sensory analysis of the coffee beverage. The results indicated the following: (a) the H514-7-14-2, H514-7-4-5, H493-1-2-2, H514-7-16-3, H514-7-8-11, H518-2-10-1, and H514-5-2-4 progenies were the most productive; (b) all progenies showed promising resistance to coffee leaf rust; (c) all genotypes had the potential for specialty coffee production; (d) the H493-1-2-2 progeny showed resistance both to rust and the nematode, and has good potential for specialty coffee production; and (e) the yields of the H514-7-8-11, H518-2-10-1, H514-5-2-4, H514-7-16-3, H514-7-14-2, H514-7-4-5, and H493-1-2-2 progenies were significantly higher than that of the Catuaí IAC 99 control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25052/20871,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Residual compost from the production of Bactris gasipaes Kunth and Pleurotus ostreatus as soil conditioners for Lactuca sativa ‘Veronica’,"This study evaluated the residual compost from the production of Bactris gasipaes Kunth (pupunha heart of palm) (RP) and the mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus (RM). The residuals were used as soil conditioners for Lactuca sativa ‘Veronica’ crops. After adding RP and RM to the soil, all treatments exhibited similar behaviors and soils in each treatment were classified as eutrophic. Soil treatments involving increased application of residual compost resulted in the production of lettuce with greater widths because of an increase in the angle between the stem and leaf, resulting from a lack of nitrogen available to the plant. Soil treatments with 5% of RP and RM resulted in a 1.7 and 1.2 times (44% and 22%, respectively) decrease in dry weight of lettuce, as compared to the soil without residual compost addition. The addition of RP and RM as soil substrate reduced the growth of lettuce compared to the soil without residual compost. In general, the possibility of replacing chemical fertilizers (NPK) with RP or RM without previous composting was found to be inefficient. The resultant dry weight parameters were below the commercial level, and a complete period of composting RP and RM was deemed necessary for incorporating nitrogen into the soil. Lignocellulosic mushrooms such as Pleurotus spp. present highly fibrous residual compost with low nitrogen content, thus requiring a full period of composting before subsequent use in soil enrichment for various crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23974/20799,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Strobilurin and boscalid in the quality of net melon fruits,"Until recently, fungicides were used exclusively for disease control; however observations of physiological effects brought a new concept to the use of these products. Strobilurins have positive physiological effects on crop yield, due to the increase of liquid photosynthesis and better hormonal balance. However, boscalid complements the action of these fungicides, applied alternately or together. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of strobilurins (azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin), boscalid and the mixture of these on the physical-chemical quality of net melon fruits (Cucumis melo var. Reticulatus). The experiment was conducted in the municipality of São Manuel (SP), using the hybrid of Cantaloupe M2-308 net melon, the experimental design was in randomized blocks with five replicates. The treatments used were: T1 - control; T2 - azoxystrobin 60g ha-1 of active principle (a.p.); T3 - boscalid 75g ha-1 of the a.p.; T4 - pyraclostrobin 50g ha-1 of the a.p.; T5 - boscalid (37,5g ha-1) of the a.p. + pyraclostrobin (25g ha-1) of the a.p. The first application of the treatments was carried out at fourteen days after the transplanting of the seedlings and the others at seven day intervals, totaling eight applications throughout the cycle. Two fruits of each plot were collected, which were identified for analysis in the laboratory. The following characteristics were evaluated: fresh fruit mass; mesocarp thickness, pulp texture, peel trajectory, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids and the ratio. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and the averages compared by the Tukey test at 5% probability using the SISVAR program. The fruits of the plants treated with boscalid 75g ha-1 were the ones that showed higher concentration of soluble solids and low titratable acidity, resulting in a better ratio. Despite the lower value, the fruits of the plants treated with pyraclostrobin 50g ha-1 showed a high ratio value, besides presenting higher value for pulp texture. The mixture of boscalid (37.5g ha-1) + pyraclostrobin (25g ha-1) also showed high values of soluble solids which resulted in a good “ratio” value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21485/20795,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Relationship between soil organic matter and nematodes in sugarcane fields,"Sugarcane plays an important socio-economic role in northeastern Brazil. However, the low yield in this region is associated with several factors (e.g. frequent occurrence of plant-parasitic nematodes). In order to observe the influence of soil organic matter on the nematodes, this study aimed to characterize the spatial nematode distribution in a sugarcane field. The study was carried out in Goiana - Pernambuco State (Brazil), fifty days after sugarcane cutting (10 days after vinasse application). The sampling scheme consisted of a regular 60 × 50-m grid, 10 m spaced, through 0 to 0.2 m depth. Spatial distribution was evaluated by semivariograms fit and performed by ordinary kriging interpolation for mapping. Exponential and spherical models promoted the best fit to semivariograms, resulting in ranges from 16 to 19 m. There was a strong negative correlation between soil organic matter and plant-parasitic nematode population density. Free-living nematodes had a similar distribution pattern as soil organic matter content. These results indicated that soil organic matter had important effects on spatial distribution of both plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23393/20796,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,A report of the Maquet procedure for the management of cranial cruciate ligament rupture in a dog - a case report,"Cranial cruciate ligament rupture is the major cause of lameness and degenerative joint disease in the canine stifle. The cause of this disease is multifactorial, especially involving degenerative and inflammatory changes. Many techniques have been described for the management of this condition, and current recommendations include the use of corrective osteotomies, most recently using the Maquet (or modified Maquet) procedure. This technique is fundamentally similar to the classical tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA), but without the use of the bone plate. The main advantages of using this technique are a shorter operative time and less use of implants. The main complication of this technique is an increased risk of tibial crest fracture. This report describes the Maquet technique for the treatment of a three-year-old male West White Terrier dog with rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament. Cruciate ligament rupture was diagnosed by a positive cranial tibial drawer test. Mediolateral stifle radiography performed under anesthesia with the stifle in 135° of extension demonstrated a tibial plateau angle of 22°. A cage of six millimeters was necessary to allow advancement. The Maquet technique produced excellent post-operative results, including early weight-bearing and neutralization of the cranial tibial drawer. The consolidation time of the osteotomy was 63 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22602/20560,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Dermatophytosis due to Microsporum nanum infection in a canine,"Miscrosporum nanum is a dermatophyte found in swine that causes non-pruritic lesions with desquamation, alopecia, and circular characteristics. M. nanum infection in dogs is rare and poorly understood in terms of its epidemiological and clinical features, and its therapeutic response. The present report describes a case of dermatophytosis due to M. nanum in a Dogo Argentino breed of dog that was used for wild boar hunting. The dermatophytosis presented with hypotrichosis, erythema, and non-pruritic desquamation in the back of the neck and chest area. The dermatophytosis was responsive to systemic treatment with itraconazole and topical (miconazole 2%) for 60 days. Thus, we conclude that the practice of hunting wild boar should be considered as a possible source of infection of M. nanum in the reported dog. The M. nanum infection showed clinical features that were similar to the lesions observed in swine, except for the absence of the circular pattern, and showed a good clinical response to the therapy. Finally, M. nanum should be considered as an etiologic agent of dermatophytosis in dogs that in some manner have had direct contact with domestic or wild swine.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22424/20559,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome in a rottweiler: a case report,"Eosinophils are cells of the immune system that have several important functions including phagocytosis of microorganisms, antigen presentation, contribution to chronic inflammation, and immunity against parasites. The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disease in humans that is characterized by persistent eosinophilia (over six months) and variable eosinophil infiltration in organs such as the lungs, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. Once in the tissues, these cells can cause damage by various mechanisms such as release of cytotoxic oxygen free radical and proteins. No etiology has yet been established for HES. The clinical signs vary and relate to the organs involved. In veterinary medicine, the disease has been described in cats, but rarely in dogs, with Rottweilers apparently more predisposed to developing the disease. Owing to the small number of cases reported in the veterinary literature, the prognosis of this disease and the most appropriate treatment options are unclear. Although it can be fatal in animals showing severe clinical symptoms, spontaneous remission may also occur. This study reports a case of HES in a Rottweiler in which the predominant clinical sign was abdominal effusion. We discuss the clinical and laboratory aspects of the disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21259/20611,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Nephroblastoma with lymphatic metastasis in an Angus calf: scientific communication,"Nephroblastoma is a congenital renal neoplasm composed of metanephric blastema and stromal cells. A one-year-old male Angus calf presented with diarrhea, nasal discharge, cough and weight loss. Serum levels of creatinine and urea were increased, with reduction in the level of albumin. After eight days, clinical condition got worse and the calf died. On necropsy, the cranial pole of the left kidney presented a firm whitish mass (30 x 21 x 14 cm). Multifocal to coalescing firm whitish nodules were observed on the serosa of the large intestine, in the mesentery and in the adventitia of the urinary bladder. All lung lobes contained multifocal to coalescing firm whitish elevated nodules (0.5 to 1 cm of diameter). Histologically, renal mass consisted of neoplastic proliferation of embryonal epithelial and mesenchymal cells, intermixed with large amounts of blastema cells. The nodules on large intestine, mesentery, urinary bladder and lungs were composed mainly of blastema cells and mild amount of mesenchymal cells. Blastema cells were also observed within lymphatic vessels in lung parenchyma. Embryonal epithelial, mesenchymal and blastema cells showed, respectively, positive immunostain for cytokeratin, vimentin and S100. Based on pathological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was diagnosed as nephroblastoma in a calf with metastasis through lymphatic vessels to lungs, large intestine, mesentery and urinary bladder.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24823/20672,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Detection of anti-Leptospira antibodies in domestic captive primates from Acre, Brazil","Because the Wild Animals Screening Center (CETAS) focuses intensely on restoration and maintenance of primate health and diversity in the Amazon region, detection of potential threats to animal health is crucial. In this view, neglected infections such as leptospirosis are of particular interest. In this report, we have studied the seroreactivity of anti-Leptospira antibodies from primate blood samples collected at CETAS between September 2011 and September 2012. Of the 14 animals investigated by the microscopic agglutination test using live antigens, five (35.7%) were reactive against serovars Celledoni (1), Hebdomadis (1), Icterohaemorrhagiae (2), and Sejroe (1). The results indicate that it is important to identify the contact of these animals with possible pathogens in order to ensure reintroduction of healthy animals into the wild and further understand the disease epidemiology in animals under captivity, gathering, and voluntary surrender of domestic captivity in Acre, Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23558/20600,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Physical properties of sunflower seeds during drying,"The aim of this work was to determine the effect that the moisture content has on the physical properties of sunflower seeds. The cultivar Olisun 3, with an initial moisture content of 34.1 (% wb), was used and then subjected to drying in an oven with forced air ventilation under three temperature conditions: 40, 60 and 80 °C. The reduction in the moisture content during drying was monitored by the gravimetric method until it reached a final moisture content of 8.0 ± 1.0 (% wb). The physical properties were analysed: the bulk density, true density, intergranular porosity and volumetric shrinkage of the mass and unit and terminal velocity. The reduction in the moisture content influenced the physical properties of sunflower seeds and caused a decrease in the intergranular porosity, bulk density and true density at all examined temperatures. The mass and volumetric contractions of the unit and reduction in shrinkage rates all increased with the drying of sunflower seeds at all studied temperatures. The terminal velocity increased as the moisture content of the grains increased, which was more evident at the drying temperature of 80 °C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23765/20669,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Occurrence of Leishmania chagasi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia canis vogeli, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis in canine blood donors","The transfusion of blood components is common in a veterinary clinic; however, the safety of this therapeutic measure cannot always be guaranteed. Studies show a high risk of haemoparasite transmission during blood transfusion in canines. These parasites include Leishmania chagasi, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis, which are endemic to the city of Cuiabá. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of L. chagasi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia (canis) vogeli, A. platys, and E. canis in canine blood donor candidates, and identify possible factors associated with the infection of these agents. Sixty-six canines were evaluated using serologic and molecular tests, for the presence of the Leishmania species. While one canine sample showed a positive result for L. chagasi with indirect fluorescent antibody test, with titer of 1:40, and seven canine samples were positive using DPP, all other samples were negative when using PCR and ELISA. All canines were negative for T. cruzi when using PCR. The B. (c.) vogeli infection was identified in one canine and A. platys was identified in six canines. E. canis was identified in 17 canines, with a prevalence of 25.7%. There were no significant factors associated with the infection of the pathogens investigated. Given the observation of infection, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, emphasis must be placed on the need for the use of more sensitive and specific diagnostic methods for the screening of donor canines.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23499/20671,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Twenty female lambs and five rumen-cannulated lambs were used to test supplementation effects on weight gain and nutritional characteristics, respectively. Treatments evaluated were: mineral mixture, supplement with 20 and 25% of crude protein offered at 0.5 and 1.0% of body weight. Supplementation at 1.0% of body weight reduced forage intake. Average daily gain were: -58.33, -1.07, -9.53, 19.27 and 34.73 g day-1 per animal, for mineral mixture, supplements with 20 and 25% of crude protein supplied at 0.5% of body weight and 20 and 25% crude protein provided at 1.0% of body weight, respectively. Rumen pH for all supplements was maintained above 6.20. Values of rumen ammonia nitrogen were 5.10, 9.48, 11.54, 17.51 and 22.45 mg dL-1 for supplements: mineral mixture, 20 and 25% of crude protein provided at 0.5% of body weight and 20 and 25% of crude protein supplied at 1.0% of body weight, respectively.

The experiment was conducted using four different N concentrations (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha) during the establishment period in order to evaluate the effect of nitrogen on the plant. These effects were assessed using different indexes, including the efficiency of nitrogen use and agricultural, physiological and nutritional efficiencies. We also determined the total dry matter and nitrogen accumulation in the plant. The recovery of applied N and the agronomic efficiency of Mombasa grass were found to be greater with increasing N concentrations, and all indexes tested were found to be affected by the concentration of applied N.

38,2017,Chemical composition of corn silage produced by scientific studies in Brazil - A meta-analysis,"The objective of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis that compared the chemical composition of corn silage produced for different experimental purposes, i.e., by research groups that studied corn silage (SCS) or by research groups that only used corn silage (UCS) as a form of roughage. We analyzed 203 papers that were published between January 1994 and December 2014 and contained a total of 647 treatments and the analysis of 1701 silos. We found a significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the dry matter (DM) content of SCS silage (33.00%) and that of UCS silage (30.64%). The DM contents of neutral detergent fiber for the SCS and UCS silage were high (54.72 and 55.14% DM, respectively) but were not significantly different from one another (P = 0.5936), and the acid detergent fiber content of the UCS silage (31.04% DM) was higher than that of the SCS silage (29.65%, P = 0.0214), which indicated that the UCS silage was less digestible than the SCS silage. This was also corroborated (P = 0.0064) by the mean content of total digestible nutrients (64.18% DM) in the UCS silage, which likely results from the lower level of care taken when using standard silage production methods, compared to that taken by SCS researchers. Therefore, we concluded that the corn silage produced by research groups in Brazil are not analyzed in full and that, as a result, there is a paucity of important information, such as the content of organic acids. In addition, we also found that corn silage produced in Brazil contains a high level of neutral detergent fiber.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25966/20576,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The animals were split into two grazing groups: improved natural grassland (n = 47) and natural grassland (n = 44). The environment was found to influence all traits, and the highest measures of performance were observed in improved natural grassland. The genetic group x environment interaction was verified only for ADG and YW (P < 0.05). We found the best performance trait averages for crossbreeds of Bos taurus and Bos indicus.

38,2017,Fractionation of carbohydrates and nitrogenous constituents of late-crop corn silages ensiled with different specific masses,"The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of carbohydrates and nitrogenous fractions of late-crop corn silages with different specific masses (SM; 90, 134, 172, and 214 kg dry matter m-3). The silage was held in 20-L mini-silos, and the experimental design was completely randomized, with four replications (mini-silos) per treatment. Fractionation was performed according to The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPSv5.0). The SM of the silage significantly affected the contents of ether extract ( ? = 1.718 + 0.0041?SM; P = 0.009; R2 = 39.2), soluble sugars ( ? = 0.9502 - 0.003445?SM; P < 0.001; R2 = 59.9), and soluble fiber ( ? = -0.4731 + 0.01158?SM; P = 0.025; R2 = 31.2). In addition, SM also affected carbohydrate fraction B1 in a linear manner ( ? = 14.88 + 0.2566?SM; P = 0.043; R2 = 38.4), whereas the remaining fractions were unaffected. Furthermore, no change was observed in total N ( ? = 2.003 - 0.01065?SM + 0.000036?SM2; P = 0.041; R2 = 38.8), non-protein N ( ? = 1.436 - 0.01103?SM + 0.000036?SM2; P = 0.060; R2 = 35.1), soluble N ( ? = 1.715 - 0.01450?SM + 0.00005?SM2; P = 0.024; R2 = 43.8), or neutral detergent insoluble N ( ? = 0.4979 - 0.001057?SM; P < 0.001; R2 = 70.6). The results also contributed to the differences in fractions A ( ? = 66.47- 0.5291?SM + 0.00174?SM2; P = 0.095; R2 = 30.4), B2 ( ? = 6.78 + 0.05857?SM; P = 0.076; R2 = 20.8), and B3 (? = 19.03 - 0.05565?SM; P = 0.018, R2 = 34,1) of the Cornell model. In the present study, differences in the compression (i.e., SM) of corn silages caused changes in the contents of soluble sugar and nitrogenous constituents; however, SM alone did not explain the entire preservation of the ensiled material.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25856/20575,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Four identification methods (treatments) were compared: T1: ear tag in one ear and ear button in the other ear (eabu); T2: ear tag and iron brand on the right leg (eaib); T3: ear tag in one ear and tattoo on the other ear (eata); and T4: ear tag in one ear and electronic ear tag (eael) on the other. Each treatment was applied to 60 Nelore animals, totaling 240 animals, divided equally into three life stages (calves, young cattle, adult cattle). The study had two phases: implementation (phase 1) and reading and transfer of identification numbers to an electronic database (phase 2). All operating expenses related to the two phases of the study were determined. The database was constructed, and the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS® 17.0 software. Regarding the time spent on implementation (phase 1), conventional ear tags and electronic ear tags produced similar results, which were lower than those of hot iron and tattoo methods, which differed from each other. Regarding the time required for reading the numbers on animals and their transcription into a database (phase 2), electronic ear-tagging was the fastest method, followed by conventional ear tag, hot iron and tattoo. Among the methods analyzed, the electronic ear tag had the highest technical efficiency because it required less time to implement identifiers and to complete the process of reading and transcription to an electronic database and because it did not exhibit any errors. However, the cost of using the electronic ear-tagging method was higher primarily due to the cost of the device.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25801/20657,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Digestibility and performance of lambs fed diets containing old man saltbush hay,"The aim of this study was to evaluate feed intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, water balance, and performance of lambs fed diets containing old man saltbush hay associated with a concentrate. Thirty-two castrated feedlot Santa Inês lambs at approximately eight months of age, with 22 ± 1.97 kg body weight, were distributed into a completely randomized experimental design. Acid detergent fiber intake increased (P < 0.05), whereas non-fibrous carbohydrates intake decreased (P < 0.01). Inclusion of old man saltbush in the diet reduced (P < 0.01) the digestibility of dry and organic matter, neutral and acid detergent fiber, and non-fibrous carbohydrates. The intakes of digestible dry and organic matter, ether extract, total carbohydrates, and digestible non-fibrous carbohydrates also decreased (P < 0.01). Inclusion of old man saltbush did not influence water consumption from the trough by the sheep, averaging 4,327.20 mL/day?1. Body weight at slaughter and daily weight gain decreased linearly (P < 0.05) and feed conversion worsened as old man saltbush hay was added to the diet. Inclusion of old man saltbush at up to 40% replacing the concentrate in feedlot lamb diets does not compromise the performance of these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25773/20572,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Sorghum and black oat forage production and its nutritive value under phosphate levels,"Phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting mineral elements for biomass and grain production in tropical soils. This study was undertaken to assess the influence of P on herbage accumulation (DM) and the nutritive value of forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and black oat (Avena strigosa) in succession. Evaluated treatments were P fertilization levels of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg of P2O5 ha-1 distributed in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The treatments were applied at sorghum seeding in the summer 2010/2011 and 2011/2012. Black oat was seeded following sorghum in 2011 with no additional P fertilization. Herbage production and its nutritive value were assessed by successive cuts. The greatest sorghum DM yields were obtained at the highest phosphate level tested (200 kg P2O5 ha-1), with residual response in subsequent black oat. There was no effect of P fertilization levels on the nutritive values of both crops, considering crude protein (CP) levels, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), what demonstrates that P addition has no effect in forage nutritive value, especially when the soil P levels are classified as medium or high. The plant P recovery efficiency decreased when increasing P fertilization levels for both sorghum and black oat. The level of 50 kg P2O5 ha-1 year-1 presented the greatest P recovery by plants, which supports the idea of less fertilizer use with more efficiency.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25606/20570,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Spatial distribution of microregions specialized in milk production,"The aim of this study was to verify and characterizes the spatial distribution of the microregions specialized in bovine milk production in Paraná State, Brazil, using data from the Municipal Livestock Survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Central Bank of Brazil’s National Program to Strengthen Household Agriculture (PRONAF), from 2000 to 2012. Methodologically, we carry out location quotient (LQ), principal component, (PCA) and cluster analyses. Based on the results of the LQ, of the 39 microregions in Paraná State analyzed, 13 are identified as specializing in milk production. In particular, the West and Southwest mesoregions as well as the microregion of Ponta Grossa, in relative terms, account for 58% of the milk produced in the study period. Additionally, based on the PCA, 2 principal components are found to explain 91.5% of the variability in the data, termed technically enhanced production and household production. Finally, by using cluster analysis, five groups are identified among the microregions specializing in milk production, thus indicating marked heterogeneity across the state. This situation requires the expansion of public policies that mitigate regional disparities and provide the state with production gains from milk farming.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25656/20571,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Supplementation strategies for dairy cows kept in tropical grass pastures,"This study aimed to evaluate the supplementation strategies on forage intake and nutrient digestibility, feeding behavior, milk production and composition, feed efficiency, nitrogen balance and body weight change of dairy cows kept in Tanzania grass pastures (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzania) in the dry season. We used eight crossbred Holstein and Zebu cows in the final third of lactation, with an average weight of 505±44 kg and initial milk production of 9.0±1.44 kg day-1, in a double 4X4 Latin square design. The experiment consisted of four experimental periods of 17 days each, with nine days for initial adaptation and eight days to collect data. Treatments consisted of mineral mix and supplements (energy, protein or multiple) provided in the amount of 2 kg per cow day-1. Supplements promoted increased consumption of dry matter and nutrients (P < 0.05), without changing the forage intake in relation to the mineral mixture. The treatments did not affect the feeding behavior of animals (P > 0.05). There was an increase (P < 0.05) of 19.51% in milk production in the supplemented animals and productive responses approximate marginal 0.64 kg of milk for each kg of supplied supplement, however, the different supplements promoted a drop in the milk fat. There were higher net energy values of animal lactation for protein-energy supplementation and mineral mixture, but no change was observed in feed efficiency and energy efficiency. The performance of dairy cows kept in tropical grass pasture can be improved with the use of a concentrate supplementation of 0.40% of body weight per day-1 without compromising the forage intake of animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25604/20610,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Propolis residue inclusion in the diet affects digestive enzyme activity in broiler chickens,"This study investigated the effects of the inclusion of solid propolis residue (PR) from alcoholic propolis extraction in the diets of broiler chickens from 1 to 21-d of age on their performance, intestinal morphology, and digestive enzyme activity. 405 male chicks were distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments (inclusion of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4% PR in the diets), and three replications with 27 birds each. The birds were fed experimental diets from 1 to 21-d of age and basal diet from 22 to 42-d of age. Feed intake (from 1 to 21-d and 1 to 42-d of age) decreased linearly with increasing levels of PR inclusion (P < 0.05). Dietary inclusion of PR did not affect intestinal morphology at 7 and 21-d of age (P > 0.05). Pancreatic amylase activity presented a quadratic response at 7 and 21-d of age, with its lowest activity estimated at 2.45 and 1.91% PR inclusion, respectively. At 7-d of age, trypsin activity decreased linearly, whereas chymotrypsin activity varied quadratically, with its activity estimated at 2.06% PR inclusion. Intestinal maltase activity varied quadratically with lowest activity predicted at 1.57% PR inclusion at 21-d of age. The dietary inclusion of solid propolis residue of propolis decreases feed intake in broilers and modulates their intestinal and pancreatic enzyme activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25605/20569,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Allometric growth of body components in crossbred ewe lambs fed increasing dietary concentrate levels,"This study aimed to evaluate the growth of body components in crossbred ewe lambs fed increasing levels of dietary concentrate and to determine the optimum level of supplementation for finishing ewe production. Thirty crossbred (½ Pantaneira × ½ Texel) wool ewe lambs fed Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.) and different dietary concentrate levels (20, 40, 60, and 80% DM basis) were selected for study. At the beginning of the study, six animals were slaughtered for determination of initial body composition. The remaining animals were slaughtered at approximately 48 kg live weight. The growth of body components in relation to body growth was estimated from the allometric model BC = a × (FBW)b, where BC is body component weight, a and b are growth equation parameters, and FBW is fasted body weight. Carcass, muscle, bone, and gastrointestinal tract were late maturing (b < 1, P < 0.01). Carcass and carcass fat growth was positively affected (linear, P < 0.05) by concentrate level. Total fat weight increased with increasing concentrate level (P < 0.05). The addition of up to 60% concentrate in growing ewe lamb diets is recommended for production of carcasses with early deposition of muscle and fat. The addition of 20% concentrate in ewe lab diets is sufficient for production of carcasses with maximum deposition of muscle and no excess fat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25339/20605,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of season on haircoat characteristics and physiological parameters of Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá crossed heifers,"This study aimed to investigate haircoat characteristics and physiological parameters in summer and winter, morning and afternoon periods, of Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá crossed heifers in tropical environment. For this, twenty crossbred dairy heifers (Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá), reared in the city of Ibiá, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Haircoat thickness, i.e. distance from skin surface until hairend, average hair length, number of hairs per unit area, hair angle to the skin surface, cardiac and respiratory rates, rectal and body surface temperatures were measured. Data underwent analysis of variance and the means were compared by F test at 5% significance, except heart and respiratory rates and skin temperature within the season, which were compared by Mann Whitney test at 5%. For rectal temperature, the maximum value found was 39.53 °C in the summer afternoon. In the afternoon, rectal temperature was higher in summer compared to winter. Respiratory and heart rates and coat surface temperature were higher in the summer (34.00 movements min-1; 78.60 beats min-1; 37.97 °C respectively) compared to the winter (27.47 movements minutes -1; 58.72 beats min-1; 34,94ºC, respectively). Haircoat thickness and hair length were larger in winter (0.73; 1.82 cm, respectively) compared to summer (0.49; 1.11 cm, respectively). We concluded that the season of the year and day period interfere with most of the physiological parameters for thermoregulation and haircoat characteristics of crossbred heifers (Holstein-Gyr x Guzerá); however, they keep homeothermy, therefore are adapted to the region, and may be an alternative to be used by farmers of this region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24875/20566,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Supplementation of sheep with increasing levels of crude protein: performance, animal behavior, and contamination and spread of nematode larvae in Brachiaria brizantha ‘Xaraés’ pasture","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance, animal behavior, and contamination and spread of nematode larvae of sheep supplemented with increasing levels of protein (15, 25, and 35%) on Xaraés grass (Brachiaria brizantha ‘Xaraés’) pastures. Fifteen Santa Inês crossbred sheep, with an average age of approximately five months and average initial weight of 14.63 kg, were used in the experiment. The feeding behavior (grazing and idle times) of animals was found to be influenced by the supplementation provided. The highest level of supplementation provided to the animals reduced their grazing time. The different levels of supplementation influenced the average daily gain and total final body weight gain of the sheep in Xaraés grass pastures. A significant difference was observed in the presence of parasitic larvae in the Xaraés grass pastures depending on different protein levels throughout the regrowth period. The number of larvae in feces was influenced by the protein content of the supplement, and varied throughout the pasture rest period. Animals showed a decrease in the number of larvae as their dietary crude protein (CP) content was increased. Supplementation with high protein, together with the action of vermifuge, increased the performance of sheep and reduced their parasite load and grazing time in Xaraés grass pastures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23987/20565,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment was performed in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized factorial design using two types of biofertilizers and five dosages (0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10% of soil volume), with four repeats, for the duration of two vegetative cycles. In the first cycle, there was an increase in leaf lifespan and leaf/stem ratio with the use of 10% and 7.5% caprine biofertilizer, respectively. From the second cycle, doses of biofertilizers between 7.5% and 10% led to an improvement in the development of the morphogenic variables - leaf sprouting rate, leaf and pseudostem elongation rate, leaf lifespan, and senescence, as well as the structural characteristics - expanded leaf length and width, number of sprouting, expanded and live leaves, and expanded/expanding leaf ratio, resulting in a 73% increase in biomass. It was concluded that the use of biofertilizers improves the main morphogenic and structural characteristics of Cenchrus ciliaris L., resulting in increased fodder mass yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23777/20564,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Productive characteristics of the grass Digitaria umfolozi subjected to defoliation frequencies,"An experiment was carried out to evaluate the dry matter production, total dry matter availability, daily dry matter accumulation rate, light interception, leaf area index, daily accumulation rate, dry matter availability of the morphological components (leaf blades, stems + sheaths and dead material), leaf/stem ratio, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre of Faixa-Brancagrass under seven defoliation frequencies (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days). Longer defoliation frequencies reduced the percentage of leaf blades and increased the percentage of stems + sheaths. The defoliation frequency positively influenced the availability of leaf blades, stems + sheaths, dead material and total dry matter. In the range of 42 days of defoliation, light interception reached 95%. At frequencies of 14 and 21 days of defoliation, the crude protein content of the leaves was above 20%. The highest utilization efficiency of D. umfolozi grass is achieved when the forage is managed with cutting intervals of 40 to 46 days. Higher defoliation frequencies positively contribute to the increase in the number of total white band grass leaves and higher crude protein content of the leaf blades and stems + sheaths.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19602/20603,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Production and nutritional value of the wheat silage managed with different cutting systems,"Winter cereals are mainly used for human and animal nutrition and several studies are now exploring their potential as conserved forage (hay and silage). Among the winter cereal species available for cultivation in the south of Brazil, which is major winter cereals producer in the country, the wheat cv. BRS Umbu has attracted special attention. However, few studies have investigated the potential of this cultivar for silage production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the production and quality of silage from the dual-purpose wheat, BRS Umbu, subjected to different cut managements treatments: T1 - without cut (control), T2 - one cut and T3 - two cuts. Each plot represented an experimental unit in a randomized block design, with 5 replicates per treatment. Two representative samples were collected from each plot to determine morphological segmentation (stem, leaf and ear) and dry matter (DM) content of the whole plant and its morphological components. At the time of opening of the silos, food chemical analysis and pH determination were performed. Forage mass production decreased by 26.88% and 67.82%, respectively, with one and two cuts, compared to control. The DM content of the ensiled plant was 49.9 g kg-1 for the control, 54.7 g kg-1 with one cut and 63.2 g kg-1 with two cuts, at the time of ensiling. Management cuts changed the morphological components of the plants, with a lower proportion of stem (28%) in plants subjected to two cuts. The control treatment showed fewer leaves in ensiled plant (9.6%) and intermediate amount of stalk (52.8%), and was significantly different (p < 0.05) to treatment of a cut. Regarding feed chemistry evaluations, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed for mineral matter (MM), crude protein (CP) and hemicellulose (HEM) between the different cutting regimens. However, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) decreased (p < 0.05) as the number of cuts increased. The control treatment showed higher NDF and ADF content (563.2 and 357.9 g kg-1 DM, respectively) and lower amount of total digestible nutrients (TDN) and net energy of lactation (NEL). However, the estimated milk production (EMP) was superior for this treatment (22,447 l ha-1), demonstrating the high impact of reduced forage mass production with increased number of cuts.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/19579/20562,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Neospora caninum: Seroprevalence in beef cattle in the mountainous region of Santa Catarina, Brazil","The distribution of Neospora caninum, an important agent of reproductive disorders in cattle, has been frequently reported in dairy cattle in Brazil and worldwide. Records of infection are less frequent in beef cattle. To determine the seroprevalence of bovine neosporosis, 507 beef cattle blood samples were collected from January 2013 to September 2015, from 16 municipalities of the Associação dos Municípios da Região Serrana (AMURES). Samples were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies ( ? 1:100) against N. caninum by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Information about sex, age, and origin of the bovines were obtained from the Brazilian Bovine and Bubaline Identification and Certification System (SISBOV), and were tabulated for statistical analysis (Chi-square and Fisher Exact test, P ? 0.05). Of the 507 serum samples analyzed, 70 (13.81%) contained antibodies against N. caninum with titers of 1:100 (16), 1:200 (22), 1:400 (17), 1:800 (nine), 1:1600 (four) and 1:3200 (two). Positive specimens were collected from 13 of the 16 municipalities and across all age groups. Of the positive samples, there were no statistical differences between males and females (32.86% vs. 67.14%, P= 0.1072), age groups (P= 0.4116), or municipalities (P= 0.6838). While not statistically significant (P>0.05), higher seroprevalence was observed among older females. Although seroprevalence was relatively low, results indicate that infection by N. caninum in beef cattle is widespread in the studied region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25365/20519,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Bovine respiratory disease associated with Histophilus somni and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in a beef cattle feedlot from Southeastern Brazil,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a complex multifactorial and multi-etiological disease entity that is responsible for the morbidity and mortality particularly in feedlot cattle from North America. Information relative to the occurrence of BRD in Brazil and the associated infectious agents are lacking. This study investigated the participation of infectious agents of BRD in a beef cattle feedlot from Southeastern Brazil. Nasopharyngeal swabs of 11% (10/90) of cattle (n, 450) with clinical manifestations of respiratory distress were analyzed by targeting specific genes of the principal infectious pathogens of BRD. In addition, pulmonary fragments of one the animals that died were collected for histopathological and molecular diagnoses. The nucleic acids of Histophilus somni and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were identified in 20% (2/10) of the nasopharyngeal swabs of the animals with respiratory distress; another contained only BRSV RNA. Moreover, the nucleic acids of both infectious agents were amplified from the pulmonary fragments of the animal that died with histopathological evidence of bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia; the nasopharyngeal swab of this animal also contained the nucleic acids of both pathogens. Additionally, all PCR and/or RT-PCR assays designed to detect the specific genes of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus -1, bovine parainfluenza virus-3, and bovine coronavirus yielded negative results. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the isolates of H. somni circulating in Brazil are similar to those identified elsewhere, while there seem to be diversity between the isolates of BRSV within cattle herds from different geographical locations of Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25499/20670,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Thermoduric psychrotrophic proteolytic microbiota from refrigerated raw milk,"Thermoduric microorganisms may withstand high temperatures during the pasteurization of milk. Therefore, the microbiota in pasteurized milk consist of thermoduric microbes and directly influence the shelf-life of the milk. The aim of this study was to identify thermoduric psychrotrophic proteolytic microbiota in refrigerated raw milk. Twenty samples, previously heat-treated, were streaked and incubated at 7°C for 10 days. The strains isolated were streaked on milk agar to assess proteolytic activity and were initially analyzed morphologically by light microscopy and then by molecular techniques to identify the species. In 40% of the samples analyzed was observed only one bacterial growth and others 10 thermoduric psychrotrophic fungi. All isolates were proteolytic. The sequencing of 16S rRNA gene identified the bacterial strain as Bacillus pumilus and analysis of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of fungal isolates revealed the Cladosporium cladosporioides (60%), Curvularia geniculatus (10%), and the 3 remaining strains were identified as Geotrichum candidum (30%). This is a fist description of B. pumilus in Brazilian raw milk. Considering the spoilage potential of all isolates and of the fungi present in raw milk and their survival in pasteurized milk, it is extremely important to carry out further studies to your resistant to heat, their impact on the shelf-life of pasteurized milk, ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk and dairy products.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25121/20507,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Blood samples from 734 dairy cattle on 41 farms were collected at two different times: in 2012, 406 animals on 30 farms were used; and in 2014, 329 animals on 31 farms. Serum samples were obtained and were used to detect antibodies against N. caninum, by means of the indirect fluorescence assay (IFA). Animals with titers ? 100 were considered positive. The total serum prevalence of anti-N. caninum antibodies was 19.7% (145/736) among all the dairy cattle, comprising 23.1% (94/406) in 2012 and 15.5% (51/329) in 2014. Serum from 91 animals was tested in both trials: 11(12.1%) showed positivity in 2012 and 10 (11%) in 2014. The variables of age, sex and breed did not show any associations with seropositivity. Thus, we showed that the cattle in this settlement presented high levels of antibodies against N. caninum, and that IFA showed good efficacy for epidemiological studies.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24600/20516,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"A serological survey of agents causing leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis in Rattus rattus in the city of Umuarama, northwest Paraná, Brazil","Synanthropic rodents, present in both urban and rural areas, are responsible for the zoonotic transmission of several diseases to humans as well as for significant economic losses. They act as reservoirs for important viral diseases, bacterial diseases such as leptospirosis, and parasitic diseases such as toxoplasmosis and leishmaniasis. The aim of the present study was to assess the seropositivity of synanthropic rodents in Umuarama city, located in the northwestern region of Paraná State, Brazil, to agents causing leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis. The microscopic agglutination technique (MAT) was used to detect anti-Leptospira antibodies, and the indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IIFR) was used to detect anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. Of 178 animals collected, four (2.24%) were seropositive for Leptospira spp. and ten (5.62%) for Toxoplasma gondii. Ninety-five (53.38%) of the collected animals were male and 83 (46.62%) were female, and two (1.23%) originated from urban areas while 176 (98.87%) originated from peri-urban areas. Serological results showed that the synanthropic rodents examined here had low seroreactivity for agents causing both leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis, in both urban and peri-urban regions of Umuarama city. This could be associated with the high Human Development Index for the study area. However, preventative measures must continue to be observed, as rodents are important reservoirs for, and disseminators of, disease causing agents.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23337/20515,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Collagen quantification in rabbit dermal wounds treated with heterologous platelet-rich plasma gel,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been extensively studied as a biomaterial for wound treatment, and the heterologous PRP is usefulin the event that obtaining the patient’s own blood is impossible. This study aimed to evaluate and compare wound healing in rabbits and quantify the collagen in experimentally induced wounds in a control group and in a group treated with heterologous PRP gel. We hypothesize that this gelis capable of promoting proper healing with no adverse reactions, increased collagen content. The clinical aspects of coloring, edema, hyperemia, exudation, crust, granulation, pain sensitivity, and retraction index of the wounds were measuredon days 7, 14, and 17 after the injury. Collagen quantification by Picrosirius staining and evaluation under polarized light was performed on the 17th day. Crust was present in both groups at all evaluated time points, with the absence of other clinical signs. The wound contraction rate and collagen quantity did not differ between groups. In conclusion, the suggested hypothesis was partially confirmed; the heterologous PRP gel was unable to increase the amount of collagen and accelerate the wound healing process, however, wound healing was efficient and similar in both groups and there was no local adverse reaction. Thus, despite the scarcity of studies in the literature, the heterologous PRP gel is an effective alternative treatment for wounds in the absence of other sources of PRP.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24508/22162,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Haemonchus contortus resistance to monepantel in sheep: fecal egg count reduction tests and randomized controlled trials,"Worm infections are a major cause of economic losses in sheep farming, and their control depends essentially on anthelmintic drugs. After decades without the discovery of new drug types, a new class of anthelmintics, called aminoacetonitrile derivatives, represented by monepantel, was released on the market. In order to evaluate a report of low efficacy of monepantel on a sheep farm in the municipality of Taiúva, state of São Paulo, Brazil, fecal egg count reduction and critical tests were performed on a Haemonchus contortus strain collected from this farm. To this end, ten animals were experimentally infected with 5000 H. contortus third-stage larvae, and these animals were divided into two groups, control and treated, according to the treatment with monepantel. The parameters evaluated were reduction in fecal egg counts on post-treatment days (PTD) 0, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and the therapeutic efficacy at the end of this period. Egg count reduction was observed starting on PTD 2, with a maximum reduction of 32.89% recorded on PTD 14. The critical test revealed 24.65% efficacy, indicating resistance to the active ingredient monepantel. The ineffectiveness of monepantel may be associated with the excessive use of the anthelmintic, which the farmer administered at intervals of less than one month, without technical guidance or a defined criterion. Given that the anthelmintic was used on this farm for less than one year, according to the farmer, it can be inferred that H. contortus develops resistance to monepantel in a few generations if the product is used incorrectly.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23164/20527,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Comparative neurotoxicity of iobitridol with iohexol by intracisternal administration in Wistar rats,"Iobitridol is a tri-iodinated contrast agent, and neurotoxicologic studies of the intracisternal administration are scarce and inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to compare the neurotoxicity of iobitridol with iohexol, by intracisternal administration in Wistar rats, for a pre-clinical evaluation of its use as a myelographic agent. The animals, a total of 75, were divided into three experimental groups, iobitridol, iohexol and cerebral artificial fluid (control group), with 25 animals per group. Then, these were divided into five subgroups of five animals each, and given doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg kg-1, while the control group received the equivalent volumes of contrast media tested. The animals were evaluated after 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min of intracisternal administration of these substances, for signs of depression and excitement, tactile palmar grasp, flexor, extensor, palpebral, papillary and pinna reflexes, surface righting and placing reactions, and with an auditory startle test. The evaluations were assessed daily for seven days with these parameters and their body weight, food, and water intake were also measured. There were no statistically significant differences between groups tested with respect to any of the evaluated parameters. In other words, in this animal model, the iobitridol demonstrated a low neurotoxicologic potential, comparable to that observed with iohexol. Further study with dogs and cats, as an alternative, is suggested.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22640/20494,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Cardiorespiratory and electrocardiographic effects of methadone or morphine in the perioperative period in anesthetized dogs with continuous rate infusion of propofol and submitted to ovariohysterectomy,"The aims of this study were compare the electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiopulmonary effects of methadone or morphine, both injected intravenously (IV) in dogs anesthetized with continuous infusion of propofol. Sixteen healthy female mongrel dogs were used in this study for elective ovariohysterectomy. The animals were allocated in random order into two groups assigned GME (methadone 0.3 mg kg-1, IV) or GMO (morphine 0.3 mg kg-1, IV). Parameters were evaluated: heart rate (HR), P-wave amplitude (Ps and PmV), interval between Ps and R waves (PR), QRS duration (QRS), R-wave amplitude (R), duration the interval between the Q and T waves (QT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), end tidal of carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and periferic oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2). Postoperative analgesia was assessed by mechanical nociceptive stimulus based on the scale proposed by Firth and Haldane (1999) and rescue analgesia based on the visual analogue scale. HR was lower in GME in relation to GMO. The P, PmV, PR, QRS, R and QT values remained within their normality tracks, showing no clinical importance. Apnea and ETCO2 increased in both groups. There was no difference between groups of the analgesic effects. It can be concluded that methadone and morphine promote similar cardiovascular effects after IV injection during surgery in dogs anesthetized with propofol by continuous rate infusion, however, when methadone used, assisted ventilation is required. In addition, both drugs promote postoperative analgesia until six hours.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21245/20493,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Sensory and chemical properties of peanut grains (Arachis hypogaea L) roasted in microwave or oven,"Peanut grains are an excellent source of proteins and lipids. Before consumption, peanuts are subjected to a roasting process to acquire desirable sensory characteristics, in addition to eliminating microorganisms present. However, this processing step can cause various changes in lipid and protein fraction of grains, which are not totally elucidated in the literature. This study evaluated parameters such as the lipid acidity, peroxide value, primary (K232) and secondary (K270) products of lipid oxidation, fatty acid profile, reducing sugars, browning index, protein solubility, protein content and intention to purchase of peanut kernels with four colors of testa (striped, rose, red and black), subjected to the roasting process in microwave or oven. After processing, there was a reduction in lipid acidity and unsaturated fatty acids and an increase in saturated fatty acids, peroxide value, K232 and K270 in oil. There was a reduction in protein solubility and reducing sugars, with an increase in browning index. The purchase intention was higher for microwave-roasted red and rose peanut grains, which makes this form of processing interesting due to its convenience and speed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25305/20492,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Mechanical properties of baru fruit (Dipteryx alata Vogel),"This paper aimed to verify the influence of moisture content and drying temperature on the values of maximum compression strength for fixed strains (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; and 7 mm), rupture force, and proportional deformity modulus on the baru fruit (Dipteryx alata Vogel) under compression in a natural resting position. Baru fruits with a moisture content ranging from 0.333 to 0.053 (decimal dry basis - db) were used. The fruits were uniaxially compressed between two parallel plates, in the natural resting position, and the nuts were dried at temperatures of 60, 80, and 100 °C. The reduction in the moisture content during drying was monitored using a gravimetric method (weight loss) to determine the initial moisture content of the product and the final moisture content. Based on our results, the compression force needed to deform the baru fruit decreased with increasing moisture content, regardless of the drying temperature. The proportional deformity modulus increased with the reduction of moisture content for all the studied temperatures. The reduced moisture content increased the force required to rupture the baru fruit, regardless of the drying temperature. The rupture forces of temperatures of 60 to 100 °C may be represented by one model.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25277/20491,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Microbiological evaluation of lettuce produced by conventional and organic systems in farms of Londrina, PR","The aims of this study were to evaluate the contamination of lettuce (Lactuca sativa), produced in Londrina, Paraná (PR), with total coliform, coliform at 45 °C, E. coli, and Salmonella spp.; and to determine the E. coli contamination of irrigation water used at the farms studied. Four farms were evaluated, of which three produced lettuce using a conventional system and one using an organic system. An evaluation of the production practices of the farms was also carried out. A total of 111 samples were analyzed, 71 lettuce samples from the conventional system and 40 samples from the organic system. A total of eight irrigation water samples were collected for analysis. Coliform at 45 °C counts above the limit tolerated by Brazilian legislation were observed in 2.8% (2/71) of conventionally grown lettuce samples, and Salmonella spp. was isolated in 1.4% (1/71) of those samples. In the organic lettuce samples, 12.5% (5/40) had coliform at 45 °C counts above the limit tolerated and Salmonella spp. was not detected. Irrigation water samples from three farms were unsatisfactory, with counts higher than 102MPN of E. coli per 100mL. The results of this study demonstrate that most conventionally grown lettuce samples show good sanitary conditions in production, and that lettuce contamination is not related to contamination found in irrigation water samples. The results also showed that the organic production practices required by Brazilian certification agencies should be applied to ensure that contamination of produced lettuce remains controlled.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24889/20488,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Effect of termite activity on soil under different land management strategies,"Mound-building termites are important agents of soil bioperturbation, but these species have not been extensively studied thus far. The present study aimed to evaluate the soil particle-size and the chemical attributes of termite mounds and the surrounding soil under different land use strategies. A one-hectare plot was defined for an unmanaged degraded pasture, planted pasture, and for a eucalyptus Corymbia citriodora plantation. In each plot, the top, center, and base sections of five Cornitermes cumulans mounds, and the surrounding soil at the depths of 0-5; 5-10; 10-20 cm, were sampled in the Pinheiral, Rio de Janeiro state. In the three areas, the center of the mounds contained higher clay content, organic carbon, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium, total bases, and cation exchangeable capacity, when compared to the top, base, and the surrounding soils. However, the center had lower values of exchangeable acidity and potassium, of the three areas. In the eucalyptus plantation, the values of pH, total bases, calcium, and magnesium were lower, whereas aluminum, exchangeable acidity, sodium, and cation exchange capacity were higher both in the mounds and in the surrounding soil, in relation to the pastures. There were no differences among the three areas in terms of organic carbon, potassium, phosphorous, and total bases, in the mounds and adjacent soil. Thus, the termite activity altered the clay content and most of the soil chemical properties in all of the studied areas, but only for the center of the mounds. However, the effect of these organisms was different in the eucalyptus plantation in relation to the pasture areas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23899/20485,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The municipalities focused for current research are Bandeirantes, Cambará, Santo Antônio da Platina, Andirá, Cornélio Procópio and Itambaracá, within the meso-region of the so-called Pioneer Northern Region of the state of Paraná, Brazil. Three hundred and forty-six structured questionnaires with seventeen multiple choice objective questions, featuring qualitative and quantitative variables, were handed out. Results show that 92% of the interviewed people ate fish; 55% earned more than three Brazilian minimum wages; 41% went to secondary school and 66% of the families comprised between three and five members. Mean fish consumption reached 18 kg/inhab/year; 54% of interviewed were over 40 years old; 37% preferred fish fillet; mostly prepared as fried fish. Moreover, the main obstacles for increase in consumption for 53% of the interviewed were high prices and non-availability of the product. The supermarket was the preferred place for purchase. Consumers in the Pioneer Northern Region of the Paraná have a relevant preference for fish, with a high capacity for per capita consumption increase even though supply and prices are strategic issues which require investigation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24877/20655,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Canopy growth and productivity of Jatropha genotypes,"Information of jatropha genotypes yield are scarce, but necessary to promote the crop establishment, so it is very important for the commercial planting of this crop. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the canopy growth and productivity of three jatropha genotypes. The experimental design was a randomized block, with 15 treatments, three replications and five plants per plot. The jatropha genotypes were selected because they have some special characteristics: (CNPAE-107 - small size, CNPAE-133 - productive and CNPAE-169 - seeds without toxicity) obtained in the Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Agroenergy, Brasília, DF, Brazil. The data were collected for five cycles of production. We evaluated: grain yield; height and canopy volume. Treatments differ in all characteristics. Jatropha grain yield has been growing along the first four years of evaluation, however, in the fifth year production was lower when compared to the fourth year. The most productive genotype was CNPAE-133 (2123.8 Kg ha-1 year), followed by CNPAE-107 genotypes (2076.5 Kg ha-1 year) and CNPAE-169 (913 Kg ha-1 year), the highest yields were obtained at 3.7 years.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23882/20484,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Dormancy overcoming, temperatures and substrates on germination of Mimosa tenuiflora Willd seeds","Mimosa tenuiflora Willd., popularly known as jurema-preta, is an arboreal species of great importance for the brazilian Northeast due to its uses as a medicinal plant and in the restoration of degraded soils. No information is available in the Rules for Seed Analysis and the Instructions for Seed Analysis of Forest Species regarding ideal conditions for of this species. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of pre-germination treatments, in addition to verifying the germination performance at different temperatures and in different substrates. In both experiments, four replicates of 25 seeds were used for each treatment. In experiment I, seeds were submitted to the following methods for overcoming dormancy: witness - Intact seeds (T1) immersion in water at 100 °C for 1 (T2), 2 (T3), 3 (T4), 4 (T5), 5 (T6) and 6 min (T7), immersion in concentrated sulfuric acid for 1 (T8), 4 (T9), 7 (T10), 10 (T11) and 13 min (T12), scarification on sandpaper n° 80 (T13) and lopping in the region opposite the micropyle (T14). In experiment II, seed germination was evaluated in four types of substrates: between sand, paper on, paper roll and between vermiculite and at six different temperatures: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 °C and alternating between 20 and 30 °C. Immersion in hot water for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 min, sulfuric acid treatment for 10 and 13 min, sand paper and lopping were the most appropriate treatments to overcome seed dormancy. The seed germination of M. Tenuiflora should be carried out at 25 °C on paper roll substrate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23709/20654,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Mapping of slopes for the operation of agricultural harvesters in Bandeirantes Municipality (PR),"The slope of terrain represents a risk factor for mechanized harvesting, leading to impediments or restrictions on agricultural operations, or even to machines toppling over in the field. Recently, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) has become widely adopted as one of the most viable techniques for obtaining slope and elevation. Therefore, this study aims to assess methods of acquiring DTMs to calculate the slope, and to determine the areas that are suitable and unsuitable for the operation of harvesters in the municipality of Bandeirantes (PR). Four methods were selected to produce DTMs for the construction of slope zoning maps applicable for harvester operations. The image sources included SRTM, ASTER GDEM, digitizing contour lines and kriging of spatial point data. After generating DTMs by the four different methods, the area suitable for the operation of harvesters was obtained based on the limits of operational slopes for harvesters in the literature. The high-resolution images, such as those obtained by scanning the contour lines and ASTER GDEM gave the best representation of the ground surface. Regardless of the method used to obtain the operational slopes, the municipality has a large area that is suitable for mechanized harvesting.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23612/20481,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,"Size, chlorophyll retention and protein and oil contents of grains from soybean plants grown in different spatial arrangements","The spatial arrangement of soybean plants, determined by row spacing and seeding rate, affects the intraspecific competition for water, light, and nutrients, as well as plant architecture and grain development, quality, and chemical composition. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of row spacing and seeding rate on the grain size produced, and the influence of these three factors on chlorophyll retention and protein and oil content in grain. Two experiments were conducted in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 growing seasons, using a 4 × 3 factorial randomized block design with three replications. Four different row spacings [20 cm (narrow row), 50 cm (conventional), 20/80 cm (twin rows) and crossed lines (50 cm)] and three seeding rates (150, 300, and 450 thousand viable seeds ha-1) were evaluated. The grains were classified by size using oblong sieves and then the effects of spatial arrangements and size of grain on the percentage of green grains and protein and oil contents were evaluated. Higher plant densities were associated with larger grain size, whereas the effects of spacing between the rows on the grain size varied between growing seasons. The arrangement in cross-rows and high plant density produced a higher percentage of green grains under weather conditions favorable to the development of this attribute. The effects of plant spatial arrangements on the contents of protein and oil in grains were variable, and it was not possible to determine whether the spatial arrangement of plants had an effect on the levels of protein and oil in grains. Larger grains had higher protein content, but oil contents were not affected by grain size.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23582/20480,E-ISSN 1679-0359

38,2017,Genetic diversity in soybean seed quality under different storage conditions,"This study aimed to assess the effect of genetic diversity on physiological quality of soybean seeds stored in cold chamber and under environmental conditions. Ten cultivars were assessed in a randomized factorial design (2x10). Factor 1 corresponded to two storage conditions and factor 2 to ten soybean cultivars, with four replications. The evaluated variables were total germination (G%), first count of germination (F%), percentage of abnormal seedlings (AS%), germination speed index (GSI), water content (WC), electrical conductivity (EC), dry matter of seedlings (DMS) and length of seedlings (LS). Data underwent ANOVA, followed by Scott Knott test, as well as multivariate analysis of genetic diversity. The results showed a higher physiological quality for seeds under cold storage. Half of the cultivars (FPS Júpiter, FPS Urano, FPS Antares, FPS Netuno and CD 250) presented high germination rates and seed vigor, being thus indicated as high-standard materials for further breeding programs. Besides that, storage environment had influence on the clustering of soybean cultivars.

38,2017,Photosynthetic activity of young Ricinus communis L. plants under conditions of flooded soil,"Soil flooding is a stress condition that causes changes in hydric relationships and in the metabolism of crops, thereby affecting their productivity. To evaluate the effects of soil flooding on the chlorophyll a fluorescence transient, as well as gas exchange and Ricinus communis growth, young plants of the ‘AL Guarany 2002’ and ‘IAC Guarani’ cultivars, grown in a greenhouse, were subjected to flood conditions by maintaining a layer of water 2-3 cm above the soil. The stressed plants showed drastic reduction in net CO2 assimilation and growth variables. There was, however, an increase in performance index (PIABS e PITOTAL) at different moments of stress between the two cultivars. In general, R. communis plants possess mechanisms to protect the electron transport chain during a period of stress, without causing damage and reducing functionality. However, this is not enough to maintain photosynthetic activity owing to the decrease in stomatal conductance and intrinsic carboxylation efficiency, which affects biomass accumulation in stressed plants. In summary, this study found that the ‘AL Guarany 2002’ was found to be more sensitive to stress than the ‘IAC Guarani’ was.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23518/20479,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Improvement of antioxidant activities and yield of spring maize through seed priming and foliar application of plant growth regulators under heat stress conditions,"Heat stress during reproductive and grain filling phases adversely affects the growth of cereals through reduction in grain’s number and size. However, exogenous application of antioxidants, plant growth regulators and osmoprotectants may be helpful to minimize these heat induced yield losses in cereals. This two year study was conducted to evaluate the role of exogenous application of ascorbic acid (AsA), salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) applied through seed priming or foliar spray on biochemical, physiological, morphological and yield related traits, grain yield and quality of late spring sown hybrid maize. The experiment was conducted in the spring season of 2007 and 2008. We observed that application of AsA, SA and H2O2 applied through seed priming or foliar spray improved the physiological, biochemical, morphological and yield related traits, grain yield and grain quality of late spring sown maize in both years. In both years, we observed higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activity in the plants where AsA, SA and H2O2were applied through seed priming or foliar spray than control. Membrane stability index (MSI), relative water contents (RWC), chlorophyll contents, grain yield and grain oil contents were also improved by exogenous application of AsA, SA and H2O2 in both years. Seed priming of AsA, SA and H2O2was equally effective as the foliar application. In conclusion, seed priming with AsA, SA and H2O2 may be opted to lessen the heat induced yield losses in late sown spring hybrid maize. Heat tolerance induced by ASA, SA and H2O2 may be attributed to increase in antioxidant activities and MSI which maintained RWC and chlorophyll contents in maize resulting in better grain yield in heat stress conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22576/20477,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Physicochemical quality of early-maturing ‘Navel’ sweet oranges,"The cultivation of new types of oranges can be a good alternative for citrus growers because there is a growing domestic market and good export prospects. Due to these expectations, it is essential to search for new cultivars for use in the fresh fruit industry. Therefore, the aim of this work was to physicochemically characterize the fruits of new cultivars of ‘Navel’ oranges, seeking alternatives with good characteristics, such as earliness, lack of seeds, good color and organoleptic characteristics desired by the consumer market. The fruits of five new cultivars of ‘Navel’ orange were evaluated, namely, ‘Bahia Valente’ (CN 28), ‘Golden Nugget Navel’ (CN 41), ‘‘Robertson Navel’’ (CN 39), ‘Washington Navel’ (CV 27) and ‘Washington Navel I’ (CN 34), during two harvest seasons (2012/2013 and 2013/2014). The following physicochemical variables were quantified: mass, peel color, juice yield, acidity, soluble solids and ratio. The cultivars studied were compared to the commercial cultivar ‘Bahia Cabula’ (CV 25). The new cultivars produced fruit with standards that met consumer expectations, with fruit mass suitable for sale of the fresh fruit, good yield juice and early maturation (March), which enables harvesting ‘Bahia Cabula’ in the off-season period. Thus, it is concluded that there are navel orange cultivars with acceptable physicochemical qualities and early maturation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23313/20476,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Biodegradable polymer nanofiber membrane for the repair of cutaneous wounds in dogs - two case reports,"The study of wound healing and its treatment is extremely important in veterinary medicine due to the high frequency of wounds and the difficulty in treating wounds by second intention. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a nanofiber membrane made of biodegradable polymers as a method of wound treatment in dogs. This study comprised two dogs with bite wounds. Debridement and cleaning was performed followed by the application of the membrane. In one dog, the wound was in the left proximal calcaneal region with clinical signs of infection, necrotic tissue, and muscle and the gastrocnemius tendon were exposed. The wound displayed rapid formation of granulation tissue which became excessive, so it was necessary to debride several times. However, with the suspension of the use of the membrane, formation of this tissue was not observed, and the wound evolved to epithelialization and fast contraction. In the second dog, there was a deep wound on the medial aspect of the proximal right hind limb, with clinical signs of infection, with muscle exposure. Once the membrane was placed, granulation tissue formed, and the membrane was used until the level of this tissue reached the skin. The wound underwent rapid epithelialization and contraction, without developing exuberant granulation tissue. Efficient wound repair was observed and the dogs exhibited greater comfort during application and use of the membrane. More studies should be conducted in dogs focusing on the application of this membrane until the appearance of healthy granulation tissue, as continued use seems to stimulate the formation of exuberant granulation tissue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21612/20071,E-ISSN 1679-0359
38,2017,Physiological performance of cagaita seeds (Eugenia dysenterica DC.) Subjected to drying,"The present study aimed to determine the imbibition curve and evaluate the effects of ‘reducing the water content of cagaita seeds (Eugenia dysenterica DC.), using the radiographic image analysis technique. To this end, three assays were carried out: seed imbibition curve and root protrusion were determined in assay 1. Seeds in silica gel were oven dried for to 72 h and were then analyzed for water content and vigor in assay 2. Seeds were dried up to certain levels of the water content and were evaluated by radiographic imaging analysis in assay 3. A rapid mass gain was observed in the first 60 imbibition hours and the root protrusion reached 94.4% after 192 imbibition hours. Cagaita seeds did not tolerate drying periods longer than 24 h, which corroborates the recalcitrant behavior of the seeds of these species. The analysis of the radiographic image obtained by an X-ray test allowed the establishment of a direct relation between the increased free space area within the seed and the decrease in the seedling emergence. The drying process altered the internal morphology of the seed and such changes directly influenced the development of the seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22956/20475,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of the growth, yield, and quality of floral stems of Heliconia psittacorum × H. spathocircinata ‘Golden Torch’ grown under different light conditions. The treatments consisted of four conditions: blue photoconversion screens (35%-40%); red photoconversion screens (18%-21%); black shading screens (45%-49%), and full sunlight. The experiment consisted of two parts. In the first, growth was assessed, whereas in the second, aspects related to the production and quality of floral stems were examined. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with split plots in time. Each plot contained six blocks, with 11 replications per block, giving a total of 66 pots per plot. The evaluations were performed at 30-day intervals over a 6-month period. In the analysis of growth, red screens contributed to the growth of the plants, increasing the number of shoots and leaves, and also plant height. The productivity and quality of floral stems was, however, highest in plants grown under blue and black screens. It can be concluded that, under the prevailing experimental conditions, the use of blue screens (35%-40%) and black screens (45%-49%) is suitable for production of the floral stems of ‘Golden Torch’ heliconia.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21877/20665,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Forage intake processes by goats on a massai grass pasture with different sward heights,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the forage-intake process of goats feeding on Massai grass pastures with different heights (40, 50, 60, and 70 cm). The experimental design was completely randomized, with treatments corresponding to four sward heights with two replicates over time and space. Collected data were related to the forage-intake process and the chemical and morphological composition of the pasture. Grazing trials (45 min) were performed with four Anglo-Nubian crossbred goats. Total forage mass intake, bite mass, and intake rate were expressed in relation to animal weight. Pasture density, forage mass, and leaf blade increased as forage height increased. The chemical composition of forage at the evaluated heights was similar, except for reduced crude protein content at 70-cm height. Bite rate, intake rate, and time per bite had a quadratic relationship with increasing sward height. The greatest intake rate was observed at 54.7 cm of height, with 0.136 g DM min-1 kg-1 LW. Bite rate exhibited a linear and positive correlation with increase in intake. At the 50-cm height, goats harvested a mass of 3.65 g DM bite-1 kg-1 LW, when they performed 34.5 bites per minute. Adult goats had a greater forage intake on 50-cm high Massai grass pastures because they could obtain a greater bite mass in a shorter time per bite.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25449/20089,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Thermoregulatory responses of sindhi and guzerat heifers under shade in a tropical environment,"This study characterized the thermal environment and assessed the physiological aspects of acclimatization of Sindhi and Guzerat heifers in a tropical environment (Brazil) under shade. Eight Sindhi and eight Guzerat purebred heifers (Bos indicus) had their physiological traits measured twice a day (9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.). Environmental data during the experimental period were collected at two-hour intervals between 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. The temperature-humidity (THI) and the black globe temperature-humidity (BGHI) indices were calculated, and surface temperature (St), respiratory rate (Rr), and rectal temperature (Rt) were collected, being used to estimate heat loss by cutaneous (Ec) and respiratory (Er) evaporation. In the warmer parts of the day (1:00 and 3:00 p.m.), the THI and BGHI reached values of 80.26 and 81.25, respectively. There was no significant difference in rectal temperatures between the breeds, but higher values were observed in the afternoon. Heat transfer by cutaneous evaporation reached 118.71±12.91 W.m-2 and 103.43±6.82 W.m-2 at 2:00 p.m. for the Sindhi and Guzerat heifers, respectively. Under these conditions (air temperature was between 29 and 30°C), 84% of the total latent heat loss in Sindhi and Guzerat heifers was represented by Ec. It can be concluded that Sindhi and Guzerat heifers can maintain homeothermy with minimal thermoregulatory effort under shade conditions in a tropical environment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25347/20137,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Productive characteristics of meat quails reared in different environments,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ambient temperature and consumption on the performance, carcass yields and cuts, organs, and body temperatures of meat quails. The experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Maranhão, campus of Chapadinha-MA, during September to October 2013. From the 14th day of age, 450 meat quails, not sexed, with an average initial weight of 90.4 ± 12.9 g, were distributed in batteries and accommodated in either acclimatized or non-acclimatized rooms, until 42 days of age. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three treatments, and six replicates of 25 birds each. The treatments were CE (acclimatized environment at 26 °C); NE (natural environment), and CECC (acclimatized environment at 26 °C with controlled feed, to keep the same consumption level as that of the birds in NE). The evaluated variables at 28 and 42 days of age were as follows: (1) the intake of feed, weight gain, feed conversion, body weight, and energy efficiency to weight gain, (2) the carcass weight, carcass yields (%) for breast, thigh, drumstick, and wing, and (3) the relative weights (%) of the digestive tract, heart, liver, gizzard, and intestine. In addition, we evaluated the cloacal and surface temperatures (°C), and subsequently, calculated the average and surface body temperatures. The treatment means were compared using the Student-Newman-Keuls test, with 5% level of significance. Compared with the acclimatized ambient environment, the natural environment more favored the performance of quails up to 28 days, but then affected it negatively from that age onward. Carcass yield, organs, and internal temperature of the quails maintained in the acclimatized and natural environments were not influenced.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25208/20087,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Influence of concentrate levels in diet and body biotypes on productive variables of Guzera beef cattle,"The goal of this study was evaluate diets (50 or 80% of concentrate) and body biotypes (late or early) on performance, behavior, carcass condition, meat quality, and feed cost estimates in feedlot finishing Guzera beef cattle. Use of concentrates in the diet may improve performance and carcass fat scores in ruminant animals, but Guzera beef cattle may be more efficient in forage conversion, which directly influences the economic viability of the production system. We evaluated 32 non-castrated male Guzera beef cattle at 32±2 months of age. The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and six replicates in a 2 × 2 factorial design (2 diets × 2 body biotypes). Initial and final body weights were 459.4±31.2 kg and 566.7±40.8 kg, respectively. There was no change (P > 0.05) in dry matter intake, feed conversion, or daily weight gain when the concentrate in the diet was increased to 80%. Animals fed a diet with 80% of concentrate spent less time (P < 0.05) ruminating (17.8±6.3 vs. 6.3±2.7% of the assessed time). Body biotype did not alter the variables. The rise from 50 to 80% in the proportion of dietary concentrate increased carcass fat, with positive returns in the production process, even given the reduction in rumination, which can lead to poor welfare of animals consuming 80% of dietary concentrate. Body biotype did not affect the variables studied, but it is worth emphasizing that the age at slaughter of these animals probably influenced this result. Thus, selection of the best diet should be based on feeding cost, and in accordance with the cost estimated in this study, the diet with 80% of concentrate is the most suitable for feedlot finished Guzera beef cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25148/20085,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Carcass characteristics and meat quality of Nellore females reared in an intensive system using progesterone ear implant,"This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of a synthetic progesterone ear implant on weight gain and meat quality of Nellore heifers. Twenty-eight Nellore heifers with an average initial weight of 240.9 kg were used in this experiment. All heifers received the same dietary management, in an intensive rearing system, with mineral salt and water ad libitum. Heifers were distributed, in a completely randomized design, into two treatments (with and without progesterone ear implant) with seven replications, in 14 stalls. Analysis of variance was performed, and, for non-parametric variables, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. Parameters referring to the meat quantitative and qualitative characteristics, represented by the weight and yield of the carcass, conformation, marbling, color, meat texture, carcass morphometric measurements, longissimus dorsi muscle area, and fat thickness, were not affected by the progesterone hormone. The use of the progesterone ear implant did not change the carcass physical characteristics or the meat quality characteristics.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25131/20084,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Ingestive behavior of heifers on Brachiaria pasture deferred with different periods of sealing,"This study aimed to evaluate four deferral periods for pastures of Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk, and the implications on the ingestive behavior of crossbred heifers. Animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four periods (63, 84, 105 and 126 days), each with three replications. The time spent daily by animals on grazing, idle, rumination and in the trough was not affected by periods of sealing the pastures, with mean values of 566.6; 422.29; 426.9 and 24.1 minutes, respectively. The number of feeding stations, the time spent in the stations and the number of feeding stations per minute were not different between periods of sealing the pastures, averaging 106.4; 34.6 and 3.0, respectively. The number of bites and the number of bites per minute showed a quadratic effect, with a point of maximum equal to 1,098 bites and 31 bites per minute, observed on days 93 and 88, respectively. Feed efficiency was linearly decreasing influenced by periods of sealing the pastures. Periods of grazing and idle, the number of bites, the number of bites per minute and feed efficiency are influenced by different deferral periods of pastures under the conditions of this study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/25014/20082,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Feeding behavior of dairy cows on pasture fed detoxicated castor meal in the diet,"This study evaluated the feeding behavior of lactating cows on pasture of Brachiaria (Urochloa) decumbens fed with concentrate supplementation containing different levels of castor meal inclusion treated with calcium hydroxide Ca (OH) 2, in the proportions of 0; 3.3; 6.6 to 10% of the total diet. Eight cows (degree of blood ½ to ¾ Holstein x Zebu), with previous average production of 3000-4000 kg adjusted to 300 days of lactation and average body weight of 465.16 kg ± 65.45 kg were distributed in two 4 x 4 Latin squares. The behavior was assessed every five minutes for 24 hours on the 21st day of each period. The results were tested by analysis of variance and regression at p < 0.05 probability. The time spent in grazing, rumination, idle and in the trough; total chewing time, number of cuds per day, chewing per day; chewing per cud; the number of periods of grazing, rumination, idle and in the trough; time spent by period of grazing, rumination, idle and in the trough were not different between treatments. The feed efficiency (g DM h-1; g NDFa h-1 and g TDN h-1) and time spent per cud ruminated TSR sec cud-1) were linearly reduced. It is recommended to include up to 10% castor meal treated with Ca (OH)2 in the total diet.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24594/20080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Growing and finishing crossbred feedlot ewe lambs fed with increasing levels of concentrate in the diet,"To maximize economic gain in sheep production systems it is critical to adjust feedlot diets to maximize performance while minimizing feed, and especially concentrate, waste. Little information is available on ideal diets for crossbred ewe lambs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of feedlot crossbred ewe lambs, and the digestibility of diets, with increasing levels of concentrate during the growing and finishing phases. Twenty-four crossbred Texel × Pantaneira Texel ewe lambs were confined and fed Tifton hay with increasing levels of concentrate in the diet (20, 40, 60 and 80%) for individual evaluation of dry matter intake (DMI), digestibility of diets, average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FE). Animals were slaughtered at 47 kg. In the growing phase, the inclusion of concentrate in the diets (1176 g.kg-1) did not change DMI (p > 0.05). Concentrate levels had a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) on the dry matter digestibility coefficient (DMDC) and on total digestible nutrients (TDN) during the growing phase. In the finishing phase, there was a negative linear effect of concentrate levels on DMI (p < 0.05), but TDN intake was similar among the experimental diets (p > 0.05). DMDC and TDN values displayed a quadratic behavior (p < 0.05), plateauing at 60% concentrate. ADG and FE increased as concentrate was added to the diet in the growing phase (p < 0.05). During the finishing phase, lamb performance was similar (p > 0.05) for different diets. Thus, the use of 60% concentrate in the confined crossbred ewe lamb diet during growing and 20% concentrate during finishing is recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24586/20095,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of technical indexes on cost-effectiveness in dairy farms participating in the “Balde Cheio” program at different stages of production,"This study assesses the effects of technical and managerial indexes on the cost-effectiveness of 20 demonstration units (DUs) that participated in the “Full Bucket” (“Balde Cheio”) program, at different stages of production, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, from January to December 2011. Here, cost-effectiveness was assessed by considering gross margin, net margin, result (financial profit or loss), cost-effectiveness, and profitability as indicators of financial efficiency. Data were analyzed using PASW 18.0. A multiple linear regression model was used with the stepwise method to identify the managerial, technical, and other indexes that most affected profitability and cost-effectiveness. The production systems were categorized into three production levels: small (nine DUs), medium (nine DUs), or large (two DUs). The managerial and technical indexes differed according to the stages of production under study. The daily milk production for the three categories were below 151 kg, 151 to 400 kg, and above 400 kg, respectively. The best profitability and cost-effectiveness at the large production level resulted from selling livestock. This level showed greater animal/day productivity (kg of milk), the best cows/farm manpower ratio, and the best number of herd animals/farm manpower ratio, whereas the medium level showed a lower fixed cost/total cost relation. The small production level showed the best percentages of lactating cows, cows in the herd, and lactating cows in the herd, as well as the best productivity/ha/year and lactating cows/ha. However, the latter results were not sufficient to generate a profit, owing to the small scale of production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24515/20077,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Carcass characteristics of purebred and crossbred Nellore females fed solely pasture,"This research aimed to compare carcasses of purebred and crossbred Nellore females reared uniquely on pasture (Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu). Breeds assessed consisted of purebred Nellore (16) and Nellore x Santa Gertrudis crossbred (16), being 32 ± 1.5 months old. All animals were slaughtered as they reached 450 kg. Crossbred females showed higher slaughter, hot and cold carcass weights and longer lengths (P < 0.05). Conversely, purebred animals attained greater carcass yields (P < 0.05). Nonetheless, crossbred females had higher primal cut weights and plate/ flank percentage (P < 0.05). Also, non-carcass components as kidneys, liver, kidney-pelvic-heart fat showed higher weights for crossbred females (P < 0.05). Thus, regarding beef cattle reared and finished exclusively on grazing areas, crossbred females (Nellore x Santa Gertrudis) may be the most profitable ones for cattle raisers, since they produce heavier slaughtering carcasses. Notwithstanding, they might be interesting for meat industry, for yielding more in prime cuts than purebreds, even if raised at the same conditions and slaughtered at same age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23772/20075,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Assessment of the healing of standardized wounds in rabbits treated serially with autologous platelet-rich plasma gel,"Recent studies have been carried out to evaluate the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the cicatrization of wounds; however, the protocols for treatment have been based on a single application of PRP.To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma in gel form on the cicatrization of cutaneous wounds in vivo experimental model, wounds were induced in the dorsal areas of six New Zealand white rabbits with the aid of an 8-mm punch. The right side was used as a control (A) and treated with 0.9% NaCl, whereas the left side (B) was treated serially with the autologous platelet-rich plasma gel. Lesions were assessed over a 17-day period. At days 0, 10 and 17, the animals were evaluated and morphological and morphometric analyses of the wounds were performed. At day 17, a biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation. Macroscopically, wounds treated with PRP showed better cicatrization and higher contraction percentages than the control wounds. Regarding the percentage of wound contraction, it was found that the average treated wound with autologous platelet-rich plasma gelwas 95% while withthecontrolwas88%. We concluded that autologous platelet-rich plasma gel is effective and accelerates cicatrization when used serially in short intervals, thus confirming its therapeutic potential in cutaneous lesions and potential as an alternative wound treatment option.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23823/20065,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Prevention and control of bovine cysticercosis: a Delphi study,"Bovine cysticercosis is a zoonotic parasitic infection caused by the larval stage (Cysticercus bovis) of Taenia saginata. This study aimed to identify prevention and control measures for bovine cysticercosis indicated by experts in the fields of public and animal health. The study was conducted through three rounds of the Delphi method and had the participation of 44 experts from 13 Brazilian states in 30 educational institutions, research institutions, and sanitary inspection services. The first round comprised an open question, the answers to which formed the basis for structuring the second and third questionnaire. To reach a consensus in the second and third rounds, experts were asked to express their agreement or disagreement of each proposition on the questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed at the end of each round. Twenty-three specialists (52.27%) participated in all three rounds. The first round resulted in 28 proposals categorized into six areas: health education, methods of diagnosis and treatment, sanitation measures, epidemiological studies, legislation and sanitary supervision, and intersectorality. In the second round, the experts reached a consensus on 16 propositions (57.14%). This percentage increased by 3.54% during the third round. At the end of the third round, the experts had reached a consensus on 17 of the 28 initial propositions (60.71%). The highest percentage of agreement (29.4%) was observed in the category of health education. This study allowed us to identify 17 recommendations pertaining to the prevention and control of bovine cysticercosis. These measures are not mutually exclusive, and require an integrated approach to the establishment of intervention actions at various points in the life cycle of the parasite.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23839/20066,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Epidemiological analysis of infection by the bovine viral diarrhea virus on family farms in Brazil,"The aim of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of infection by the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) on family farms, as well as to study the risk factors associated with the infection. In total, 319 blood serum samples were collected from cattle, of reproductive age (>24 months) in 24 herds from 11 cities of the brejo microregion in Pernambuco. The samples were subjected to the seroneutralization test to detect anti-BVDV antibodies. In order to identify the risk factors associated with the BVDV, a questionnaire epidemiologic was applied and followed by statistical analysis of logistic regression, with the serological test considered as the dependent variable (reagent or non-reagent). A prevalence of 51.1% (163/319; C.I. 45.5% - 56.7%) was found in the present study. Of the 24 herds sampled, 100.0% contained at least one reagent animal. The prevalence in the counties ranged from 23.1% to 70.0%. The following risk factors were identified in the present study: not providing colostrum (OR 3.85; p=0.018); disease unknown (OR 2.54; p=0.001) and consortium breeding (OR 1.76; p=0.013). Based on these results, it was clear that BVDV infection is widespread in herds on family farms in the microregion studied herein. Health education policies must be implemented for producers and professionals who provide technical assistance. In addition, based on the risk factors identified in the present study, hygiene-sanitary measures should be implemented in order to reduce the prevalence of the BVDV.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23792/20064,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Evaluation of pregnancy rates of Bos indicus cows subjected to different synchronization ovulation protocols using injectable progesterone or an intravaginal device,"This study evaluated the pregnancy rate in Nelore cows (Bos indicus) that were subjected to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) using different protocols consisting of injectable progesterone (P4) or an intravaginal device (impregnated with P4). Multiparous cows 72-84 months in age, 30-45 days postpartum, were selected on the basis of the absence of a corpus luteum (CL) and follicles < 8 mm after transrectal palpation and ultrasound examinations. On a random day of the estrus cycle (D0), the selected animals (n = 135) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (n = 45 each). Group I (injectable P4/FTAI 36 hours) received 250 mg of injectable P4 and 2 mg EB on D0; on D7, they received 500 µg of cloprostenol; on D8, 300 IU of eCG and 1 mg of EB were administered; and finally, FTAI was performed 36 hours after the application of EB. Group II (injectable P4/FTAI 48 hours) received the same protocol as Group I, except that the FTAI was performed 48 hours after ovulation induction. The animals of Group III (Control/CIDR) received a conventional protocol for FTAI using an intravaginal device (D0: P4 and 2 mg EB; D8: device removal, 500 µg cloprostenol, 300 IU eCG, 1 mg EB; and FTAI performed 48 hours after removal of the device). The results showed that cows synchronized with the conventional protocol for FTAI (Control/CIDR) had a higher pregnancy rate (60 %, 27/45) than those synchronized with an injectable P4/FTAI 36 hours (33.33 %; 15/45, P = 0.010). However, the group receiving injectable P4 group/FTAI 48 hours had a similar pregnancy rate (48.9 %; 22/45; P = 0.290) when compared to both the group receiving the conventional protocol and that receiving injectable P4/FTAI 36 hours (P = 0.134). Although the injectable P4 may affect pregnancy rate with the FTAI performed in 36 hours, we found similar pregnancy rates from cows inseminated 48 hours after induction ovulation, considering injectable or intravaginal P4. Therefore, we suggest that injectable P4 represents an alternative source of progesterone for synchronization of cattle for FTAI.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23973/20067,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Ensiling of elephant grass with soybean hulls or rice bran,"The goal was to evaluate the chemical composition and fermentation pattern of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Roxo) silage with different levels of soybean hulls or rice bran. Two trials were conducted, comprising of a completely randomized design, with four replicates each. Treatments consisted on the addition of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of soybean hulls or rice bran to unwilted green elephant grass forage. Large PVC silos were used adopting a density of 600 kg of green mass m-3. The silos were opened 40 days after ensiling. The results revealed that the inclusion of 10% soybean hulls increased elephant grass forage dry matter (DM) content to 31%, but did not alter the water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content or buffering capacity. The resultant silages exhibited good fermentation patterns in terms of pH (less than 3.97) and NH3-N (4.07% total N) levels. The inclusion of rice bran increased both DM and WSC content in the forage, improving the fermentation pattern of silages (P < 0.05). This too was verified by a pH lower than 3.92 and a maximum NH3-N of 4.23% of the total N. The inclusion of 10% rice bran to the elephant grass improved the nutritional value of the forage to be ensiled and, hence, of the produced silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20464/20074,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Ultrasonographic findings of the mammary gland, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys in transgenic goats for hG-CSF during induced lactation","In transgenic murine models, the study of certain organs or tissues can be performed after euthanasia of some specimens. However, this practice may not be economically feasible when applied to livestock such as transgenic goats. It is necessary to use minimally invasive methods to perform in vivo studies of organs that may be affected by disorders related to the activity of the transgene, particularly during milk production, when the recombinant protein is secreted. The aim of this study was to describe ultrasonographic findings of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and mammary glands in transgenic goats for evaluating the effect of human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (hG-CSF) expression in milk during induced lactation. Six female Canindé goats-three transgenic (T) and three non-transgenic (NT)-were subjected to hormone therapy to induce lactation; ultrasonographic examinations of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and mammary gland were performed during both the hormonal therapy and the lactation period at different intervals depending on the organ being examined. On Day 16 (Day 1 = hormonal therapy initiation), all goats were lactating and presented healthy mammary glands, characterized by echogenic parenchyma showing a granular echotexture. Transgenic and non-transgenic goats were compared on the basis of measurements and ultrasound images obtained from each organ. No differences between T and NT animals were observed in the examined area for the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys. Liver and renal echogenicity and appearance of gallbladder and portal and hepatic veins were similar in all females. Ultrasonographic findings of the mammary gland, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys in transgenic goats did not show any difference from those in non-transgenic goats.Thus, these results suggest that the presence and expression of the transgene had no effect on the ultrasonographic findings of mammary gland and abdominal organs in the transgenic goats. Moreover, the findings shows that ultrasonography is a useful screening tool for clinical examination of transgenic goats; this allows the investigation of possible disorders and avoids the unnecessary use of invasive techniques.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23744/20063,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,"Epidemiological and microbiological aspects of residential outbreaks of foodborne illness in the Parana State, Brazil","Foodborne illness results in high costs to public health and the food chain production worldwide. The majority of the population is unaware of food safety requirements and consequently, domestic kitchens are sources of contamination and spread of disease. Eating habits and the profile of food handlers in these sites guide the planning of surveillance and public education. This study describes the epidemiological and microbiological aspects of household outbreaks of foodborne illness in the State of Parana, using the Notifiable Diseases Information System database. There were 357 outbreaks between 2008 and 2012 in the State of Parana, and households were the main place of occurrence (43.70%), followed by restaurants and bakeries (21.00%), and kindergartens and schools (11.20 %). Household outbreak records derived from the municipalities for regional health coverage, based in Curitiba, Cascavel, Pato Branco, Foz do Iguaçu and Londrina. These indicated an increased number of reported cases between 2011 and 2012. The increase in reporting reflects a greater awareness among professionals because of training. The results highlight the consumption of contaminated food (36.15%), by strains of coagulase positive Staphylococcus (36.23%).

The combination of opioids and local anesthetics increased the intensity and duration of analgesia by causing immediate motor and sensory nerve blockade, and improved recovery after surgery. The objective was to comparatively evaluate the trans- and postoperative cardiorespiratory and analgesic effects of epidurally administered tramadol, ropivacaine and tramadol-ropivacaine combination in dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy. The effect of isoflurane concentration was also evaluated. This study was performed on 24 female mongrel dogs, pre-medicated with chlorpromazine (0.5 mg kg-1, IV) and, anesthetized with propofol and isoflurane. The dogs were randomly divided into three groups. The first group receveid epidural tramadol (2 mg kg-1, GT group), the second group received ropivacaine (1.5 mg kg-1, GR group), and the third group received a tramadol-ropivacaine combination at the above-mentioned doses (GTR group). At pre-defined time points, classified into pre-, trans-, and postoperative periods, cardiorespiratory variables and analgesia were analyzed for a period of up to 420 min following epidural anesthesia. The check analgesia was check of approximately 105, 217 and 382 minutes, in GR, in GT and GTR respectively, and no cardiovascular and respiratory depression. The drugs used in this study are considered safe and effective for ovariohysterectomy due to the cardiorespiratory stability and trans-operative analgesia provided by them. However, the combination of ropivacaine and tramadol ensured a greater reduction in the inhaled anesthetic dose and better analgesia during in the postoperative period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20911/20059,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Factors affecting clay dispersion in oxisols treated with vinasse,"Vinasse is a potassium-rich waste generated in large amounts by the ethanol production that, applied in the soil, can promote changes in water dispersible clay and in its physical quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clay dispersion of Oxisols after vinasse application and correlate it with some chemical attributes. Samples were collected in two Oxisols (155 and 471 g of clay kg-1), put in pots, received dosages of vinasse (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 m3 ha-1) and remained incubated during 120 days. Phosphorous, organic carbon, pH H2O, pH KCl, pH CaCl2, Al3+, H+Al3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Delta pH and the proportion between monovalent and bivalent cations have been evaluated and correlated with the clay flocculation degree. Vinasse changed almost all chemical variables in both soils and increased the flocculation in the sandy soil, but did not change the clayey one. Delta pH, Mg2+ and K+ significantly correlated with the flocculation degree in the sandy soil. It is possible to conclude that the dispersive effect of K+ added by vinasse are irrelevant, considering the flocculant effect caused by the increment in Mg2+ and Delta pH after vinasse application.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/26487/20049,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Characterization and sensory preference of fermented dairy beverages prepared with different concentrations of whey and araticum pulp,"The objective of this study was to develop a fermented dairy beverage flavored with araticum pulp, assess its physicochemical characteristics, microbiological quality, and sensory preference by the consumer. Araticum pulp was prepared using two different methods: with or without bleaching (50 ºC/5 minutes). Formulations of fermented dairy beverages consisting of whey (50%), standardized pasteurized milk (50%), and seven different concentrations of bleached araticum pulp (5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, and 20.0% w/v) were prepared. In addition, seven formulations of fermented dairy beverage, without adding araticum pulp, and consisting of varying proportions of whey (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100%) were developed. In all formulations, thickeners/stabilizers were added. All araticum pulp samples (with and without bleach) and fermented dairy beverages (with and without araticum pulp) were analyzed for the relevant physicochemical properties: pH, titratable acidity, acidity of pulp, acidity of fermented beverage, moisture, ash, fat, protein, crude fiber, ascorbic acid, carbohydrates, total solids, and caloric values. Microbiological counts of coliforms at 35 °C and 45 °C in the pulp and beverage, and molds and yeasts and Salmonella sp. in the pulp were obtained. Additionally, sensory analysis regarding preferences of the different fermented dairy beverage formulations was also performed. The araticum pulp samples without bleach, showed higher values of pH, moisture, protein, total fiber, and ascorbic acid, as compared to bleached pulp samples, while bleached araticum pulp showed higher values for other physicochemical parameters. Microbiological results showed that all pulps and fruit-dairy beverages were suitable for consumption. It was found that there was no significant consumer preference between different fermented beverage formulations, according to the different percentages of pulp. However, the formulations consisting of 40, 50, 60, and 70% whey were preferred over the one consisting of 100% whey.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21442/20051,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Influence of maturity stage on fruit longevity of cherry tomatoes stored at ambient and controlled temperature,"Fruit maturity stage has direct influence on the post-harvest life and consumer quality. Therefore, the understanding of the maturation process and its quality characteristics for storage are key factors for commercialization. In face of the foregoing, this study aimed to determine shelf life and changes in physical and chemical indexes of cherry tomatoes (Perinha Água Branca (PAB) and Mascot), assessing fruit harvested at four maturity stages and stored at ambient and controlled temperatures. For this, it was used fruit at turning, pink, red and ripe maturity stages, submitted to ambient (25 ± 2 °C) and controlled (12 °C and 90% RH) temperature, and assessed over time the indexes of fresh mass loss, titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids and ascorbic acid. The experimental design was completely randomized design in a factorial scheme of 2×4×7 for ambient temperature and 2×4×8 for controlled temperature. At ambient temperature, a longevity of up to 20 days was observed for PAB and Mascot fruit harvested at turning and pink maturity stages. When harvested at red and ripe stages, the longevity was of 15 days for PAB fruit and of 15 and 11 days, respectively, for Mascot fruit. At controlled temperature, PAB fruit showed longevity of 24 days when harvested at turning and pink stages and of 20 and 7 days, respectively, when harvested at red and ripe stages. A longevity of up to 27 days was observed for Mascot fruit harvested at turning stage and of 24 days for the other stages.

37,2016,Determination of the adaptability and stability of soybean cultivars in different locations and at different sowing times in Paraná state using the AMMI and Eberhart and Russel methods,"This study aimed to evaluate the adaptability and phenotypic stability of 10 soybean genotypes in 12 environments in Paraná state by using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis (AMMI) and Eberhart and Russell models. The assays were conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates, in the 2010/2011 season in four locations in Paraná state (Assaí, São Pedro do Ivaí, Cornélio Procópio, and Marilândia do Sul), and with three sowing dates (15/-20/10/10; 29/10-03/11/10; 15/-20/11/10). The cultivars tested with Roundup Ready® technology included SYN 1049, SYN 1152, SYN 1059, SYN 3358, SYN 1163, SYN 1157, V-MAX, FT Campo Mourão, BMX Potência, and SYN 9070. The yield character was analyzed. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and the adaptability and stability were then analyzed. The results of the AMMI and Eberhart and Russell models were somewhat consistent for the stability parameter only. The AMMI analysis was able to capture 66% of the variance associated with residue no additives, of which 43.18% was retained in the first principal component of interaction and 23.58%, in the second component. This is sufficient to explain the genotype × environment interaction. The SYN 1059, SYN 1163, and VMAX genotypes are distinguished by their considerably higher yield and productive adaptation. In the AMMI analysis, the cultivar SYN 1163 showed commercial promise among the other cultivars for high grain yield performance, adaptation, and response predictability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24479/20047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,The use of various strains of Rhizobium tropici for inoculation of snap bean cultivars with a determinate growth pattern,"The snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an economically important vegetable in Brazil. Bean plants can establish symbiotic associations with bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen. These associations show specificity of host plants to certain bacteria. Nitrogen fertilization constitutes a crop production cost, and the use of Rhizobium inoculation to supply nitrogen to crops may decrease the production costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of inoculation of three different snap bean cultivars with three Rhizobium tropici strains on agronomical performance of the plant. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with a 3 ? 5 factorial scheme and four replicates per treatment. The factors tested were three snap bean cultivars (UEL 1, Alessa, and UEL 2), and five types of inoculation (uninoculated control, inoculation with SEMIA 4077, SEMIA 4080, SEMIA 4088, or with a mix of the three strains). The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. Plant height, stem diameter, pod length, the number of pods per plant, and average weight and yield of commercial-grade pods, were determined. An analysis of variance was conducted using the F test, followed by Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Inoculation had a positive effect on all the parameters quantified. The beneficial effect was more pronounced in plants inoculated with the mix of Rhizobium strains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23781/20102,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Seroepidemiology of Leishmania infantum in dogs in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Leishmaniosis are zoonoses that present several clinical manifestations in humans and have dogs as their main reservoir in the urban environment. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the parasitosis and has been increasing in Brazil, despite the actions of public health agencies. Until 2002, the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) was considered free of human and canine leishmaniasis. The first human case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in RS was recorded in 2003. In 2009, the first autochthonous cases of human VL and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were confirmed in São Borja, RS, and the occurrence of the insect vector was recorded for the first time in the state. In 2010, the first confirmed case of CVL was reported and seropositive dogs were identified in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. Given the importance of this zoonosis and the difficulties of a reliable diagnosis in dogs, this study aimed to identify epidemiological aspects of CVL in dogs in an area of Porto Alegre where cases of the disease have been reported. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from dogs in this area, which were then tested by the methods of RT-DPP® and ELISA for diagnosis of Leishmania infantum. An epidemiological questionnaire was completed by dog owners, containing aspects related to care of the animals, characteristics of their environment, and their living conditions. We observed that 83% (250/300) of the studied dogs were of mixed breed, 58% (175/300) were female, 78% (238/300) slept outdoors, and 61% (183/300) shared their living quarters with other species. Clinically, we observed that 90% (270/300) of the animals were infested by ectoparasites, 70% (210/300) had dermatopathies, 24% (72/300) presented weight loss and anorexia, and 22% (65/300) had ocular disorders. The results of the two serological tests were 100% concordant for the three seropositive samples (1%), and the remaining 297 (99%) were negative for both tests. We conclude that despite the low prevalence of L. infantum seropositive dogs, conditions in the region are favorable for CVL transmission, creating a risk of VL for the human population in the city of Porto Alegre.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21808/20098,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Silicon does not alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress in soybean plants,"Beneficial effects of silicon (Si) in the plants growth under conditions of drought stress have been associated with to uptake and accumulation ability of element by different species. However, the effects of Si on soybean under water stress are still incipient and inconclusive. This study investigated the effect of Si application as a way to confer greater soybean tolerance to drought stress. The experiment was carried out in 20-L pots under greenhouse conditions. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in a 2 × 4 factorial: two water regimes (no stress or water stress) and four Si rates (0, 50, 100 and 200 mg kg–1). Soybean plants were grown until beginning flowering (R1) growth stage with soil moisture content near at the field capacity, and then it started the differentiation of treatments under drought by the suspension of water supply. Changes in relative water content (RWC) in leaf, electrolyte leakage from cells, peroxidase activity, plant nutrition and growth were measured after 7 days of drought stress and 3 days recovery. The RWC in soybean leaves decreased with Si rates in the soil. Silicon supply in soil with average content of this element, reduced dry matter production of soybean under well-irrigated conditions and caused no effect on dry matter under drought stress. The nitrogen uptake by soybean plants is reduced with the Si application under drought stress. The results indicated that the Si application stimulated the defense mechanisms of soybean plants, but was not sufficient to mitigate the negative effects of drought stress on the RWC and dry matter production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23530/20044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,The plant stimulant humic acid extracted from organic waste recycled by composting combined with liming and fertilization,"The disposal of organic waste can be an environmental problem; on the other hand, this waste can be the raw material for the production of biostimulants, among other recycling processes. The objective of this study was to recycle waste bovine manure and poultry litter through composting and isolate its humic acids in order to test their use, in the presence and absence of liming and fertilization, on corn plants as indicators. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. The experimental unit was a vase of 1 dm3 filled with soil that received treatments generated by the combination of the factors under study: humic acids via seed, liming, and fertilization. After thirty days of the experiment, growth characteristics were measured to estimate the initial performance of the indicator corn plants in response to the treatments. The results showed that the combination of chemical fertilization with humic acids extracted from organic compounds increased the plants development. In conclusion, the use of biostimulants based on humic substances is positive and complementary to fertilizers used in agriculture, forming a superior combination. Such use is also recommended because it allows for the recycling of organic waste via composting, as well as the preparation of biostimulants for added technical, and potentially economic, value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23602/20045,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Effect of the interaction between fungicide application time and rainfall simulation interval on Asian Soybean Rust control effectiveness,"Environmental factors affect the performance of fungicides in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). They also influence the residual activity of the products applied to the leaves. The objective of this study was to assess the control effectiveness of the interaction between fungicide application and rainfall simulation on Asian Soybean Rust (ASR). Two experiments were conducted, one in the greenhouse, in a completely randomized design, and the other in the field, in a randomized block design. Both the experiments had the same factorial arrangement of 6x5, with four replications. Factor A: Five fungicide applications time at 0400 h, 0900 h, 1400 h, 1800 h, 2300 h and, a control with no application; Factor B: four intervals of time between the application of fungicide and rainfall simulation at 0, 30, 60 and 120 min for the experiment in the greenhouse and at 2, 30, 60, 120 min for the experiment in the field. A control was included for both the experiments with no rainfall. The number of days to the appearance of the first pustules was determined, along with severity of ASR, relative chlorophyll index and productivity. It was found that the ASR control effectiveness of fungicide applications in soybean plants in sunlight was less efficient with rainfall simulation. The rainfall simulation had greater negative effect on disease control effectiveness in applications conducted at night under dew conditions. The application conducted at 0900 h showed the greatest disease control effectiveness in both greenhouse and in the field conditions. The 1400 h application showed decreased fungicide control residual and ASR control effectiveness, possibly due to a combination of the low relative humidity and high temperature. Rainfall simulation carried out at 120 min after application still had the ability to affect the ASR control effectiveness.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23315/20042,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of drying on the physical properties of adzuki bean,"The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of drying on the physical properties of adzuki bean (Vigna angularis Willd.). Adzuki beans with moisture content of 47.9% were dried in a oven with forced air ventilation at temperatures of 40, 60 and 80 °C and relative humidity of 18.5, 8.6, and 3.8%, respectively, until the moisture content reached 12.9%. We used 15 adzuki beans individualised in aluminium capsules. The orthogonal axes of the beans (length, width, and thickness) were measured at intervals of five percentage points during the reduction of moisture content. The parameters determined were: sphericity; circularity; volume of beans; volumetric contraction index; volume contraction percentage; surface area; projected area; and surface-volume ratio. The drying conditions altered the physical properties of adzuki bean. As a result of moisture content reduction, there was increased sphericity and surface-volume ratio, and decreased volume, unitary volumetric contraction, surface area, and projected area. Circularity was not influenced by the drying temperatures within the range of moisture content analysed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23277/20490,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Physiological quality of the seeds of common bean cultivars grown in different phosphorus levels and growing seasons,"The use of appropriate management practices, such as sowing and fertilizing, associated with the use of promising genotypes are strategies for obtaining bean seeds of high quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological quality of cultivars of common bean seeds produced in two growing seasons under different phosphorus levels. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial design of 2 × 2 × 6, with four replications. We evaluated two common bean cultivars (‘IAC Carioca Precoce’ and ‘IAC Carioca Tybatã’), two planting seasons of common beans (rainy season and dry season), and six rates of phosphorus fertilization (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 kg ha-1 of P2O5) applied to the planting rows, using triple super phosphate as the source of P. Seed quality was evaluated by testing the water content, germination, first account of the germination test, accelerated aging test and the water content after the test, electrical conductivity, and seedling emergence in the field. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means of cultivars and growing seasons were compared using Tukey’s test at 5% probability. Regression analysis was performed for phosphorus levels. Seeds of ‘IAC Carioca Precoce’ produced during the rainy season showed higher germination. In the dry season, the highest seedling emergence in the field was recorded for ‘IAC Carioca Tybatã’. Common bean cultivation provided seeds with higher germination and vigor in the dry season than in the rainy season. The accelerated aging test showed that when phosphorus was applied in the planting rows, the vigor of common bean seed was enhanced, with a better response to higher doses when cultivated in the dry season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23001/20039,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Phosphorus fractions and correlation with soil attributes in a chronosequence of agricultural under no-tillage,"In no-tillage (NT) soils, changes in the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) have been observed over time. These changes can interfere with the dynamics of P in surface soil layers. Thus, the objectives of this study were: to evaluate the organic and inorganic fractions of P and their degree of lability (labile, moderately labile, and moderately recalcitrant) in an Oxisol under NT for 6 years (NT6), 14 years (NT14), and 22 years (NT22) and cultivated with a succession of soybean and corn/wheat. The fractions were evaluated for 16 years of NT, with the last four years under integrated corn second crop and Brachiaria (NT16+B). We also analyzed an area of native forest, as well as analyzing the correlations between the results of the P fractions of these areas with other attributes such as total carbon content, vegetable waste deposited on the ground, phosphorus and humic fractions remaining in SOM. From each of the areas, samples were collected at 0.00-0.05 m and 0.05-0.10 m. A completely randomized design with 5 replicates was used. Management of phosphorus fertilization and SOM following adoption of the SPD of time (6 to 22 years) increased the levels of all fractions of inorganic P (0.0 to 0.10 m), as well as the fractions of labile (0.05-0.10 m), moderately labile (0.0-0.10 m), and moderately recalcitrant (0.05-0.10 m) organic phosphorus. The correlation matrix shows interactions between the evaluated soil attributes, especially between inorganic phosphorus fractions and fulvic and humic acids and between the moderately recalcitrant organic phosphorus and humin fraction.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23395/20054,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The treatments consisted of four fertilizer concentrations applied at four phenological stages: M1 (10, 15, 25, and 35 g L-1), M2 (15, 20, 30, and 40 g L-1), M3 (20, 25, 35, and 45 g L-1), and M4 (control plants, water spraying only). For Postharvest experiments were conducted in a 4 x 5 factorial design corresponding to the four treatments in the field experiment and five storage times. Spirufert® applied at lower concentrations (M1) resulted in greater fruit yield without affecting the foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na. Higher fertilizer concentrations (M3) increased vegetative growth but reduced eggplant yield.

37,2016,Producing randomness between plots in pepper and snap bean experiments,"It is important to know the production variability among experimental plots in a protected environment because this information reduces error and increases the reliability of the results. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the spatial independence of fruit yield between plots of peppers and snap beans. Data on production uniformity were gathered from trials performed at the Department of Plant Science, Federal University of Santa Maria. Different plots sizes were created according to the number of plants in the crop row. To verify the randomness of the data distribution, we applied a sequence test between the plots within one line for individual and combined harvests. The use of ten plants per plot in experiments with peppers led to no randomness within the lines during the production of fruit fresh biomass. In experiments with snap beans conducted in a greenhouse, a plastic tunnel and by unprotected cultivation using plots with six or more basic units, 12 or more plants per plot produced random fresh biomass data for fruits within the crop row.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23157/20037,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Morphophysiological plasticity of plagiotropic branches in response to change in the coffee plant spacing within rows,"Changes in spacing within rows may alter the morphology of the coffee plant by affecting the physiological constituents of its productivity. Even though some common plant responses to crop spacing variation are known, there is yet no scientific evidence that elucidates the effects of decreased spacing on the sourcesink relation in plagiotropic branches and, its association with both productivity and eco-physiological aspects of coffee leaves, mainly for new coffee cultivars in the Brazilian savannah. The aim of this work was to characterize the morphophysiological responses of Coffea arabica L. cultivars subjected to different spacing between plants within rows. Four Arabica coffee cultivars (Catuaí Vermelho IAC 144, Catuaí Amarelo IAC 62, Catuaí Amarelo IAC 32, and Tupi RN IAC 1669-13) were transplanted in January 2010. A row spacing of 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, and 0.80 m was adopted between plants, maintaining a 3.80-m constant between rows. A randomized block design with four replicates was applied. During the experimental period, several morphophysiological characteristics of plagiotropic fruiting branches were evaluated in the months of April and December in 2013 and, in April 2014. The evaluation was conducted based on two canopy positions; canopy toward the rows, representing low exposure to light or toward the inter-row spacing, representing high light exposure. Leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigments levels were minimally or not at all affected by changing either the coffee cultivars or plant spacing. During the first evaluation, the leaf-to-fruitratio linearly increased, regardless of the cultivar. Light-exposed branches showed higher content of carotenoids and chlorophyll a in leaves and lower leaf-to-fruit-ratio as compared to those within the plant canopy. A major reduction in the number of fruits per branch was observed which was closely related to a parallel decrease in the number of fruits per node but not in the number of fruiting nodes per branch. Although this response was largely cultivar-dependent, it also changed according to the branch position in the hedgerow. Our results suggest that all tested cultivars exhibit high morphophysiological plasticity and have the potential to grow under different plant spacing within rows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22230/20036,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Use of a locking plate “notched head T-plate®” for the fixation of an ilial body fracture in a dog,"Several types of implants may be used to treat iliac fractures in dogs, of which osteosynthesis with plate is the most described and recommended in the literature. The type of plate and screw are major factors in osteosynthesis success. The use of locking plates has been advocated for this purpose, as they do not allow the plate-bone-screw unit to shift, providing angular stability and rigidity to the system. The present study aimed to describe the unprecedented use of a locking notched head T-plate in the treatment of a caudal body of ilium fracture. A two year old male mongrel dog was attended after falling from a third floor height, with two days of evolution. The animal was in standing position, and during orthopedic examination non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb, instability, and crepitus in the right body of ilium, with considerable swelling and pain. The radiographic examination allowed diagnosing a complete fracture of the caudal body of ilium with decrease of the pelvic canal diameter. The patient underwent surgery, and the fracture was stabilized with an LCP notched head T-plate. The patient evolved satisfactorily, with good weight-bearing of the affected limb within 24 hours of surgery, and complete recovery with medical discharge after 60 days of postoperative period, with consolidation of the fracture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22469/19775,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Action of exogenous oxytocin on stress modulation in crossbred Red Angus cows,"Cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) are organised on the basis of leadership and dominance in such a manner that a disturbance by an external stressor causes negative effects on their health, productivity, well-being, and behaviour. One of these effects is the excessive release of glucocorticoids, which results in increased alertness. We evaluated the action of exogenous oxytocin (OT) on serum cortisol levels in crossbred Red Angus heifers. Twelve Red Angus crossbred heifers were moved daily from the pasture to the corral in weeks 1 and 2 for adaptation to human contact and handling in the cattle crush. In weeks 3 and 4, they were divided into two groups of six (T1 and T2). The T1 group was administered 20 IU (2 mL) of OT via intramuscular injection and the T2 group was administered 2 mL of saline solution 0.85% (SS). In weeks 5 and 6, they were only contained in the cattle crush for evaluation. On days 01, 07, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42, blood samples were collected by jugular venepuncture in vacuum tubes without anticoagulants. Then, serum cortisol levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. In the period of adaptation, during weeks 1 and 2, serum cortisol levels decreased in both the groups, with higher levels in the SS group; the same result was obtained in weeks 5 and 6. During treatment, however, there was a significant difference between the two groups in week 4, with a reduction in cortisol levels in the OT group. This result suggests a modulator effect of OT on neuroendocrine response to stress.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23290/19774,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Spatial distribution of cases of fatal yellowing on organic oil palm plantation,"This work studied the spatial dispersion of cases of fatal yellowing (FY) in an oil palm plantation in Acará, Pará State, Brazil. Data were collected monthly from two areas, divided in 16 quadrants each, for a 24 month period (2012-2013). In each quadrant, 138 plants were evaluated. The number of diseased plants was counted in twenty planting lines, and the spatial pattern of the disease was analyzed. The following spatial analysis techniques were used: common sequences of “runs”, “doublets” and quadrants. We also determined the levels of disease aggregation in the sectors. Plants with FY had a spatial distribution aggregated in a lower line number when using the “run” analysis than when using the “doublets” method. Aggregation of FY cases was observed in 30% of the evaluated lines. The quadrant analysis confirmed the existence of case aggregation, with vertical and horizontal distribution. The existence of disease forming foci suggests that FY probably has biotic origin. Additional studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21621/19813,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,"Physical composition of carcass, commercial cuts and meat characteristics of crossbred Holstein-Zebu young bulls fed crude glycerin levels in the diets","Assessment of carcass and meat characteristics of Holstein-Zebu crossbred young bulls finished in feedlot with crude glycerin levels (0, 60, 120, and 240 g kg-1 dry matter) in replace of ground pearl millet grain and babassu mesocarp bran mixture-based diets. Twenty four bulls 30-month-old and initial average body weight of 390 ± 31.5 kg were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments and six replicates. The absolute weight (kg) of commercial cuts did not fit any of the tested regression models. However, the weight of the short ribs and the pistol cut were higher for animals fed with crude glycerin in relation to those fed without inclusion of this food in the diet. The proportion of the commercial cuts, however, was not changed. The increase of the crude glycerin levels linearly increased the proportion of carcass fat and reduced the muscle proportion, without changing the proportion of bone and the edible portion of the carcasses. The ratio muscle/fat reduced linearly with the advance of crude glycerin level of diets. The color of the meat, evaluated subjectively, increased linearly with the advance of crude glycerin levels of the diets, from dark red to slightly dark red. The texture, marbling, shear force, thawing loss and cooking loss were not changed by dietary levels of crude glycerin. The inclusion of up to 240 g kg-1 of crude glycerin in the diets increases the proportion of fat without changing the marketable portion of carcasses. The benefits to the meat quality refer to the improvement of color, without changing the other characteristics of economic interest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24478/19818,E-ISSN 1679-0359

37,2016,Dietetic combination of mannan-oligosaccharides and fructooligosaccharides modifies nitrogen metabolism in dogs,"The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of a mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) and a frutoligosaccharide (FOS) mixture in a 1:1 ratio added to a commercial diet for dogs before the extrusion process on the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of the diets and on the metabolizable energy (ME), nitrogen metabolism (postprandial blood urea curve, organic nitrogen balance, fecal concentration of ammonia and excretion of urinary urea) and fecal fermentation parameters (fecal pH and concentrations of short chain fatty acids). Eighteen adult Beagle dogs were used and randomly distributed into two treatments, being a control diet plus one diet in which the mixture of prebiotics was added before the extrusion of the ration. There was no difference in digestibility, metabolizable energy, fecal ammonia content and short-chain fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric) between the control diet and the one with the addition of prebiotics. However, the dogs supplemented with prebiotics before extrusion, had a lower fecal pH (p < 0,05) compared to those in the control diet and a reduction in the post prandial blood urea concentration (p < 0,01) was also observed in the animals receiving prebiotics, observed by the areas below the curve of urea and its increment. The possible mechanism involved in the effect of prebiotics on the reduction in the concentrations of blood urea is the reduction in the formation and intestinal absorption of ammonia, favored by the reduction of intestinal pH. These findings can be considered in the use of prebiotics in clinical nutrition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23983/19788,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Evaluation of grazing beef cows receiving supplements with different protein contents,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with different crude protein contents on the productive performance of grazing beef cows during post-calving. Thirty-six beef cows, with age and average body weight of 5 years and 490±17.9 kg, respectively, were used. The experimental design was completely randomized. The treatments were: control = cows received only mineral mixture ad libitum; supplemented = cows received 1 kg d-1 of supplement containing 80, 200, or 320 g crude protein (CP) kg-1. There was no effect (P ? 0.16) of supplementation on voluntary intake. A linear effect (P < 0.02) of the CP content in the supplements was observed among supplemented cows, only for the CP intake. Supplementation did not affect (P ? 0.20) the total digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein, and CP. Among supplemented cows, a positive linear effect (P < 0.01) of the CP content in the supplement was observed for the CP digestibility. Intestinal flow of microbial nitrogen compounds and efficiency of synthesis microbial were not affected (P ? 0.18) by treatments. Performance, milk yield and composition were not also affected (P ? 0.11) by treatments. Supplementation did not affect (P ? 0.52) non-esterified fatty acids, urea nitrogen and progesterone serum concentrations. It is concluded that supplementation of grazing beef cows during post-calving does not affect nutritional and productive performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24728/19790,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments and six replicates with 20 birds per experimental unit. Concentrations of creatinine, albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, triacylglycerols (TAG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), were evaluated at the ages of 14, 28 and 42 days, with 30 birds evaluated per age. At 14 days, there was no difference serum creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL, triacylglycerols, total proteins or VLDL-C concentrations as compared with control. Albumin concentration was the highest at the MWM inclusion levels of 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0%. At 28 days, triacylglycerols, VLDL-C and LDL-C were the lowestat 7.5% inclusion whereas at 42 days, these same variables were the lowest with addition of 10.0% meal. At 14, 28 and 42 days of age, the VLDL-C, LDL-C and total TAG contents were found to decrease at mango waste meal inclusion levels of 5.0 and 7.5% in the diets, which maybe considered an indicator of improvements in the metabolic conditions of broilers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23979/19821,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Performance and carcass traits of different commercial pig lines,"The study objective was to evaluate the performance and the quantitative and qualitative carcass traits of three different commercial pig lines. Seventy-two animals were included, 24 animals of each lineage, 36 females and 36 immunocastrated males, with an initial and final average weight of 26 ± 6.5 kg and 139.49 ± 4.05 kg, respectively. These animals were identified and distributed in randomised blocks in a 2 x 3 factorial analysis (two sexes and three lineages) with three replicates per treatment and four animals per experimental unit.

37,2016,Introduction of sugar cane bagasse pellets in diets devoid of long fiber for feedlots finished steers,"The use of diets without roughage in beef feedlot has become common in recent years due to practicality, feasibility and availability of inputs. However, the introduction of roughage that does not harm the operation of the feeding management can bring health benefits to animals and economic gain. This study aimed to evaluate the productive and economic performance of steers finished in feedlot, fed three levels of sugar cane bagasse pellets (SBP) in diets without long-fiber. The treatments consisted of 0%, 7% and 14% of SBP in a mixture of concentrate, comprising 80% whole corn grain plus 20% of a protein core. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. The diet with 0% of SBP promoted lower dry matter intake and weight gain. Feed conversion was similar between treatments, with an average of 6.21 kg-1. The lower dry matter digestibility was found in the diet with 14% of SBP. The introduction of SBP did not change the rumination, averaging 1.9 hours day-1. Animals fed 7% of SBP showed higher fat thickness. Due to the numerical differences between treatments for feed conversion in housing and daily cost of food, the profit margin was maximal in the diet with 0% of SBP, with values of R$ 338.1; R$ 311.6 and R$ 305,1 per animal, respectively 0%, 7% and 14% of SBP. The introduction of SBP promoted improvements in production performance, but did not improve the economic results of steers finished in feedlot.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23914/19822,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A completely randomized design in a factorial 2x2x2, were used, with two levels of protein-energy supplementation, two sex and two genetic groups. Fifty-six animals were used (28 Nellore and 28 crossbred ½ Nellore x ½ Aberdeen Angus), equally divided between males and females, maintained on grazing Brachiariabrizanthacv. Marandu and evaluated in three experimental periods: period 1 = protein-energy supplementation in the dry season; period 2 = protein-energy supplementation during the rainy season; period 3 = only mineral supplementation. In the dry season, they were supplemented with levels of 0.5 and 1% of body weight (BW) and in the rainy season with 0 and 1% BW. Dry matter intake (kg day-1, % BW, g kgBW0.75-1) was estimated. In vivo ultrasound measurements of carcass were: loin eye area (LEA), fat thickness (FT) and rump fat thickness (RFT). There was influence of genetic group and protein-energy supplementation levels on average daily gain (ADG) of animals in period 1 and 2 (P < 0.05). Sex affected the ADG only in period 2, and the males had 754 gday-1 and females, 582 g day-1. There was no interaction of genetic group x sex x supplementation level. At the end of the experimental period (end of period 3), it was found that male animals and crossbred animals ½ Nellore x ½ Aberdeen Angus had higher ADG (716 and 748 g day-1, respectively). The values of dry matter intake (DMI) were influenced by genetic group and sex, in all periods, verifying highest intake in crossbred animals ½ Nellore x ½ Aberdeen Angus, with better feed conversion for crossbred animals. Regarding ultrasound measurements taken on the carcass, the influence of sex on FT and RFT, it was observed, and the males showed higher values, 3.24 and 4.62 mm, respectively. LEA was influenced by protein-energy supplementation levels in the second period, herein animals receiving 1% of BW, showed higher values (56.04 cm2) than those receiving 0.5% of BW supplement (48.38 cm2).

37,2016,Carcass and non-carcass characteristics of sheep fed on annatto byproduct,"Annatto byproduct is the residue from the extraction of powder dye that covers the seed pericarp; after processing, between 94% and 98% of the original product is considered a byproduct. The aim was to evaluate the influence of increasing levels of annatto byproduct on the components of sheep body weight. Thirty-two male sheep, not castrated, with initial weight of 23.17 ± 1.45 kg, without a defined breed, were used in randomized blocks in all four treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 g kg?1 of annatto byproduct in the diet dry matter). The increase to 300 g kg?1 of annatto byproduct had a negative linear effect (P < 0.05) for hot carcass weight (kg) and cold carcass weight (kg). Increasing levels of annatto byproduct resulted in a linear reduction (P < 0.05) for palette weight (kg), leg weight (kg), carcass compactness index (kg cm?1), liver weight (kg) and skin weight (kg). The inclusion of annatto byproduct up to 200 g kg?1 of dry matter in sheep diets did not affect the components of sheep body weight.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23553/19784,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Root system and resistance to penetration of Mombaça grass fertilized with nitrogen and irrigated,"High stocking rates in intensive pasture-based animal production systems may compromise the development of the forage roots due to increased resistance in the surface layer. This study tested the hypothesis that an increase in stocking rate resulting from different levels of nitrogen fertilization in irrigated Mombaça grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Mombaça) pasture under intermittent grazing could increase resistance to penetration and consequently the growth of the root system. A split-plot design with randomized blocks and subplots was used, including three replications and the following four treatments: 0, 200, 400 and 800 kg N ha?1 year. Evaluations performed in spring, summer and fall seasons were assigned as subplots. The highest values for area, diameter, length and percentage of root biomass (91.4%) were concentrated at the 0-10 cm soil depth, which is explained by the lower penetration resistance in this layer. Increased stocking rate resulting from increased levels of nitrogen in the Mombaça grass sward does not directly affect the penetration resistance of the soil or root characteristics. However, in the rainy season, higher nitrogen levels lead to increased resistance, as they provide higher cumulative stocking rates in this period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21502/19779,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,In vitro kinetic parameters of marandu palisadegrass associated with nonfiber carbohydrates,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different levels (0, 10, 20 and 30%) of starch or glucose associated with marandu palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) on its kinetic parameters and fiber digestion by the in vitro gas production technique. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design, with four treatments and six replications for each energy source. The marandu palisadegrass associated with nonfiber carbohydrate levels was incubated in 120 ml bottles, with McDougall buffer and rumen fluid from two rumen-cannulated sheep. Readings were taken of gas pressure within the bottle, and two vials were removed at 24, 48 and 96 hours (h) to assess residual neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The one-pool logistic model was used to estimate the kinetic parameters for pure forage and forage associated with starch, however it was necessary to use the two-pools model when glucose was added. Each 1% of added starch promoted a linear increase in total gas production of 0.2254 ml and a decrease in lag time of 0.2451 h, but did not affect the digestion rate. Glucose levels had a quadratic effect on digestion rate and lag time, with a minimum estimated value for digestion rate of 0.01689 h-1 at a glucose level of 10.07% and a minimum lag time of zero. Starch levels caused a linear reduction in NDF digestion of 0.296% only at 24 h, while glucose levels linearly reduced the NDF digestion in all evaluated times (0.3269, 0.4171 and 0.2340% at 24, 48 and 96 h, respectively). Glucose levels promoted different effects on the in vitro gas production kinetic parameters of marandu palisadegrass compared to starch supplementation, highlighting the prolonged negative effects on NDF digestion.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22994/19780,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Forage production in a natural grassland with limestone and phosphorus dosages,"The objective of this study was to assess forage production in a natural grassland by applying different doses of limestone and phosphorus, and the influence of these applications on soil profile. The treatments consisted of the application of limestone doses of 0.0, 7.2, and 14.4 t ha-1 and phosphorus doses of 0,35, 70, and 140 kg of P2O5 ha-1 on the soil surface. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with split-plots and three replications. The limestone doses were distributed in the main plot and applied only at the beginning of the experiment, whereas the phosphorus doses were distributed in the subplots with subsequent annual maintenance applications. Was used a ruler (cm) for monitoring the growth of pastures and, when grasses reached an average height of 20 cm, forage samples were collected in each subplot and botanical and morphological components were separated and dried until a constant weight was achieved. In the third and fourth assessment years, soil samples were collected in the 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20-cm layers to evaluate the influence of treatments on the chemical properties of the soil. The variables analyzed were related to the production of several components, including fodder, native grasses, leguminous plants, unwanted plants, and dead material, in addition to soil properties such as pH, exchangeable aluminum concentration, and base saturation. There was no interaction between the limestone and phosphorus treatments. The effect of limestone doses on forage production was assessed in the third year, and, in the following year, the intermediate dose of limestone (7.2 t ha-1) produced the highest yield (2,316.1 kg of dry matter [DM] of forage ha-1). The increase in phosphorus doses increased forage production in the second year, and reached yields of up to 2,232 Kg DM ha-1 in the fourth year. In summary, the production of natural pastures was enhanced by the application of 25% of the recommended dose of limestone (7.2 t ha-1), and by the application of 50% of the recommended dose of phosphorus (70 kg P2O5 ha-1). The increase in limestone doses directly affected the chemical properties of the soil by decreasing acidity and exchangeable aluminum, and increasing base saturation, even in deeper layers (0-20 cm). The increase in phosphorus doses did not increase the mobility of this nutrient in the deeper layers of the soil (10-20 cm), and the effects were restricted to a depth of up to 10 cm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23432/19782,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Effect of follicular diameter, time of first cleavage and H3K4 methylation on embryo production rates of Bos indicus cattle","This study aimed investigate the relationship between epigenetics, follicular diameter and cleavage speed, by evaluating the developmental potential and occurence of H3K4 monomethylation of early-, intermediate- and late-cleaving Bos indicus embryos from in vitro fertilized oocytes originating from follicles up to 2 mm in diameter or between 4 and 8 mm in diameter. Oocytes (n = 699) from small follicles (? 2 mm) and 639 oocytes from large follicles (4-8 mm) were punched from 1,982 Bos indicus’ slaughterhouse ovaries. After maturation and in vitro fertilization (IVF), the cultured embryos were separated into early (? 28 h post-IVF), intermediate (> 28 h and ? 34 h post-IVF) and late (> 34 h and ? 54 h post-IVF) cleavage groups. Blastocysts were subjected to an immunofluorescence assessment for H3K4me investigation. The blastocyst rate for large follicles (36.3%) was higher than that for small follicles (22.9%, P < 0.05). In addition, blastocyst rates for early and intermediate cleavage groups (45.3% and 33.8%, respectively) were higher than that for late cleavage group (13.5%, P < 0.05). The blastocysts from all groups displayed H3K4me staining by immunofluorescence, particularly intense in what seemed to be trophectoderm cells and weak or absent in cells seemingly from the inner cell mass. For the first time for indicus embryos, data from this study demonstrate that higher blastocyst embryo rates are obtained from embryos that cleave within 34 h after fertilization and from those produced from follicles of 4-8 mm in diameter, indicating a greater ability of these embryos to develop to the stage of embryonic preimplantation. This is the first article demonstrating the occurrence of H3K4me in cattle embryos; its presence in all the evaluated blastocysts suggests that this histone modification plays a key role in maintaining embryo viability at preimplantation stage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23616/19819,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Marandu Syn. Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu during the different seasons of the year, in locations closer to or farther from feces deposited by cattle in pastures. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with four replicates. The following response-variables were calculated: phyllochron (PHYL), leaf appearance rate (LAR), leaf elongation rate (LER), stem elongation rate (SER), leaf senescence rate (LSR), life span of the leaf (LSL), stem length (SL), leaf blade length (LBL), number of dead leaves per tiller (NDLT), and number of living leaves per tiller (NLLT). Farther from the feces, a larger phyllochron period was observed in all seasons. The LSL was greater in winter, especially farther from feces. Closer to feces, higher values were observed for LAR, LER and LBL compared with the sites farther from feces. The SL, SER, and NLLT were lower in the winter compared with the other seasons. In the summer, a greater NDLT value was observed than in the other seasons. The deposition of feces by cattle and the seasons of the year both affect the morphogenesis of B. brizantha cv.

37,2016,Splenic lesions observed in 71 splenectomized dogs: a retrospective study,"The spleen of dogs is frequently affected by disorders that vary from local and systemic origin. The difficulty in associating clinical and gross findings contributes for the choice of total splenectomy as the main treatment, leading to an impairment of the immune and hematopoietic functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathological findings in the spleen of splenectomized dogs during 2008 to 2014 at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital. From the 71 cases analyzed, 97% (69/71) of the dogs were submitted to total splenectomy and 3% (2/71) to partial splenectomy. In 45 (63.4%) of these cases, the histopathological diagnosis was non-neoplastic alterations; only 36.6% (26/71) had a splenic neoplasia. The main non-neoplastic lesions observed were nodular hyperplasia 24.4% (11/45), infarction 22.3% (10/45), and hematoma 20% (9/45). The most frequent tumors were hemangiosarcoma 50% (13/26), histiocytic sarcoma 23% (6/26), and lymphoma 11.5% (3/26).

37,2016,RAPD-based genotyping of Malassezia pachydermatis from Domestic and wild animals,"Malassezia pachydermatis (M. pachydermatis) is a fungus of importance in human and veterinary medicine. Although a part of the normal microbiota, it can sometimes be present in its pathogenic form, particularly causing otitis and dermatitis in animals. Among human beings, it mainly affects immune compromised patients and newborns, causing simple pustulosis, seborrheic dermatitis, tinea versicolor or fungemia. This study aimed to analyze the genomic polymorphism in M. pachydermatis samples isolated from Canis familiaris (domestic dog), Felis catus (domestic cat), and Myrmecophaga tridactyla (giant anteater). Two hundred and fourteen samples were collected and cultured in Sabouraud agar with chloranphenicol (100mg L-1) and incubated at 37 °C for a period of 7 to 10 days. One hundred and sixty six samples that appeared morphologically comparable to yeast cultures were processed for DNA extraction and PCR was performed for a specific region in the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) of M. pachydermatis. Among these, seven (4.21%) were negative and 159 (95.79%) were positive. Of the 159 positive samples, 102 (64.15%) were from animals with clinical signs and 57 (35.85%) without clinical signs. Fifty-seven samples were selected at random for RAPD-PCR based genotyping and distributed into four genetic groups. Types I and II were more frequent in animals with clinical signs while type III was frequent in healthy animals. Type IV occurred evenly across animals with or without clinical signs. These results indicate differences in pathogenicity of the fungus based on the genotype.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23471/19769,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Risk factors for diarrhea in a cohort of dairy heifer calves reared in individual outdoor hutches in Piraí, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","This study aimed to evaluate the association between diarrhea and risk factors potentially related to diarrhea incidence, such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Eimeria and nematode infection, animal age, failure to transfer passive immunity, type of fertilization (artificial insemination - AI, in vitro production of embryos - IVP and natural breeding), mother (heifer/cow) and birth weight of heifer calves reared in individual outdoor hutches on a dairy farm. The database used in the present study refers to a weekly survey of a cohort of 118 heifer calves from birth to 100 days of age. A logistic generalized additive model (GAM) was fit to evaluate the functional relationship between the risk of diarrhea occurrence and birth weight. For analysis purposes, the database was divided into calves up to 30 days old and calves 31 to 100 days old. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models via generalized estimating equations. All variables were included in the models and were removed oneby-one according to Wald statistics to obtain the final model. The relative risks (RR) and their respective 90% confidence intervals were estimated. The final model for calves up to 30 days old showed that IVP [RR=0.33 (90% CI 0.14; 0.75)] is a protective factor and that Cryptosporidium spp. infection [RR=1.95 (90% CI 1.22; 3.12)] is a risk factor. Although not statistically significant [RR=1.46 (90% CI 0.98; 2.18)], failure to transfer passive immunity increases the risk of diarrhea. The final model for calves 31 - 100 days old showed that IVP [RR=0.50 (90% IC 0.28; 0.89)] and birth weight ? 40 kg [RR=0.65 (90% CI 0.47; 0.89)] are protective factors. In this age group, Cryptosporidium spp. infection has no statistical significance [RR=1.25 (90% CI 0.95; 1.64)]. These results indicate that some of the diarrhea episodes observed in animals up to 30 days old could be explained by Cryptosporidium infection; therefore, better monitoring of these animals is recommended. Greater care in colostrum administration is suggested because animals with hypoglobulinemia are more sensitive to diarrhea occurrence. Although attention should be given to all animals with a low birth weight, special care should be given to those 31 to 100 days old.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23439/19820,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Leptospirosis and brucellosis seroepidemiology in sheep and dogs from non-mechanized rural properties in the northwestern region in the state of Paraná,"Sheep breeding has been important in agribusiness, transforming the Brazilian productive scenario. However, it is still deficient due to the damages caused by infectious diseases. Leptospirosis is a severe disease with global distribution, caused by bacteria from the Leptospira genre affecting both humans and animals. The general infection is unapparent, or its clinical signs, when present, are similar to other infections. Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria from the Brucella genre responsible for reproductive disorders in animals, especially ruminants. The purpose of this paper was to seroepidemiological study of Leptospira spp. and Brucella ovis in sheep and dogs from nonmechanized rural properties from the northwestern region in the state of Paraná, Brazil. In order to detect anti-Leptospira antibodies, microscopic agglutination (MAT) was performed. For anti-Brucella antibodies, the agar gel immunodiffusion assay (AGID) was performed. From the total 542 samples from sheep sera analyzed, 11.25% were considered reagent to Leptospira spp. and 18.26% to Brucella ovis. From the 36 dog samples, 25% were reagent to MAT and AGID. From the 32 properties analyzed, 75% were considered positive for leptospirosis and 56.25% for brucellosis. Antibodies against the most probable serovars were Hardjo (34.42%) and Butembo (44.44%) in sheep and dogs, respectively, and the variable exchange of animals among properties was associated to leptospiric infection (p=0.028) in sheep. Leptospirosis and brucellosis are present in the sheep herd and dogs in the rural properties studied, and such result is a warning of the zoonotic importance and the need to establish sanitary programs directed to these animal species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23323/19815,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Long-axis fractional shortening and mitral annulus motion in dogs,"Ventricular systolic dynamics involves the contraction of transverse and longitudinal myocardial fibers. Unfortunately, only the activity of the transverse myocardial fibers is foreseen by the standard systolic echocardiographic parameters. Although strain and strain rate have been used to assess the radial, circumferential and longitudinal planes of cardiac contraction, such analysis requires advanced equipment which is not always available in veterinary medicine. On the contrary, some unusual parameters may be recorded via standard methodology, allowing for the specific evaluation of left ventricular longitudinal contractility. In this study, the longitudinal contractile activity was evaluated using the long-axis fractional shortening and the mitral annulus motion, which were compared with several standard echocardiographic parameters in 14 beagles, including seven with asymptomatic mitral valve disease. The long-axis fractional shortening was positively correlated with both the mitral annulus motion and the end-diastolic left-ventricular diameter. Also, a significant correlation was found to exist between the mitral annulus motion and the left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter, which is likely supportive of its preload dependency. Even though no difference was documented in either mitral annulus motion or long-axis fractional shortening between healthy dogs and dogs with mitral valve disease, the latter only included animals with minimal cardiac remodeling, with no overt compromise of systolic function. Since it is possible to obtain these two parameters with any echocardiographic equipment, their inclusion in the routine exam would probably add information regarding the activity of the longitudinal myocardial fibers, whose functional deterioration supposedly occurs prior to the impairment of transverse fibers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22752/19764,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Molecular detection of Bluetongue Virus (BTV) and Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) in uterine biopsies of dairy cows with or without reproductive problems,"Reproductive performance of dairy cows has a direct impact on herd productivity. Infectious agents, such as Bluetongue Virus (BTV) and Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV), are associated with reproductive failure. However, it remains unknown if these viruses are present in the uterus and cause gestational loss. This study used molecular methods to assess if BTV and BLV can be detected in the uterus of serologically positive dairy cows with a record of abortions, stillbirths and repeat breeding (n=23) and without a record of reproductive problems (n =23). The cows came from three dairy herds of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. BTV was not detected in any of the uterine biopsies. Proviral DNA of BLV was detected in 54.5 % of the seropositive cows, but positivity for BLV in the uterus was not associated with the existence of reproductive problems. In conclusion, this study shows that BLV, but not BTV, is present in the uterus of seropositive cows, regardless of reproductive performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23067/19765,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Assessment of different cut-off values of the ELISA-Typhimurium for the discrimination of swine herds with Salmonella isolation,"Salmonella control programs require the classification of positive herds according with the prevalence of infected pigs. This must be based on diagnostic methods that are reliable, accurate and cost effective. Since serological methods fulfill most of these prerequisites, many countries have adopted indirect ELISA tests to discriminate herds, based on their seroprevalence. In view of that, an in-house indirect ELISA test (ELISA-Typhimurium) previously developed proved to be able to detect sera antibodies against the most prevalent serovars of Salmonella found in Brazilian pig farms. This study aimed to assess different cut-off values of the ELISA-Typhimurium in terms of their correlation with Salmonella isolation results at the herd level. Blood and mesenteric lymph node or rectal swabs were taken from 56 slaughter and 14 grower batches from different farms. Serum was tested using the ELISA-Typhimurium at different cut-off points (OD: 6.87%-40%). A total of 55 slaughter batches had at least one Salmonella-positive sample, and the within-herd prevalence was 64.9% (SE±24.8). All 14-grower batches were negative on Salmonella isolation. The logistic regression demonstrated that at 20% OD the ELISA-Typhimurium test is the best model to predict Salmonella isolation frequency at the herd level. At this cut-off point, the test may be a helpful tool for discriminating Salmonella infected herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22624/19812,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effects and costs of a strategic selective treatment for controlling ecto - and hemoparasitosis in Holstein Friesian calves,"This work assessed the effectiveness and net operational costs of a strategic selective treatment for controlling ectoparasites (Rhipicephalus microplus, as well as Dermatobia hominis and Cochliomyia hominivorax larvae) and hemoparasites (Anaplasma marginale and Babesia spp.) in Holstein Friesian calves. Thirty calves were equally distributed in two groups: ST) strategic selective treatment and CT) conventional treatment. From birth, calves were monitored biweekly until 12 months of age. The CT group was subjected to parasite control according to directions provided by the veterinarian at the Experimental Farm of the Federal University of Lavras (FE/UFLA), whereas parasite control of the ST group followed criteria we had previously established. The ST group experienced fewer changes in physical traits on average and lower globular volume (GV) than the CT group (p < 0.05). Approximately 23% of ST calves exhibited external omphalitis, compared with 48% CT calves (p < 0.001). Additionally, ST calves were less affected than CT calves (p < 0.05) by R. microplus females and D. hominis larvae. Seropositivity rates from the indirect immunofluorescence reaction for A. marginale and B. bovis were similar for both groups (ST: 85.6% and 87.8%, respectively; CT: 83.2% and 83.2%). Additionally, subclinical (asymptomatic infection) anaplasmosis predominated in both groups during the dry period of the year. The daily average weight gains (DWG) were identical among ST (580 g) and CT (570 g), but the effective operational cost (EOC) was 3.7 times greater in ST (R$ 406.58/animal) compared with CT (R$ 110.90/animal). Laboratory exams to monitor the animals represented the largest share of the cost (82.7%) in ST, whereas drug expenses represented the highest costs (49.8%) in CT. Despite having a greater EOC, ST was more efficient at reducing parasite burdens than CT. Calves in the former group presented fewer R. microplus or D. hominis, and experienced a lower percentage of hemolytic anemia (VG < 24%). However, ST no affected the dynamic of A. marginale- and B. bovis-related infections, indicating that the FE/UFLA may be characterized as enzootically stable for these species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23158/19766,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Risk factors associated with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) infection in the semiarid of the state of Paraíba, in the northeast region of Brazil","Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has become an important viral infectious agent in cows and is considered endemic in many regions. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological status of BVDV in bovine herds in the semiarid state of Paraíba, in northeastern Brazil, by determining the frequency of anti-BVDV antibodies and risk factors associated with the infection. We tested 359 cows from 20 farms. Three had a history of clinically suspected bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) or mucosal disease (MD), whereas the other 17 locations were randomly selected. Detection of anti-BVDV antibodies was performed by indirect ELISA using a commercial kit (IDEXX BVDV p80 Ab Test). Risk factor analysis was performed in two steps, univariate and multivariate analysis. Seven samples were considered suspicious and were excluded from the analysis of seropositive animals. Of 352 animals, 141 (40.1 %; CI 95 % = 34. 9% – 45.2 %) were seropositive. Of the 20 farms analyzed, 19 (95%) had seropositive animals and the frequency of seropositivity per farm varied between 4.5 % and 85.7 %. The risk factors identified were as follows: area ? 120 hectares (OR = 3.06; CI 9 5% = 1.43 – 6.53), high animal density (OR = 3.48; CI 95 % = 1.24-9.79), weaning age ? 60 days (OR = 10.99; CI 95 % = 1.31-91.9), exchange of animals (OR = 4.95; CI 95 % = 2.08-11.8), calf mortality > 5% (OR = 2.33; CI 95 % = 1.07-5.11), and use of natural breeding and artificial insemination (OR = 3.06; CI 95 % = 1.22 – 7.67). It was suggested that to avoid the transmission of BVDV infection in bovine herds in the Sertão of Paraíba, it is important to prevent identified associated risk factors and to perform further studies, identifying persistently infected animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22493/19762,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. in domestic dogs from Toledo, Paraná, Brazil","Leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by Leishmania protozoa affecting various vertebrate hosts, including humans and dogs. Dogs represent the most important domestic reservoir of leishmaniasis. For this reason, the aim of this study was to detect the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. in dogs being treated at the veterinary hospital of our institution. Samples were obtained from 175 animals by jugular or cephalic venipuncture, and serum was subsequently separated. Anti-Leishmania spp. IgG antibodies were detected in these specimens using indirect immunofluorescence. This revealed that of the 175 serum samples, those of four (2.28%) animals reacted positively and the antibodies title was 40. These data are consistent with the transmission of Leishmania spp. in the region, suggesting that dogs represent a reservoir of American cutaneous leishmaniasis. This is the first description of circulating antibodies against Leishmania spp. in the West region of Paraná State.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22030/19761,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of natural and artificial drying of leaf biomassof Psidium guajava on the content and chemical composition of essential oil,"Psidium guajava L. is native to Central and South America. It is widely distributed and well adapted to Brazil, a producer of essential oils rich in terpenes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of natural and artificial drying on the content and chemical composition of the essential oil of guava leaves (Psidium guajava L.) grown in Rio Verde (GO). The two treatments consisted of drying fresh leaves either naturally in the shade or artificially at 40°C. Chemical composition was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by gas coupled with mass spectrometer chromatography (GC/MS) and gas chromatography using a flame ionizer (GC-FID), respectively. The method of drying changed the content and chemical composition of the essential oil of guava leaves. Drying in the shade reduced the content and altered the constituents of the essential oil, whereas drying in an oven at 40°C, despite having reduced the amounts of the constituents, exhibited the highest essential oil content and increased the concentration of certain major constituents as compared to that in the natural shade drying method. The major components found in the essential oil of leaves regardless of the drying processes were trans-caryophyllene, ?-humulene, aromadendrene, ?-selinene, and selin-11-en-4?-ol. According to reports in the literature, these compounds possess fungicidal, insecticidal, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activity, among others beneficial actions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23028/19758,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Morphological, morphometric and histochemical aspects of the labial salivary glands of dogs","The knowledge regarding labial salivary glands is becoming progressively more important, as their application in autologous transplantion, to promote ocular surface lubrication, are an ever-increasing procedure in veterinary medicine. In this study the labial salivary gland was collected, as a single piece, along with the oral mucosa from 10 adult dog cadavers. The sample was removed from the left lower lip marked by the second premolar tooth and extended until the distal edge of the second molar. Morphological, morphometric and histochemical evalutations were performed in the rostral, medial and caudal regions of the sample. The study revealed exocrine, compound, tubuloacinar, mixed and predominantly mucous glands with the presence of serous demilunes associated with a few mucous secreting units, and a duct system formed by intralobular intercalated and striated ducts, interlobular ducts, and a main excretory duct. In the rostral region, there was a lower amount of parenchyma compared to other areas, and the diameter of the acini unvaried in all regions. All three regions of the sample were PAS and Alcian blue positive, demonstrating the presence of neutral, carboxylated, and sulphated mucins. Serous demilunes reacted positively to Xylidine Ponceau staining indicating the presence of proteins.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21606/19811,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Efficiency of boiling and four other methods for genomic DNA extraction of deteriorating spore-forming bacteria from milk,"The spore-forming microbiota is mainly responsible for the deterioration of pasteurized milk with long shelf life in the United States. The identification of these microorganisms, using molecular tools, is of particular importance for the maintenance of the quality of milk. However, these molecular techniques are not only costly but also labor-intensive and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of boiling in conjunction with four other methods for the genomic DNA extraction of sporulated bacteria with proteolytic and lipolytic potential isolated from raw milk in the states of Paraná and Maranhão, Brazil. Protocols based on cellular lysis by enzymatic digestion, phenolic extraction, microwave-heating, as well as the use of guanidine isothiocyanate were used. This study proposes a method involving simple boiling for the extraction of genomic DNA from these microorganisms. Variations in the quality and yield of the extracted DNA among these methods were observed. However, both the cell lysis protocol by enzymatic digestion (commercial kit) and the simple boiling method proposed in this study yielded sufficient DNA for successfully carrying out the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the rpoB and 16S rRNA genes for all 11 strains of microorganisms tested. Other protocols failed to yield sufficient quantity and quality of DNA from all microorganisms tested, since only a few strains have showed positive results by PCR, thereby hindering the search for new microorganisms. Thus, the simple boiling method for DNA extraction from sporulated bacteria in spoiled milk showed the same efficacy as that of the commercial kit. Moreover, the method is inexpensive, easy to perform, and much less time-consuming.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/24630/19810,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Soil chemical alterations of a Dystroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol) treated with an alkaline effluent from a pharmaceutical industry,"Effluents from different industrial supply conglomerates are often discarded in the environment without proper treatment. The concern for an economically viable industrial production line, which is both environmentally sound and socially acceptable, is increasing. Some of these effluents are alkaline in nature and may be used as an alternative to chemical conditioners for acidic soils in agricultural systems. This research aimed to evaluate changes in the chemical attributes of a Dystroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol) after application of an effluent from a pharmaceutical industry. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using PVC tubes of 1-m length and a 0.2-m diameter filled with soil and different doses of the effluent. After 3 days, 100 mm of water was applied to each treatment. The PVC tubes were incubated for 30 days; thereafter, the tubes disassembled, and soil chemical analyses were made at different soil depths: 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and 0.8-1.0 m. The effluent applications significantly altered the soil elements in the 0-0.2 m layer, increasing the concentrations of K+, P, Mn2+, Na+, Cu2+, H+, Ca2+, Al3+ and the soil pH. In the subsurface layers, the concentration of the elements Zn2+, Cu2+, K+, and Na+ also changed significantly. In general, the application of pharmaceutical industry residue improved soil chemical attributes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23078/19755,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Chemical properties of an Oxisol after gypsum application,"Gypsum utilization is a critical practice in agriculture because of the high solubility and consequent relative neutralization of subsurface toxic aluminum. However, it has been observed that in most cases, gypsum is being randomly utilized without scientifically established parameters or even the need to use it as a soil amendment at all. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition and electrical conductivity of an Oxisol’s saturation extract under different gypsum doses (0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Mg ha-1). This experiment was conducted in a greenhouse environment. Soil columns (V = 1.57 dm3) were filled with sifted (2 mm) soil collected from the upper layer (0-20 cm). The experimental design adopted was completely randomized with five repetitions. The treatments consisted of a 5 × 2 factorial through five gypsum doses (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Mg ha-1 of gypsum consisting of 224.1 g kg-1 S, 314.8 g kg-1 CaO, and 7 g kg-1 P2O5) and two depth evaluations (0-10 and 10-20 cm). After the treatments, soil from both 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers was removed from the columns, sifted once (2 mm), and subjected to vacuum extraction to assess the saturation extract. The data acquired was processed and submitted to variance analysis (when due) and adjusted to regression equations when statistically relevant. Significant increases were observed for Ca, Mg, K, P, and S, although Al, Si, and pH presented no statistically significant difference. The electrical conductivity value of this soil in particular is directly related to the gypsum dose.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23022/19754,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Glycerol as a cryoprotectant agent to the entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis spp. and Steinernema spp.,"The difficulty of storage and conservation of entomopathogenic nematodes (ENPs) is one of the major obstacles for the expansion of its use in the control of biological pest and in the maintenance of collections of these organisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate cryopreservation as a storage and conservation method for ENPs, using glycerol as cryoprotectant. Infective juveniles (IJs) of the species Heterorhabditis amazonensis (RSC 05), H. bacteriophora (HP88), Steinernema feltiae (Sn) and S. carpocapse (IBCB-n02) were subjected to the following treatments: (A) immersion in glycerol at different concentrations (10, 13 and 15%); (B) different exposure times of the isolates to glycerol (24 and 48 hours); and (C) two freezing times in liquid nitrogen (LN) at –196 ºC (24 and 168 hours). Each treatment was replicated four times, and the design was completely randomized in a factorial 3x2x2 (glycerol concentrations x glycerol exposure time x freezing time in LN). IJs survival was evaluated after each exposure time to glycerol and freezing time in LN. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were compared by the Tukey test. S. feltiae and S. carpocapse survived when exposed to glycerol at 10, 13 and 15% for 24 and 48 hours. After storage in LN for 24 and 168 hours, only S. feltiae survived when exposed to glycerol for 48 hours at concentrations of 10, 13 and 15%, with 40.5; 58.2; and 57.7% survival, respectively. S. feltiae was able to infect Galleria mellonella larvae after freezing. However, for the freezing time of 168 hours, 90% reduction in infectivity was observed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/23000/19753,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Genetic divergence among accessions of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) sampled in the Tapajós region, State of Pará, using agronomic characters and microsatellite markers","The aim of this work was to estimate the genetic divergence among accessions of cassava sampled in the Tapajós region in the State of Pará, Brazil, and conserved at the Regional Germplasm Bank of Eastern Amazon, using agronomic descriptors and molecular markers. Twenty-two accessions of cassava were evaluated in the field for two successive years, based on six agronomic descriptors in twelve-months-old plants without a specific experimental design. Accessions were also evaluated with eleven microsatellite loci in an automatic DNA analyser. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Based on principal components analysis, the character weight of the aerial portion of the plant contributed most to the phenotypical variation. The six traits were used in the analysis of genetic dissimilarity between accessions, and the correlation between matrices generated by morphological and molecular data was estimated. The matrices of genetic dissimilarity were used in the construction of dendrograms using the UPGMA method. We observed a high variation of agronomical descriptors and molecular markers evaluated, which were capable to separate the accessions into distinct groups. A weak positive correlation was detected among the two matrices of genetic distances, which indicates the possibility to explore the genetic diversity using crossings and accessions Amarelinha 36 and Olho roxo 13 are divergent and potentially promising for the generation of heterotic hybrids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22958/19751,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Adsorption of cadmium and copper in representative soils of Eastern Amazonia, Brazil","Studies of heavy metals adsorption in soil play a key role in predicting environmental susceptibility to contamination by toxic elements. The objective of this study was to evaluate cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) adsorption in surface and subsurface soil. Samples of six soils: Xanthic Hapludox (XH1 and XH2), Typic Hapludox (TH), Typic Rhodudalf (TR), Typic Fluvaquent (TF), and Amazonian dark earths (ADE) from Eastern Amazonian, Brazil. The soils were selected for chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization and to determine the adsorption by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. All soils characterized as kaolinitic, and among them, XH1 and XH2 showed the lowest fertility. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms revealed a higher Cu (H curve) than Cd (L curve) adsorption. Parameters of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms indicate that soils TR, TF and ADE has the greatest capacity and affinity for metal adsorption. Correlation between the curve adsorption parameters and the soil attributes indicates that the pH, CEC, OM and MnO variables had the best influence on metal retention. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms satisfactorily described Cu and Cd soil adsorption, where TR, TF and ADE has a lower vulnerability to metal input to the environment. Besides the pH, CEC and OM the MnO had a significant effect on Cu and Cd adsorption in Amazon soils.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22967/19752,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Pressure compensation by a floppy disk in a sprinkler with rotation by centrifugal action,"Water wastage is a great concern worldwide. Water is effectively utilized by using equipment and systems that have more uniform water distribution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the FR Super 10 sprinkler with a pressure compensator under different pressures, spacing, and installation heights. The tests were performed in the laboratory, and pressure was controlled with two gauges calibrated with a mercury column. The distribution uniformity was measured using the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC) and distribution uniformity coefficient (CUD). Four spray nozzles were utilized for the Super 10 sprinkler, at two heights (0.6 and 1.2 m), six pressures (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 m H2O), and six spacings (9 × 9, 9 × 10, 10 × 10, 9 × 12, 10 × 12, and 12 × 12 m). The blue, yellow, and red nozzles presented self-compensating features and the green nozzle was not fully self-compensating. The manufacturing coefficients of variations were lower in the nozzles with smaller apertures (blue and yellow) compared to those with larger apertures. Increasing the sprinkler height provided better water distribution uniformity and a better radial distribution profile, lowering the application rate near the sprinkler. Since this sprinkler compensates for pressure changes, pressure did not influence the sprinkler range.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22625/19748,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Shading of stock plants and the use of auxin in red pitaya cuttings,"Although there has been a significant expansion of red pitaya cultivation in Brazil and other countries around the world, its cultivation requires scientific expertise to identify the plant production systems best suited to Brazilian soils and climate. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of exogenous auxin and shading of the parental stock plants on the subsequent quality of red pitaya cuttings. The use of a commercial rooting auxin (with and without) and five shading levels on stock plants (full sun, 35, 50, 65 and 80% shading) were tested via four randomized blocks in a factorial 2x5 scheme with two plants per plot. After 90 days, the following vegetative characteristics were evaluated: length of the longest root (LR), root dry mass (RDM), root width (RW), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and shoot dry weight (SDW), total dry weight (TDW), number of axillary shoots (NAS), sum of the length of the axillary shoots (SLAS), and shoot:root ratio (SRR). We concluded that for the production of high quality plants, collecting cuttings from stock plants grown in full sun or 80% shade is recommended, eliminating the need to use commercial rooting auxin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22865/19750,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Micropropagation of Agapanthus umbellatus var. minor by using two systems of multiplication,"For conventional micropropagation methods, semisolidified medium (SM) is used; the use of this medium requires intense manipulation of the cultures and skilled labor. Systems that use liquid medium show equal or better efficiency of the multiplication process, besides reducing the cost for the elimination of agar. In this study, we evaluated the mass propagation of Agapanthus umbellatus var. minor two in vitro multiplication systems (SM system and temporary immersion system [SIT]). The plant material was grown in MS medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA; 0.0, 8.9, 17.8, and 35.6 ?M). The data obtained in this study demonstrate that the two systems used were efficient for the multiplication phase of this species. However, we recommend SIT in view of its reuse in the process of multiplication and rooting. Moreover, simple construction, low cost of the culture medium, and low cost of the bioreactors and the fact that agar is not required qualify this system as an efficient alternative for large-scale micropropagation of Agapanthus umbellatus var. minor. We recommend 17.8 ?M 6-BA for the SM system and 8.9 ?M 6-BA for SIT.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22608/19746,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Wheat production performance in response to nitrogen sidedressing and molybdenum leaf application,"The application of nitrogen (N) at the appropriate time can be effective for crop productivity, changing the grain yield by increasing yield components. Thus, new alternatives that enable a better application of N fertilizer are sought. The aim of this study was to evaluate the components of yield and productivity of wheat cultivated with different doses of N sidedressing and molybdenum (Mo) via leaf application, using two cultivars, CD 150 and Quartzo. The experiment was conducted in the crop years of 2013 and 2014. The experiment used a randomized, factorial 4 x 4 block design, with four replicates. Four doses of N sidedressing in the form of urea were applied (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg ha-1) during tillering. In the same period, leaf molybdic fertilizer was applied, using four dosages of Mo in the form of potassium molybdate (0, 20, 40, and 60 g ha-1). Grain number per ear (GNPE), 1,000-grain mass (TGM), hectoliter weight (HW), and grain productivity (PROD) were evaluated. N fertilizer sidedressing did not promote the yield components of either of the wheat cultivars, although the GNPE of the Quartzo cultivar increased with increasing N doses in both crop years. The increase in N fertilizer increased the PROD of both wheat cultivars. The foliar application of Mo did not promote the yield components or wheat PROD of either cultivar. The HW was influenced by N and Mo rates, and was reduced in the absence of either of these fertilizer elements, indicating that the two nutrients were dependent on each other.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22824/19749,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Growth regulators and substrates for Oncidium baueri Lindl. micropropagation,"An adequate concentration of growth regulators as well as the replacement of agar by an alternative medium may be promising from practical and financial points of view to produce orchid plants by micropropagation. The objective of this work was to evaluate different concentrations of growth regulator and alternative substrates for agar replacement in culture medium for in vitro multiplication and rooting of Oncidium baueri. In the explant multiplication phase, two experimental factors were evaluated- various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg L-1) and substrates (agar, vermiculite, and coconut fiber) added to MS medium. In the rooting phase, different concentrations of indole butyric acid (IBA) (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg L-1) were added to culture medium containing the same substrate. Six months after the experiments were initiated, the survival percentage, number of leaves, shoots, and roots and length of the aerial part and the major root were evaluated. The results suggested that addition of 1.0 mg L-1 BAP is necessary for the O. baueri in vitro multiplication phase, but IBA is not necessary in the rooting phase. For the substrate, vermiculite is not indicated as an agar replacement. In contrast, coconut fiber can be used in both multiplication and rooting phases of Oncidium baueri in vitro culture.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22291/19744,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Herbicide selectivity in the early development of Alexander palm and peach palm,"Herbicides are an efficient weed-control method, and herbicide selectivity with regard to palm species is an important subject of agricultural research. Owing to a lack of studies in the literature regarding the use of herbicides on palm trees, especially during the early stages of growth, the present study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of some herbicides during the early development of Alexander palm (Archontophoenix alexandrae) and peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) seedlings. The study was conducted in two seasons in a completely randomized design with eight treatments and four repetitions. The herbicide treatments and dosages (g i.a. ha-1), were as follows: fluazifop-p-butyl (93.8), sethoxydim (184.0), quizalofop-p-ethyl (75.0) clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (50.0 + 50.0), fomesafen (225.0), lactofen (168.0), and nicosulfuron (50.0), and a no-herbicide control was included. The seedlings of both types of trees were transplanted into 3.1-L plastic containers. In the first study, herbicide was applied to Alexander palm seedlings of 25–30 cm in height. In the second study, herbicide was applied to Alexander palm seedlings of 30–40 cm in height. Herbicide was applied to peach palm tree seedlings of 40–55 cm in height in both studies. In peach palms only, the herbicides caused slight visible damage during early development. Collectively, the results suggested that all herbicides used are selective and can be used on peach palms during the various stages of development when there are one to four leaves. For Alexander palms, fluazifop-p-butyl, quizalofop-p-ethyl, and lactofen were the only herbicides that did not affect early development during the stages when the plant had one to four leaves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22259/19743,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Preliminary design of a coffee harvester,"Design of an agricultural machine is a highly complex process due to interactions between the operator, machine, and environment. Mountain coffee plantations constitute an economic sector that requires huge investments for the development of agricultural machinery to improve the harvesting and post-harvesting processes and to overcome the scarcity of work forces in the fields. The aim of this study was to develop a preliminary design for a virtual prototype of a coffee fruit harvester. In this study, a project methodology was applied and adapted for the development of the following steps: project planning, informational design, conceptual design, and preliminary design. The construction of a morphological matrix made it possible to obtain a list of different mechanisms with specific functions. The union between these mechanisms resulted in variants, which were weighed to attribute scores for each selected criterion. From each designated proposal, two variants with the best scores were selected and this permitted the preparation of the preliminary design of both variants. The archetype was divided in two parts, namely the hydraulically articulated arms and the harvesting system that consisted of the vibration mechanism and the detachment mechanism. The proposed innovation involves the use of parallel rods, which were fixed in a plane and rectangular metal sheet. In this step, dimensions including a maximum length of 4.7 m, a minimum length of 3.3 m, and a total height of 2.15 m were identified based on the functioning of the harvester in relation to the coupling point of the tractor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22611/19808,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effects of water salinity and nitrogen fertilization on the growth and yield of ‘BRS Gabriela’ castor beans,"The castor bean has attracted the attention of many farmers as an alternative crop for the National Program of Biofuel and its extensive use in the ricinochemical industry. The crop requires large planting areas to meet the demands of the fuel market. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of irrigation water salinity and nitrogen fertilization on the growth and production of castor beans, ‘BRS Gabriela’, in a protected environment. The present study was conducted at the Center of Technology and Natural Resources of the Federal University of Campina Grande. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 5 × 4 factorial with three replications and one plant per plot. The treatments consisted of irrigation water with five electrical conductivity (ECw) levels of 0.7, 1.7, 2.7, 3.7, and 4.7 dS m-1 associated with four nitrogen levels of 60, 80, 100, and 120 mg of N kg-1 of soil. The interaction between water salinity and nitrogen rates did not exert significant effects on the variables studied. Increased salinity of irrigation water affected the growth in height and stem diameter of castor beans in all periods, and leaf area from 90 days after sowing. Increased nitrogen levels had a positive effect on leaf area at 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after sowing. The total mass of seeds, one hundred seed mass, yield, and number of fruits per plant decreased with the increase in water salinity, and the total mass of seeds was the most affected variable.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/22444/19745,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,"Application of prediction models of asian soybean rust in two crop seasons, in Londrina, Pr","Predictive models of Asian soybean rust have been described by researchers to estimate favorable responses to epidemics. The prediction strategies are based on weather data obtained during period when initial symptoms of the disease are observed. Therefore, this study will evaluate the application of two prediction models of Asian soybean rust, and compare the results from two harvest seasons. The experiments were carried out during the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons in Londrina, PR. “SIGA spore traps” were installed to monitor the presence of Phakopsora pachyrhizi uredospores, and “Electronic trees,” to collect data on weather variables. Following the detection of the first urediniospores, incidence and disease severity were assessed and compared with the predictions made by the models. The model described by Reis et al. (2004) did not indicate conditions favorable for the development of the first rust lesions following the detection of the first urediniospores during the 2011/2012 season. The premonitory symptoms of rust in the first and second harvest seasons were observed only when the model of Reis et al. (2004) indicated SDVPI close to 15 units. The model of Del Ponte et al. (2006b) overestimated the final rust severity during the two seasons.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/21626/19742,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Periods of weed interference in maize crops cultivated in the first and second cycles,"The interference of weeds in maize production may be reflected in grain yield losses that vary as a function of the density, stage and degree of aggressiveness of the species present. In the agricultural ecosystem, crops and weeds demand light, water, nutrients and space, which are frequently not available in sufficient quantities, leading to competition. The aim of this work was to determine the period of interference of weed plants, in particular of naked crabgrass (Digitaria nuda) on maize crop in the first and second harvest. The treatments were defined as increasing periods of coexistence and increasing control of weed community (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days), two more controls, a control including one with weed control until the end of the culture cycle and another with coexistence until the harvest. For each period, were evaluated the stand of maize plants, length of ear, number of grains per row, number of rows per ear, cob, 100-grain weight, and grain productivity. The data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance using the F test, with average treatments compared using Tukey’s test at 5% probability. Crop productivity was evaluated by means of regressions, the critical periods of interference were estimated. The critical timing of weed removal was 25 days for both harvests. The critical weed free period was 54 and 27 days for the first and second harvest respectively. For the conditions of the first and second harvest, the critical period of weed control was of 29 and 2 days respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20336/19741,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight in muskmelons,"Gummy stem blight, caused by Didymella bryoniae, is the most important fungal diseases of muskmelons cultivated in protected environments in Brazil. Fungicides are used to control this disease, and little is known about the effectiveness of alternative control methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight in four muskmelon hybrids. The hybrids Bonus II, Sunrise, Louis and Prince hakusho were grafted onto the squash hybrid Shelper, which is immune to D. bryoniae. Two experiments were conducted, one in greenhouse with artificial inoculation of the pathogen and the other in protected environment using crop residues and soil infected with the pathogen. Under greenhouse conditions, mycelial discs of the pathogen were inoculated onto the hypocotyl or at the union graft/rootstock region of the grafted plants and onto ungrafted plants of each hybrid. By growing these four melon hybrids in a protected environment, the effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight could be studied. When these melons were grown in the greenhouse or in a protected environment, grafting significantly reduced the growth of gummy stem blight in all four melon hybrids. For grafted hybrid plants inoculated at the hypocotyl, the disease severity decreased by 34.1%, 33.8%, 51.1% and 48.0% for Sunrise, Bonus II, Louis and Prince hakusho, respectively, compared to ungrafted plants. For grafted plants inoculated at the union graft/rootstock region, the disease severity decreased by 54.3%, 57.3%, 54.1% and 44.6%, respectively. For melons grown in protected environments, grafting reduced the severity of gummy stem blight in the four melon hybrids by 34.3%, 34.8%, 45.8% and 49.6%, respectively. Thus, grafting onto immune rootstocks significantly reduced the severity of D. bryoniae in the four muskmelon hybrids grown under greenhouse and protected environment conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/20080/19740,E-ISSN 1679-0359
37,2016,Expected response to early-generation selection for yield and tuber appearance traits in potatoes,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of potato clonal families, and to estimate genetic variance, heritability and the expected response to selection of tuber yield and appearance traits in early generations. Twelve potato families were obtained from crosses between two groups of randomly-selected genotypes, including Eliza, C1730-7-94, and C-1742-8-95 in group 1; and Shepody, Asterix, Caesar, and White Lady in group 2. The crosses were made in factorial design (3 genotypes x4 genotypes), and each family consisted of 75 genotypes. Experiments were conducted in the fall of 2010, with a seedling generation under greenhouse conditions, and in the fall of 2011, with a clonal generation under field condition. High heritability estimates suggest that mild to moderate selection can be applied in the seedling generation to eye depth, eyebrow prominence, tuber curvature, flattening and shape uniformity. The C1742-8-95/White Lady stood out as a superior cross, as did all other crosses with White Lady, regarding tuber appearance and yield traits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/18226/19739,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Acute visceral leishmaniasis in a domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) from the state of Tocantins, Brazil","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is expanding in the Brazilian territory. Dogs are considered an important urban reservoir; however, studies have demonstrated the presence of infected cats in some Brazilian states. This report aimed to describe a case of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum infection in a two-month-old domestic feline from a Brazilian region with a high incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis. The analyzed samples were the cat’s blood, conjunctiva, spleen, liver, popliteal, submandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, skin, lung and kidney. The diagnostic methods were: parasitological examination, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and an immunoflurescence antibody test (IFAT). All tissues were positive. The title obtained using the IFAT was 1:160. The animal was negative for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). This work addresses the first case of feline leishmaniasis in the state of Tocantins, and reveals data that may contribute to the knowledge of the disease, since it has been shown to be able to develop rapidly and fatally in kittens, with the ability to infect several tissues.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34862/25473,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Medulloblastoma in a calf of the flemish breed,"Medulloblastomas are neuroectodermal tumors of embryonic origin developing in cerebellum and spinal cord and have an unusual occurrence. When occurs in cattle, it is observed in neonatal cases, leading to multiple neurological clinical signs. Flemish cattle are considered at risk of extinction and the rare specimens of Brazil are in Lages, Santa Catarina. The case of a two-month-old calf with difficulty to remain in a standing position, imbalance, opisthotonus, strabismus, and broad-based gait is described in this study. The animal was euthanized and the necropsy showed an irregular, whitish pink, and friable mass in the cerebellar vermis region, measuring 5×6×3.8 cm associated with the dilation of the lateral ventricles, which extended through the interventricular foramen, midbrain aqueduct, and fourth ventricle. Histologically, it presented elongated triangular neuronal cells arranged in a dense sheet that sometimes encircled small areas of neuropil to form Homer-Wright pseudorosettes. These tumor characteristics were compatible with a medulloblastoma. The immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of the tumor demonstrated a positive staining for vimentin in neoplastic cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein in neoplastic stromal cells, non-reactive for synaptophysin, and negative for S100 protein and pan-cytokeratin. The histological and topographical characteristics were paramount for determining the medulloblastoma diagnosis and the IHC panel is similar to that observed in other studies. Tumor growth is limited by skull bony structures, allowing determining that the clinical signs expressed by the animal were directly related to the compression of important functional structures due to tumor expansion. Medulloblastoma is an unusual tumor in all animal species, not previously reported in Flemish cattle, and necropsy followed by histopathological examination is essential for diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33545/25433,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Molecular survey of Babesia vogeli and Hepatozoon species in dogs from urban area of Midwestern Brazil,"In Brazil, the most important tickborne pathogens affecting dogs include Babesia vogeli, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Hepatozoon canis, and Mycoplasma haemocanis. Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp., transmitted by ixodid ticks, have been reported to naturally infect dogs and are widespread. The authors aimed to investigate the incidence of B. vogeli and Hepatozoon spp. infection using molecular methods to identify factors associated with the infection in dogs from urban areas of Cuiabá municipality, Midwestern Brazil. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay revealed a prevalence of 9.36% (Confidence Interval-CI 95%; 2.72%; 6.79%) and 9.61% (CI 95%; 7.0%; 13.0%) among dogs for B. vogeli and Hepatozoon, respectively. DNA sequences obtained from 10 Hepatozoon PCR positive samples were sequenced and were identical to one another and, moreover, were 100% (541/541 base of pairs-bp) homologous to the corresponding 18S rDNA sequences of H. canis. Twenty-five dogs (6.02%) generated amplicons using PCR protocols for both organisms, indicating co-infection by these two protozoans. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first molecular survey to consider the entire population of dogs from the study area. Moreover, young dogs (0-12 months of age), as well as animals living in walled houses?without access to the street?were more susceptible to infection with B. vogeli and H. canis, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33461/25432,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Composting of swine waste in the treatment of veterinary drug residues,"The increasing need for animal protein has exerted pressures on the current animal production system. One of the alternatives found by producers to improve animal performance has been the use of veterinary drugs, especially antibiotics. However, its indiscriminate use can be a risk to the environmental balance of the producing locations since Brazil has approximately 42 million pigs. With this herd, pig farming represents a great potential for generating environmental impacts. As an alternative use of the large volume of liquid pig manure generated, many producers have been using this slurry in the soil as a bio fertilizer. Residues of veterinary drugs are capable of accumulation with environmental matrices and leach into water resources. In this sense, it is mandatory to dedicate more efforts on the study of techniques and processes for the treatment of organic effluents contaminated by veterinary drugs. Low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative treatment systems are necessary, in order to minimize the entry of these contaminants into the environment. Therefore, the composting process, defined as aerobic microbial decomposition process of organic matter, can be an alternative for treating the effluents contaminated by veterinary drugs. This review to aims to create awareness in the academic community regarding the veterinary drug residues and their contamination potential in different environmental matrices, as well as evaluating the composting process as a technique to minimize the impacts of the swine activity waste on the environment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33870/25953,E-ISSN 1679-0359

41,2020,"Sero-epidemiological and reproductive survey for alphaherpesvirus infections in horses in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil","Equine alphaherpesvirus is a major pathogen that causes respiratory disorders, abortion, neurological syndromes, and perinatal mortality in horse populations worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine whether the occurrence of anti-alphaherpesvirus antibodies is correlated to reproductive abnormalities in horses in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The virus neutralization was carried out in 322 serological samples from unvaccinated horses from 42 farms located in 16 municipalities in the Microregion of the Vale do Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil. Of these horses, 23.3% (75/322; 95% CI: 18.9-28.4%) were found to be reactive to anti-alphaherpesvirus antibodies. In addition, 61.9% (26/42) of farms had at least one reactive animal, with an inter-herd variation of 5% to 100%. With regard to reproductive rates, herpetic infection was associated with the use of biological reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), which uses natural mating (p = 0.003); history of perinatal mortality (p = 0.004); birth interval greater than two years (p = 0.003); and reproductive seasonality of mares with irregular cycles in the herd (p = 0.041). This is the first report on the identification of horses reactive to anti-alphaherpesvirus antibody in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. From the results obtained, the adoption of prophylactic measures such as vaccination is suggested in order to prevent infection in susceptible animals and to reduce the viral load excreted by animals with quiescent infection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36938/27099,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Molecular Identification of Leptospira interrogans in Naturally Infected Cows from a Rural Property in the Border Region - Case Report,"The aim of this study was to investigate the antibodies and DNA of Leptospira spp. isolated from infected cattle in a small rural dairy farm in a border region between Brazil and Paraguay. Blood and urine samples were collected from 50 Holstein cows aged between 1 and 15 years. The diagnostic tests performed were microscopic serum agglutination for antibody detection and polymerase chain reaction for Leptospira spp. detection. Out of the samples analyzed, 48% were MAT positive with titers ranging from 100 to 400, and the most prevalent antibody was to the serovar Hardjo. One serum sample was amplified to 549 bp for the sec y gene, and sequencing identified it as L. interrogans. This is the first report from northwestern Paraná (PR) State of L. interrogans identification in naturally infected milk cattle. Thus, based on these results, to enhance production efficiency, new serological and molecular studies on dairy cattle from border regions are required to characterize the epidemiology of possible genotypes and their consequences in affected herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37575/27363,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Seabirds: studies with parasitofauna and potential indicator for environmental anthropogenic impacts,"The aim of this review was to present the main anthropogenic threats to seabirds, a taxonomic group described as environmental sentinels, and the dynamics between parasites and hosts and their relationship with the health of the marine ecosystem. Coastal marine environments support various anthropogenic activities, exposing seabirds to multiple and synergistic environmental changes. These activities are considered negative to the maintenance of several seabird species, such as exposure to constant aquatic contaminants and fishing. In addition, parasitic and infectious diseases (viral, bacterial, and fungal) may also play an important role in maintaining some seabird populations. Some pathogenic organisms have public health importance and/or may indicate environmental quality. Host-parasite interaction may be positive, negative, or absent depending on some environmental factors potentially associated with degradation, as well as intrinsic factors of host or parasite. In addition, investigating aspects of seabird mortality also contributes to the constant population monitoring and understanding of the interaction between animals, humans, and the environment. Thus, seabirds and their parasitofauna can provide important ecological and health information, including those related to environmental health, supporting strategies for reducing degradation and maintaining marine ecosystems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37305/27365,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Quality of re-ensiled sorghum silages after prolonged periods of environmental exposure,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of re-ensiling on the fermentability coefficient (FC), chemical composition and fermentation profile of untreated whole-crop sorghum silage after prolonged periods of environmental exposure. Treatments comprised eight times of exposure to the environment (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h) and two procedures for conservation (conventional and re-ensiling) in a completely randomized design with two factors and three replicates. Experimental silos made of 12-L plastic buckets were used in trials. Silage nutritive value, fermentation profile, and dry mass (DM) losses were analyzed before and 90 days after re-ensiling. Regression analyses were performed, and ANOVA was used to compare means. The FC was higher than 45 even when the silage was exposed to air for 120 h before re-ensiling (59.2±2.54). Regression equations were fitted to the data with low accuracy (R2 < 0.47). Moreover, we observed that the main effect occurred between before and after re-ensiling, decreasing the contents of DM (42 to 37 %) and water-soluble carbohydrates (7.0 to 5.8 % DM), neutral detergent fiber (60.4 to 55.4 % DM), and acid detergent fiber (49.5 to 33.5 % DM), but increasing those of lactic acid (0.52 to 0.96 % DM) and ammoniacal nitrogen (1.58 to 2.51 % total N). The DM losses were linear with increasing times of air exposure; however, silage nutritive value and fermentation profile showed no disturbing changes for silage conservation and animal feeding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36346/26459,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Robotic milking of dairy cows: a review,"Automatic milking systems (AMS) have aroused worldwide interest recently. The first installation was by the company Lely in a project in the Netherlands (its homeland) in 1992. But nowadays, AMS represents a growing reality due to lobby for labor issues, rising costs, difficulty finding well-trained workers, and/ or difficulty keeping people on farms. This work aimed to present a review of the literature on AMS, beginning with a brief history of the evolution of the technology, showing advantages and limitations of its use, and ultimately giving some suggestions. The understanding of the technical functioning and operational running can help farmers and technicians in decision making on the adoption of the new technology. Besides workforce reduction and labor quality promotion, AMS has potential to improve feed conversion to milk, milk quality (with lower SCC), and cow productivity, as well as providing useful data and parameters for better farm management. Potential limitations include high investment costs, changes in milk composition (solids, free fatty acids), and increased risk of ketosis in cows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39480/28084,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Anti-Neospora caninum IgG in fetal bovine serum,"Neospora caninum is an obligate intracellular protozoan, recognized as an important cause of abortion in infection cattle worldwide, and is responsible for major economic losses in beef and dairy herds. There are scarce data on the presence of antibodies in fetal serum samples from beef cattle. The pathogen is straggling mainly by vertical transmission in ruminants. This study aimed to determine the frequency of anti-N. caninum antibodies in fetal bovine serum. Overall, 751 fetal serum samples from slaughterhouses in Uruguaiana and Santo Ângelo (Rio Grande do Sul state) were used. Serologic diagnosis was made using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Slides were prepared by culturing infected Vero cells using tachyzoites of the N. caninum NC-1 strain and a serum dilution of 1:25. Of the 751 samples analyzed, 11.7% (88/751) were positive in the IFA assay. The results indicate an occurrence of neosporosis in the studied region, as well as the possibility of transplacental transmission of the protozoon, characterizing an important mechanism of propagation for the disease.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37627/27542,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Clinical determination of the nutritional status of companion animals,"A well-nourished animal is predisposed to good quality of life, health and high longevity. On the other hand, malnourished animals are predisposed to higher morbidity and mortality rates, recurrent hospitalizations, longer hospitalization times, and high health care expenditures. Malnutrition is associated with metabolic alterations and systemic dysfunctions, such as immunosuppression, impaired healing, and loss of weight due to reduced muscle and adipose mass, in addition to worsening skin and coat appearance. Nutritional assessment quantifies not only malnutrition and overweight but also how much these deviations would influence a patient's prognosis. In addition, the identification of malnourished animals allows the performance of specific nutritional treatments, with consequent clinical improvement. There are several techniques to evaluate nutritional status (NS) in dogs and cats; however, because they are individually limited, it is highly recommended to incorporate different methods before completing each case assessment. This literature review gathered information on the techniques of NS assessment during clinical examination, including anamnesis and physical examination. The importance of the manuscript is justified by the lack of nutritional semiology of small animals in the literature. In summary, there are useful markers of NS in companion animals: weight variation, the muscle mass score (MMS) and the body condition score (BCS). Additionally, the BCS, MMS and body mass index (BMI) assist in determining prognosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36366/27543,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Chemical characterization and in vitro antimicrobial activity of honeybee propolis and Scaptotrigona jujuyensis geopropolis against tomato pathogenic bacteria,"The antimicrobial activity of four concentrations of hydroalcoholic extracts from honeybee propolis and Scaptotrigona jujuyensis geopropolis was screened in vitro against five tomato pathogenic bacteria. The agar-well diffusion method was used and the tested bacteria were Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Xanthomonas gardneri, Xanthomonas vesicatoria, Pseudomonas corrugata, and Pseudomonas mediterranea. The main chemical characteristics of propolis and geopropolis, including the polyphenol profile through HPLC-DAD, were also determined. Geopropolis raw sample presented higher values of moisture (7.78%), waxes (50.79%) and ashes (3.69%) than propolis (4.59%, 31.16% and 2.42% respectively). The total polyphenol content and the dry extract were higher in propolis hydroalcoholic extract (3.83 mg eq galic acid mL-1 and 7.87%, respectively) than in the extract of geopropolis (0.16 mg eq galic acid mL-1 and 0.15%, respectively). Chromatographic analysis confirmed the presence of caffeic acid, quercetin, 1,5,7-trihydroxy-flavanone, apigenin, pinobanksin, chrysin, pinocembrin, and galangin in both extracts. The antimicrobial assay showed significant differences between the hydroalcoholic extract activities, as well as between the sensitivity of the tested bacteria. Propolis hydroalcoholic extract dilutions had an inhibitory effect over four of the five tested bacteria, while geopropolis hydroalcoholic extract dilutions were only effective against C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, and to a lesser extent. The sequence of bacteria sensitivity to propolis treatments was: C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis > X. gardneri > X. vesicatoria > P. corrugata. Pseudomonas mediterranea was not sensitive to any of the hydroalcoholic extracts. The antimicrobial activity of both extracts was dose-dependent where the most concentrated treatments were the most effective (15.0 mg mL?1 of geopropolis and 78.7 mg mL?1 of propolis dry extract, respectively). The polyphenol content and the HPLC-DAD profile of the hydroalcoholic extracts disclosed differences in chemical composition that helped to explain the outcomes of the in vitro assay. These results are a contribution to the characterization of bee bioactive products, specifically to propolis and geopropolis. This study indicates the likelihood of using propolis as a non-conventional strategy to control tomato bacterial diseases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38436/27541,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Alternative low-cost precipitation kit for assessing irrigation systems,"Irrigation systems must be assessed periodically to verify equipment quality and the need for adjustments. For this, precipitation test kits are necessary. However, commercially available kits have as their main disadvantage the high cost. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an alternative low-cost precipitation kit and verify its efficiency compared to an available commercial brand. The validation test was carried out at the Laboratory of Hydraulics of the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) using a conventional sprinkler system organized in a quadrangular arrangement. Water collections were carried out within two hours using a grid of plastic collectors spaced at 3 × 3 m and installed at 0.7 m above the ground. The coefficient of determination (R2), uniformity coefficients, application efficiency, and thematic maps of the spatial variability of the applied irrigation depth were compared between kits and used for the validation of measurements. The results showed a high agreement between the developed (GESAI) and a commercial kit (Trademark) (R2 = 0.9849), and a high spatial agreement between the collected water depths. Therefore, the GESAI kit is a low-cost alternative for the assessment of irrigation systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37615/27540,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Control agents on the quality of Africanized honeybee queens,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, used in large field crops, and of the pomegranate Punica granatum aqueous extract, with insecticidal potential for insect control, on the quality of Africanized Apis mellifera queens. The control sample was composed of sterile distilled water with Tween®. The treatments were incorporated into a voile fabric, covered with an acrylic plate and packed with queen rearing nucleus hive, so the worker bees could be in contact with control agents (B. bassiana and P. granatum). In the next day, frames with 30 cell cups for queen rearing with larvae were introduced to produce queens, which were monitored at moment of emergency. Measurements included live weight, wing size, abdomen size, thorax size, the time of emergence, and analysis of the breeding area size. Histological analyses of the hypopharyngeal glands of attendant worker bees and of the midgut of virgin queens were performed. There was no reduction in the weight of queens, no changes in the length, width, and height of their thoraxes, no changes in the width and length of the wing, and no changes in total length. However, B. bassiana increased the weight of the queens and reduced emergency time. The control agents did not interfere in villi height and breeding area. No differences were found in tissues when the treatments were compared with their control. P. granatum extract and the fungus B. bassiana did not interfere in the quality of Africanized A. mellifera queens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36051/27539,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Crude glycerin inclusion in Santa Inês ewes’ diet before and during the breeding season: its effects on physiological parameters, hematological variables, and reproductive performance","In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of concentrate supplementation containing crude glycerin (CG) before and during the breeding season on the physiological and blood biochemical variables as well as on the reproductive performance of Santa Inês ewes. A total of 24 ewes (12 pluriparous and 12 nulliparous ewes, 4 and 1.5 years old, weighing an average of 40 ± 5 and 27 ± 3 kg, respectively) were randomly assigned to three treatments consisting of different dietary concentrations of CG (0%, 5%, and 10 % of the total dry matter). The experiment lasted 63 days and was divided into three 21-day phases. In the first and second phases, the animals were subjected to flushing. In the second and third phases, we evaluated the animals’ reproductive performance. Weather, physiological, and blood biochemical variables were also studied. The results indicated that the inclusion of CG did not influence significantly (P > 0.05) either the ewes’ body weight or their body condition score. All ewes exhibited estrus during the breeding season. Their respiratory rate was significantly influenced by the time of day (P < 0.0001). A 10% CG supplementation did not drastically change the hematological and biochemical variables, which were within the reference ranges. However, the week of supplementation influenced serum metabolites (P < 0.05). Thus, these results indicate that CG could be used in up to 10% in replacement of ground corn without significantly affecting the physiological, hematological, and biochemical parameters of the ewes or their reproductive performance before and during the breeding season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38598/27538,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Campo Grande stylo and elephant grass mixed silages treated with microbial inoculant,"Tropical grass has some advantages for ensilage, such as high annual production of dry matter per unit area, perennity, low loss risk, and higher harvest flexibility. We aimed with this study to assess the chemical composition, microbial population, fermentation characteristics, and effluent production of stylo (Stylosanthes capitata × S. macrocephala cv. Campo Grande) silages with increasing proportions (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Cameroon), with or without microbial inoculant. We used a 5×2 factorial scheme in a completely randomized design, with three replicates. There was an effect of interaction between proportions of elephant grass and microbial inoculant on yeast population, butyric acid and ammonia-nitrogen content, and effluent loss. The proportions of elephant grass affected the chemical composition, lactic acid bacteria and mold populations, pH, and lactic and propionic acid contents. Dry matter, acid detergent insoluble nitrogen, and lactic acid contents and the pH values were negatively affected by microbial inoculant. We conclude that stylo provides silage with better chemical composition and lower effluent production, although with a higher mold and yeast population, than elephant grass. The microbial inoculant does not improve the chemical and fermentative characteristics of silages, except for the reduction of butyric acid. We recommend uninoculated stylo silage with up to 75% of elephant grass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37637/27536,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Consumption, apparent digestibility and nutrient balance of diets with bovine milk whey for goats","Increasing milk production in countries such as Brazil, India and Pakistan implies the generation of dairy by-products such as nutrient-rich bovine whey which, if used in feeding small ruminants would reduce environmental waste and add value to this by-product. Twenty entire male kids weighing an average 17 kg and 5 months age were used. The diet control was composed by Aruana hay, milled whole maize, pelleted soybean and limestone. Bovine cheese whey at 1.5; 3.0 and 4.5% (DM basis) was added to experimental diets. Variables measured included intake, nutrient apparent digestibility, energy balance, and nitrogen balance. Regression equations and Pearson correlations (P ? 0.05) were determined. The 3% diet resulted in greater ether extract (EE) (g/kg0.75) and digestible EE (P ? 0.05) concentrations compared to 0% whey. The consumption of cellulose (g/kg0.75) was greater (P ? 0.05) for kids on the 3.0% diet compared to 0 or 1.5%. Nutrient apparent digestibility was not affected (P > 0.05) by the inclusion of whey. Kids on the 4.5% diet excreted more (P ? 0.05) fecal N than those fed no whey; these also retained less N (P ? 0.05) compared to animals fed 3.0% or less whey in their diet. All diets resulted in positive energy and nitrogen balances. Bovine whey can be included in male kid diets up to 4.5% of diet without negatively affecting consumption or apparent digestibility of those diets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37570/27535,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Genetic characterization of selected Nile tilapia in Santa Catarina,"Different Nile tilapia stocks belonging to the fish breeding program of the Epagri (Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina) were characterized by microsatellite markers. A total of nine stocks (S1 to S9) were evaluated, and for each stock the caudal fin of 30 individuals were sampled. A total of 75 alleles were found at the 11 microsatellite loci used (UNH104, UNH108, UNH160, UNH208, UNH222, UNH848, UNH879, UNH898, UNH952, UNH998). Among the loci used, only UHN160 showed significance for null alleles in stocks S1, S2, S3 and S5. The average number of alleles per loci was 6.8, while the average number of alleles per tilapia stock was 4.4. Five unique alleles were identified between the stock S1 and S5. The observed heterozygosity values (Ho) exceeded the expected heterozygosity (He), resulting in a negative inbreeding coefficient (FIS = -0.092). FST for the total population was 0.109, demonstrating moderate genetic differentiation between the stocks. According to the Euclidean distance, three groups were formed as follows: I - S6, S7 and S9; II - S2, S3 and S4; and III - S1, S5 and S8. However, the existence of two groups can be observed from the PCoA representation: I - S6, S7, S8 and S9; and II - S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5. The formation of these two genetic groups is consistent with the genealogy of stocks. The formation of group III (S1, S5 and S8) in the dendrogram can be explained by the higher average observed heterozygosity values of these stocks. Bayesian analysis revealed the formation of 16 groups with an FST value of 0.2107. This result reinforces the existence of variability existing in the Epagri breeding program, from which it is possible to form heterotic groups to enable the direction of potential crosses to obtain genetic gain. The study enabled genotypic characterization of the tilapia brood stock used in the Epagri breeding program, determining the genetic distance between the stocks, which will enable more accurate selection of individuals for mating for the next generation. It was possible to verify that there is high heterozygosity within the stocks, and moderate genetic differentiation between the stocks. Furthermore, all evaluated markers were polymorphic for this brood stock and will be used to characterize the next generations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38045/27537,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Losses, chemical composition and aerobic stability of rye silage cv. Temprano subjected to different pre-flowering cuttings with or without fungicide","The present study evaluated the fermentation, chemical characteristics and ruminal disappearance of dry matter of silages of rye cv. Temprano harvested at the stage of floury grain, managed with or without cutting at the vegetative stage and with or without application of Fluxapyroxad + Pyraclostrobin-based fungicide at the pre-flowering phenological stage. This was a 2x2 factorial randomized block experimental design, with 2 cutting regimes (0 and 1 cut) and 2 application management (with and without fungicide), with six replications, where each repetition is represented by a plot of 9.45m², with the treatments SC-SF: without cut at the vegetative stage and without fungicide application; SC-CF: without cut at the vegetative stage with fungicide application; UC-SF: a cut at the vegetative stage with pre-flowering fungicide application; UC-CF: a cut at the vegetative stage and without fungicide application. UC-CF silages were better in the general context, due to the better fiber composition with an average 6.75% reduction in neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber and a 17.10% reduction in lignin content, but, due to its higher DM content, it presented a less efficient fermentation process in terms of organic acid concentration and aerobic stability. However, it did not change the DM losses or ruminal degradability, and there is also the use of DM harvested at the vegetative stage that certainly has a superior quality. The use of fungicide provided only better dry matter index and better fiber composition and improved the fermentation process resulting in lower DM losses without altering the aerobic stability of silages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37372/27534,E-ISSN 1679-0359

41,2020,Season effects on the composition of milk produced by a Holstein herd managed under semi-confinement followed by compost bedded dairy barn management,"Here, we studied the composition of milk produced by a Holstein herd in the municipality of Nova Boa Vista, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. The herd was first managed under a semi-confinement system and subsequently, in a compost bedded dairy barn system to facilitate animal management and, more importantly, family work. We monitored milk production by the herd under a semi-confinement system from January 2013 through September 2015, and then under a compost bedded dairy barn system from October 2015 through December 2017. The seasons of the year were spring (October to December), summer (January to March), autumn (April to June), and winter (July to September). Our results showed an increase in somatic cell count and total bacterial count with the change from semi-confinement to the compost bedded dairy barn system, possibly due to management factors; however, no changes were observed for any other of the variables under study, including lactose, fat, protein, and total solids. In addition, season markedly influenced milk composition and quality; thus, in winter and spring, milk was of a higher quality, whereas in the hotter months of summer and autumn fodder quality and availability, and the incidence of mastitis, as reflected by somatic cell count, affected milk quality negatively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37243/27531,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Chemical parameters and ruminal disappearance of Secale cereale rye forage in different harvest systems with or without fungicide,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the chemical parameters and the ruminal disappearance of dry matter of forage from the rye Secale cereale, cv. Temprano managed in different harvest regimes at the vegetative stage, with or without application of a fungicide based on Fluxapyroxade + Piraclostrobin at the pre-flowering stage. This was a randomized block experimental design and the treatments consisted of evaluating the forage harvested at floury grain stage, as follow, SCSF: no cut at the vegetative stage, no application of fungicide; SCCF: no cut at the vegetative stage with fungicide application; UCSF: one cut at the vegetative stage, no application of fungicide; UCCF: one cut with fungicide application; DCSF: two cuts at the vegetative stage, no fungicide application; DCCF: two cuts with fungicide application. In general, one cut at the vegetative stage and a subsequent cut for ensiling at floury grain stage was the best system used in cv. Temprano, based on the chemical parameters and ruminal disappearance. This system provided a better composition of fiber carbohydrates with lower contents of Acid Detergent Fiber (41.55%) and Lignin (10.79%) after cutting and resulted in a better disappearance rate of dry matter at the rumen level (0.46 %) per hour of exposure, highlighting the cut at the vegetative stage that produced a material with 20.76% Crude Protein and 52.69% Neutral Detergent showing its nutritional quality for use in grazing land or as haylage. The application of fungicide provided significant improvements in the contents of crude protein (8.24% vs 7.23%) and mineral matter (3.02% vs 2.82%) of the plant at the time of ensiling, which generated better dry matter disappearance rates in the rumen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37368/27591,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Different roughage to concentrate ratios in extruded ration and metabolic parameters of growing lambs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the dry matter intake and metabolic parameters of 30 lambs fed with extruded ration with different roughage to concentrate ratios. It was carried out at the Federal University of Uberlândia from 7 December 2016 to 22 March 2017. The treatments were extruded rations, at 30% roughage and 70% concentrate (30R:70C) and 70% roughage and 30% concentrate (70R:30C) ratios, distributed completely randomly with two treatments and 15 animals per treatment. The treatment means were evaluated by the Tukey test and a regression study with a significance level of 5%. The dry matter intake (DMI) was evaluated. Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture to determine the concentration of energy-related, protein and mineral metabolites as well as enzymes indicative of hepatic and muscular activity. There was lower DMI for the 30R:70C treatment, as well as reduction in DMI in relation to body weight at the end of the experiment. The treatments influenced urea: animals with higher urea concentrations consumed the ration with higher concentrate content. Further, animals fed with more roughage had a higher concentration of phosphorus. In conclusion, the roughage to concentrate ratio of the extruded ration influenced the dry matter intake without triggering metabolic disorders in the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37231/27530,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Evaluation of minimum ripening time of artisanal mountain cheese from Santa Catarina prior to selling,"Artisanal mountain cheese (queijo artesanal serrano; AMS) is produced from raw milk, which makes it a suitable medium for the multiplication of pathogenic microorganisms. The ripening process involves physical, chemical and microbiological factors unfavorable to pathogen development. For this reason, the Brazilian legislation requires a minimum ripening time of 60 days. However, according to Normative Instruction (NI) no 30, of August 7, 2013, and Decree no. 9.013, of March 29, 2017, this time can be reduced provided that scientific studies show that there is no alteration in the safety of the product. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological quality of AMS in 19 cheese factories in the Serra Catarinense region, at 14, 21, 28 and 35 days of ripening, and to determine which period would meet the microbiological limits. A total of 76 samples of AMS, 19 samples of water and 19 samples of raw milk were studied. The microorganisms were investigated following Ordinance no. 146, of March 7, 1996. The investigation and count of coliforms at 30 °C, E. coli and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus followed protocols by Silva et al. (2010), using Petrifilm™. The investigation of Salmonella spp. followed Silva et al. (2010), whereas the investigation of Listeria monocytogenese and count of mesophilic aerobes followed NI no. 30, of June 26, 2018. Water potability was evaluated by the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique, in accordance with NI no. 30/2018 and Consolidation Ordinance no. 5, of September 28, 2017. Results were tested by Analysis of Variance and Linear Regression using the SAS statistical package with significance determined at p < 0.05. No safe ripening period for sale could be determined. At 35 days of ripening, 14 farms still showed counts above the limit for the microorganisms described in the legislation. On one of the farms, the presence of L. monocytogenes was detected in the four evaluated periods, demonstrating that ripening was not efficient to eliminate the pathogen. The microbiological quality of the milk was not satisfactory, with 63.16% of the samples not conforming to the standards. As regards the potability of the water used in the cheese factories, 52.63% of the analyzed samples showed unsatisfactory results. The research revealed heterogeneity in the hygienic-sanitary standards adopted by the cheese factories, indicating that there is a need for training in Good Agricultural Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices, support from institutions, periodic inspection and commitment of producers to standardize the process.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36839/27527,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Can cover sheath model influence semen retention in AI-gun trials and pregnancy rates of cows inseminated at a fixed-time?,"The achievement of satisfactory results in fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols depends on several factors, such as the quality of the materials used to perform the artificial insemination (AI). In this context, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the cover sheath model on the residual retention of semen during AI and the pregnancy rates of cows submitted to FTAI. In Experiment 1, 400 straws of cryopreserved bovine semen were thawed and repacked in samples with similar weight and volume characteristics. Each new dose of semen (n = 300) was mounted using one of three AI cover sheath models (n = 100 semen/sheath doses): the main brand in the global market (G1), the main model in the Brazilian market (G2), and a model marketed as having a low residual semen retention rate (G3), to determine the percentages of seminal elimination (PSEs) during AI. In Experiment 2, 464 Nelore cows were synchronized through intravaginal progesterone implants and inseminated using the same cover sheaths as those tested in Experiment 1, which were grouped into classes (conventional: G1 and G2 [n = 225]; and low reflux: G3 [n = 239]). In Experiment 3, 859 Nelore cows were synchronized and inseminated as described above, using the same cover sheaths previously tested. After each AI, cover sheaths were visually inspected for the presence of residual semen and pregnancy diagnosis was performed 35 days after FTAI (Experiments 2 and 3). The PSEs in Experiment 1 were 91.7%, 90.6% and 96.5% for groups G1, G2 and G3, respectively (P = 0.05). The pregnancy rates in Experiment 2 were 53.33% and 58.16% for the conventional and low reflux model, respectively (P > 0.05), but there were differences (P = 0.05) among the cover sheath models employed for AI (G1 - 57.72% [71/123]; G2 - 48.04% [49/102]; G3 - 58.16% [139/239]). Additionally, a lower semen reflux incidence (P < 0.05) was observed in the low residual sperm retention model (0.72%) in Experiment 3, compared to the main international (10.42%) and national (22.99%) market models. In conclusion, residual semen retention occurs regardless of the cover sheath model used for AI. However, the PSE is influenced by the model and quality of cover sheath used. According to the results, the cover sheath represents a factor that may compromise the pregnancy rates of synchronized cows for FTAI.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36831/27526,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Intake, performance, carcass traits and meat quality of goats grazing in the Caatinga rangeland","The objective of this study was to evaluate the intake, performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of goats submitted to grazing in the Caatinga rangeland supplemented with two hays: jitirana (Merremia aegyptia) or mororó (Bauhinia cheilanta), with or without the association of spineless cactus (Nopalea cochelinifera Salm Dick), and a treatment without supplementation (control). Thirty male goats (castrated), of no defined breed, with an initial mean body weight of 19 ± 0.35 kg and approximately 90 days of age were used. The experimental design was completely randomized, using initial body weight as a covariate, in a factorial design (2 x 2) + 1, with five treatments and six replicates. The highest intake of supplement, total dry matter (DM), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC), and total digestible nutrients (TDN) intakes occurred in the animals supplemented with jitirana or mororó hays associated with spineless cactus, and higher crude protein (CP) intake accounted for goats supplemented with mororó hay and spineless cactus. Higher intakes of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were observed in the animals fed with jitirana hay. There were no dietary influences in pasture DM intake, performance, cut weights, and carcass characteristics. As for the quality of the meat, there was an influence of the treatments only on the parameter b* (yellowness). Feeding supplementation with jitirana and mororó hays, and spineless cactus did not improve performance and carcass characteristics, and did not negatively influence the quality of goat meat raised on pasture in the Caatinga region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37038/27529,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Characterization of enteropathy in mice infected with Giardia duodenalis and treated with differing anti-parasite drugs,"Our aim was to analyze the duodena of mice infected with Giardia duodenalis (assemblage A) after four different types of parasite treatment for enteropathy. Methods: Forty-eight male Swiss mice, 21 days of age, received 1000 parasite cysts orally. The animals were divided into six groups: negative (G1) and positive control (G2), and groups treated with nitazoxanide (G3), albendazole (G4), metronidazole (G5), and secnidazole (G6). After treatment they were sacrificed and the duodena were examined histopathologically. Results: In the positive control group G2, increased levels of neutral and acidic goblet cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and Paneth cells were found. There was a reduction in villus height and an increase in villus width; and crypts presented increased widths and depths.

Conclusions: Metronidazole was the most effective in attenuating the enteropathy caused by G. duodenalis infection; reversing the increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and Paneth cells, and attenuating the other elements investigated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36925/27528,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii: seroprevalence and associated factors in cows from milk farms of Toledo, Parana, Brazil","Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii are important protozoa in cattle production. Neosporosis is responsible for reproductive failures in cattle, constituting one of the main causes of abortion and leading to significant economic losses in dairy farming. Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan disease of great importance in the context of public health and animal production. Considering the lack of available data on the subject for the studied region, the objective of the present study was to detect the seroprevalence of antibodies against N. caninum and T. gondii in dairy cows in the municipality of Toledo, Western Paraná, Brazil and to assess how to detect factors associated with risk or protection. Serology was performed with serum samples from 390 dairy cows from 58 farms by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) reaction using cutoff point 100 for N. caninum and 64 for T. gondii. The analysis of associations between seropositivity and the variables detected in the properties was also performed. The seroprevalence for Neospora caninum was 15.4% (60/390; CI 95% 12.4-19.3) and for Toxoplasma gondii was 38.7% (151/390; CI 95% 34.0-43.6). The prevalence of co-infection was 8.72% (34/390; CI 95% 6.31-11.94). For N. caninum, the presence of abortion was observed as a risk factor (OR= 5.32). With T. gondii, the presence of abortion was found to be a risk factor (OR= 2.09) and properties with 10 or more lactating animals was found to be a protection factor (OR= 0.56). Abortion was also detected as a factor associated with the risk of co-infection (OR= 11.80). Through serological diagnosis, the present study showed that protozoa are widely distributed among dairy cattle in the region, and control and prophylaxis measures should be adopted in the studied animal population. Because abortion is a risk associated with N. caninum, T. gondii, and the two agents surveyed (co-infection), all reproductive disorders detected in cattle should include neosporosis and toxoplasmosis as a differential diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36460/27524,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Effects of lidocaine associated with detomidine on sedation of horses undergoing dental procedures,"Due to the growing increase in the dental routine in equine medicine, along with the need for patient sedation to perform this procedure, this study aimed to assess sedation by detomidine alone and/or associated with lidocaine under continuous infusion. Twenty-two horses from the dental routine of the veterinary hospital of the institution of origin were used. A jugular catheter was implanted on the day of study and animals were allocated into two distinct groups (n=11): GD, which received detomidine (20 µg kg?1), followed by continuous infusion (20 µg kg?1 h?1); and GDL, animals which received detomidine (10 µg kg?1) and lidocaine (1.3 mg kg?1), followed by continuous infusion of detomidine (10 µg kg?1 h?1) and lidocaine (25 µg kg?1 min?1). The assessed moments were as follows: M0, before catheter placement; M1, 5 minutes after bolus and beginning of infusion; M2, placement of mouth speculum; and M3, wear with an electric rasp. The assessed parameters were heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (f), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and intestinal motility. In addition to the clinical parameters, sedation was assessed by measuring head height in relation to the ground before (M0) and after treatment administration (M1) and during the dental procedure using a scale adapted for dental procedures. Statistical analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test by applying one-way RM ANOVA, followed by the Dunnett test for comparison in relation to M0, t-test, and Mann-Whitney test between groups (p ? 0.05). HR decreased by 20% at M2 and M3 compared to M0 only in GD, while SBP increased 35% at the same moments compared to M0 in GD and 27, 42, and 27% at M1, M2, and M3 compared to M0 in GDL, respectively. Intestinal motility decreased by 75% at all moments compared to M0 in both groups. Head height decreased by 67% in GD and 60% in GDL, with no difference between groups. Sedation scores provided by the scale did not differ between groups, with values of 1 [0–3] in GD and 3 [0–4] in GDL at M2 and 1 [0–3] in GD and 1 [1.5–3] in GDL at M3. Thus, sedation by the association between detomidine and lidocaine allowed reducing detomidine dose in half but offering similar results for dental procedures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36656/27525,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Isoquinolone alkaloids mitigate microscopic digestive tract lesions induced by sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in feedlot cattle,"Feedlot cattle is submitted to a diet rich in energy and reduced in fibres that induces the sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) with its lesions and clinical signs. Recent studies have demonstrated some amelioration of this condition by the use of isoquinolone alkaloids found in Macleaya cordata (Papaveraceae) such as Sanguinarine and Chelerythrine. These compounds have demonstrated antimicrobial, anti-in?ammatory and immune-modulatory effects in both humans and animals The aim on this study, using histopathology and a score system, was to evaluate the differences between a non-treated and a treated group feed with these alkaloids, present in trade preparation Sangrovit-RS® as a source of sanguinarine (SG), chelerythrine (CH) and protropine (PA) standardized to 0.15% w/w SG, using feedlot cattle under a high-grain diet as an inflammatory model for gastrointestinal system. The samples of forestomachs were evaluated and graded using scores ranging from zero (0) to three (3) obtained at light-microscopic fields of 400X. Parameters such as inflammation, hydropic degeneration, hyperkeratosis, and vesicle formation were accessed in the different layers of the tissues, considering the severity and dispersion of the microscopic lesions. The soft tissues such as the abomasum, small intestine, cecum and colon had their total amount of inflammatory cells counted at light-microscopic fields of 200X. The rumen of the SG-CH-PRO-treated group showed a significant reduction in the epithelial hydropic degeneration scores (p ? 0.001) and lamina propria inflammation (p ? 0.001).The reticulum had a similar reduction in scores of epithelial (p ? 0.002) and stratum corneum hydropic degeneration (p ? 0.001), hyperkeratosis (p ? 0.002) and inflammation in lamina propria (p ? 0.001) and epithelium (p ? 0.002). The omasum had no significant differences. All non-keratinized tissues, except for ileum, had a significant decrease (p ? 0.001) in the total counting of inflammatory cells. In this trial, the feedlot cattle feed with high grain diet and treated with isoquinolone alkaloids expressed lesions that indicate ameliorations and worsening’s. Ameliorating effects of the alkaloids were better demonstrated in tissues with reduced or no corneal layer in the mucosa and in the absence of a lipopolysaccharides rich acidic environment reinforcing the notion of the topic action, the dependence of the media pH and the time of exposure modulating the pharmacological mechanisms of these alkaloids. The observed cytolytic (oncolysis) effect in epithelial forestomachs cells under low pH values, worsening the osmotic status, should be considered before clinical applications.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36073/27938,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Projective mapping: potential tool for sensory evaluation of coffees for industrial application,"Sensory analysis is an important tool to control and improve the quality of food products. This study aimed to evaluate the sensory attributes and consumer preference of coffee beverages prepared from roasted ground coffee (Coffea arabica) of different brands sold in Minas Gerais, Brazil, using projective mapping and assess the relationship of sensory attributes and consumer preferences with physicochemical properties. Titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids, color, crude fat, protein, total phenolic content, caffeine, trigonelline, 5-caffeoylquinic acid and caffeic acid were determined. Physicochemical properties showed good agreement with projective mapping data. Samples associated with high acidity in the projective mapping task had the highest levels of 5-caffeoylquinic acid. Coffees associated with bitter/roasted taste and darker colors had typical physicochemical characteristics and color properties of dark-roasted coffee. The sample perceived as thin had the lowest soluble solids content. Consumers preferred traditional, dark-roasted coffee over gourmet, light-roasted coffee. Projective mapping is an effective technique for assessing the sensory attributes of brewed coffee.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37438/27521,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Rice bran as a substitute for soy protein and erythorbate in chicken nuggets,"Rice bran is a byproduct with high biological value protein, fiber and phytic acid content. The nutritional and technological properties of rice bran have been highlighted and are attractive for food application. This research aimed at replacing soy protein (SP) and sodium erythorbate (SE) by defatted rice bran (DRB) in chicken nuggets. Three formulations were prepared: T1 with SP and SE; T2 with SP and without SE; and T3 with total SP and SE replacement by DRB. Lipid stability was evaluated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) on storage days 0, 30, and 60 (-18 °C). Physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were also evaluated. Color, aroma, flavor, texture acceptance, and overall impression was evaluated using a 9-point hedonic scale for 60 days of storage. T3 presented lipid stability comparable to T1 in all intervals evaluated reinforcing the antioxidant potential of DRB. However, T2 showed the lowest lipid stability due to the absence of antioxidants, presenting rancid aroma and flavor not allowing for its sensorial evaluation. Physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were either not influenced or positively influenced by DRB addition. For all attributes, T3 and T1 presented similar acceptance sensory means, with > 72.4% acceptability index. DRB is a rice byproduct potentially suitable for its use by the meat industry.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37211/27520,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Effects of irrigation water salinity and salicylic acid on germination and vigor of Mesosphaerum suaveolens (L.) Kuntze,"Salinity is one of the factors that negatively impact plant growth and productivity; therefore, it is necessary to seek solutions that help mitigate the degenerative action of saline stress on crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of salicylic acid (SA) on the germination and vigor of Mesosphaerum suaveolens (L.) Kuntze seeds subjected to salinity. The experiment was carried out using a completely randomized design, in an incomplete 5 × 5 factorial scheme, with five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw - 0.0, 1.45, 5.00, 8.55, and 10.00 dS m-1) and five doses of SA (0.0, 0.29, 1.00, 1.71, and 2.00 mM), with four replications of 50 seeds, totaling nine combinations generated via a central composite design. The germination percentage, first germination count, germination speed index, average germination time, percentage of abnormal seedlings, shoot, root, and seedling lengths, and total seedling dry mass were evaluated. Salicylic acid attenuated the effect of saline stress on initial growth, mitigating damage to root and shoot lengths. Seed priming with salicylic acid improved germination and seed vigor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36355/27517,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Leaf orientation of maize plants as influenced by seed positioning in the soil,"Adequate positioning of the seed in the planting furrow allows the maize leaves to be oriented perpendicularly in relation to the sowing row, minimizing overlap and self-shading. The aim of this study was to investigate the positioning of flat and round maize seeds in the furrow and its effects on leaf orientation and plant architecture in the horizontal plane. The experiment was conducted in pots in a greenhouse, using 20C-sieve (flat) and 22R-sieve (round) seeds of the Balu 280 PRO hybrid, at a sowing depth of 0.04 m. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with a 5 × 2 factorial arrangement [five seed positions and two shapes (flat and round)] with eight replicates, totaling 80 plots. Leaf orientation was evaluated at the V3 stage. Seed size and shape did not show a significant interaction with seed positioning, suggesting that maize leaf orientation was only influenced by seed positioning. The treatments involving seeds laid in a vertical position pointing toward the bottom of the pot and horizontally with the face that contains only the endosperm (dorsal face) down are the most favorable, regardless of seed shape.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36910/27590,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Mapping of corn phenological stages using NDVI from OLI and MODIS sensors,"Crop phenology knowledge is relevant to a series of actions related to its management and can be accessed through vegetation indexes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from images of OLI and MODIS sensors, to obtain phenological information from corn crops. To this end, we evaluated two corn cropping areas, irrigated by a central pivot, and located western Bahia state, Brazil. These areas were managed with high technology and had no record of biotic and abiotic stresses. NDVI showed a well-defined temporal pattern throughout the corn cycle, with a rapid increase at the beginning, stabilization at intermediate stages, and decreases at the end of the cycle. Excellent fits for polynomial equations were obtained to estimate NDVI as a function of days after sowing (DAS), with R² values of 0.96 and 0.95 for images of OLI and MODIS sensors, respectively. This demonstrates that both sensors could characterize corn canopy changes over time. NDVI ranges were correlated with the main phenological stages (PE), using the direct relationship between both variables (NDVI and PE) with days after sowing (DAS). For the beginning and end of each phenological stage, NDVI ranges were validated through model identity testing. NDVI proved to be a suitable parameter to assess corn phenology accurately and remotely. Finally, NDVI was also an important tool for detecting biotic and abiotic stresses throughout the crop cycle, and hence for decision making based on corn phenology.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36641/27518,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Irrigation frequency and vermiculite proportion in substrate for Eucalyptus grandis seedling,"This study aimed to determine the best irrigation frequency and vermiculite proportion in substrate for Eucalyptus grandis seedling production in poorly technified nurseries. The experiment was carried out in Chapadão do Sul - MS (Brazil) from April 8 to July 23, 2013 (106 days). The experimental design was in randomized blocks arranged in a split-plots, with four irrigation frequencies (plots) and five vermiculite proportions (subplots) and six replications. Irrigation depth was estimated by the reference evapotranspiration (Penman-Monteith) multiplied by a crop coefficient (Kc) of 2. Average daily irrigation depth was 5.5 mm during the experimental period. The results showed that two daily irrigations (at 11:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.) and filling tubes with 80% vermiculite and 20% soil were most suitable for eucalyptus seedling production under these experimental conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36348/30350,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Productivity, mineral composition, and phenolic compound content in bush snap beans grown during different seasons","The sowing of seeds during different seasons, characterized by distinct environmental conditions, can result in different agronomic characteristics and production rates of agricultural crops. Considering the lack of information on the effect of climatic variations on the agronomic performance of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), it is important to evaluate the productivity and nutrient content when sown at different times of the year. Thus, the study aimed to evaluated plant productivity, and seed mineral and phenolic compound composition in different genotypes and cultivars of bush snap bean UEL 1, UEL 2, Isla Macarrão Baixo, Isla Manteiga Baixo, and Feltrin Macarrão Napoli sowed in the spring and autumn. The number of pods per plant, seeds per pod, seeds per plant, and seed yield were evaluated. Chemical composition of the seeds was determined by measuring the amounts of crude protein, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, zinc, manganese, and total phenolic compounds present. The joint analysis of variance of the experiments was performed, with means compared by the Tukey test, at 5%. The interaction between genotype and sowing season affects the number of seeds per plant, seed productivity, and the seed concentrations of crude protein, zinc, and manganese. Spring sowing favored seed yield in the Isla Manteiga Baixo cultivar, the number of pods per plant, and the accumulation of phosphorus and iron in the seeds. Autumn sowing resulted in an increase in the seed-concentrations of potassium and total phenolic compounds. Seed-concentrations of calcium and manganese varied by genotype.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35981/27514,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Quality of reading among equipment for determining water content in corn kernels,"Corn productivity in Brazil has been gradually increasing, and adequate storage of produce is a matter of safety; under appropriate storage, the quality of the product is preserved and losses are avoided or minimized. Hence, monitoring temperature and moisture control is essential. The objective of this study was to verify the quality of readings of equipment used to determine the water content of corn seeds according to the sowing times, and to verify the existence of correlations among the equipment. The experiment was conducted at the Research and Extension Teaching Farm (FEPE), which belongs to UNESP/FCAV in Jaboticabal, SP. The experimental design was based on the basic premise of statistical quality control (SQC). Three experimental areas were evaluated with two corn hybrids and with different days after sowing (DAS): Area A (hybrid AS1633PRO2 at 132 DAS), Area B (hybrid AS1555RR2 at 125 DAS), and Area C (hybrid AS1633PRO2 at 150 DAS). To evaluate the water content of the seeds, an expeditious method was employed using two different moisture sensors (Equipment 1 and 2) based on the principle of dielectric measurement (moisture by capacitance). The greenhouse method (Equipment 3) was also tested. The highest reading quality was observed in Equipment 1, and Area C showed less variability and a higher average yield because of the adequate physiological maturation points of the harvest and more appropriate grain water content. Equipment 3 and 1 showed better correlation between the evaluations because the calibration of Equipment 1 had readings close to those of the standard method (Equipment 3).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33932/27513,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Spatial arrangements of corn grown in Brazilian savanna conditions,"The suitability of the spatial arrangement of corn is a tool capable of promoting better use of the agricultural environment, allowing the crop to express its yield potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic performance of the AG 7098 VT PRO2 corn hybrid, in the municipality of Rio Verde - GO, cultivated in different spatial arrangements of plants and sowing times. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with five replications, in a 4 x 2 factorial scheme, using four plant populations (45, 60, 75, and 90 thousand plants ha-1) and two interrow spacings (0.25 and 0.5 m), and two sowing times (January 26 and February 15, 2017). Morphological characteristics, yield components, and grain yield were evaluated, since data from each sowing season were analyzed separately. In the first period, the population increase in up to 85 thousand plants ha-1 resulted in an increase of grain yield, since there was no effect of reducing the spacing between rows on the evaluated characteristics. The corn sown in the second period, spaced 0.25 m between rows, provided an increase in grain yield, demonstrating that the density of plants may be a promising alternative when the climatic conditions are less favorable to the development of the crop in the Brazilian savanna region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36067/27515,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Efficacy of three methods used to control staphylococcal mastitis in dairy goats,"Goat and sheep farming in Brazil relies on an expressive herd, especially in the Northeast region of the country, where small ruminants constitute a relevant economic activity, with milk production being an important source of income in some dry areas of the Northeastern states. However, there are still some sanitary problems in the management of dairy goats, among which mastitis is highlighted, especially that of the subclinical type. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of antibiotics, exclusively or in combination with vaccines, in the control of sub-clinical mastitis in small ruminants. The study was conducted on a rural property located in Santa Maria da Boa Vista-PE. Fifty-three female Saanen dairy goats were allocated into four experimental groups. An antibiotic therapy with a commercial antimicrobial based on cloxacillin was used in group 1. Group 2 received the commercial vaccine indicated for herds with an incidence of Staphylococcus strains and the same antibiotic described for Group 1. Group 3 was evaluated for the exclusive use of vaccination, and Group 4 was the control group. A microbiological examination of the milk was carried out to confirm cases of mastitis. The percentage of udders, infected by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS) before and after the antibiotic + vaccine treatment was 42.8 and 7.1%, respectively. It was observed that the cloxacillin-based antibiotic could be used alone or in combination with mastitis vaccines to control staphylococcal mastitis in small ruminants. Vaccination alone was not effective in reducing the number of mastitis cases; therefore, a cross reaction against CNS was not observed. Thus, further studies to determine the potential of vaccines to control sub-clinical mastitis in small ruminants are necessary.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38597/28083,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Characterization of associative diazotrophic bacteria in torch ginger,"Associative diazotrophic bacteria perform several processes that promote increased plant development and production, allowing a reduction in the use of agricultural inputs and costs. However, for some species, such as torch ginger, there are still no reports of studies aimed at identifying diazotrophic bacteria associated with this species. On this basis, this study proposes to isolate and characterize associative diazotrophic bacteria in rhizospheric soils and roots of torch ginger as well as analyze the potential of these isolates in solubilizing phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and producing indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Soil and roots samples of torch ginger were inoculated into five different semi-solid and semi-selective culture media, namely, NFb, JNFb, LGI, JMV and FAM, where bacterial growth was diagnosed by the formation of a characteristic film on the surface of the media. Subsequently, the bacterial isolates were analyzed for their ability to solubilize P and K in liquid medium, using phosphate rock powder (AO-15) and potassium rock powder (phonolite) as sources of P and K, respectively. All culture media showed bacterial growth, making this the first report of isolation of diazotrophic bacterial strains in this species. Eight of the obtained strains originated from rhizospheric soils and four from roots of torch ginger. Of these, 10 solubilized P, with the UNIFENAS 100-340, UNIFENAS 100-342 and UNIFENAS 100-348 strains standing out. Six strains showed K solubilizing ability, UNIFENAS 100-346 being the most efficient. All strains were able to produce the IAA phytohormone, both in the presence and absence of tryptophan, with superior results obtained by UNIFENAS 100-344 and UNIFENAS 100-351.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37831/28082,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Identification of sorghum hybrids for silage production in the semiarid (BSh) region of northeastern Brazil,"The objective of this study was to identify the hybrids of sorghum most suitable for the production of silage in the semiarid regions of northeastern Brazil. Twenty-three hybrids were evaluated in a randomized block design with three replicates. The dry mass yield; dry mass of leaf, stem, panicle, grains, and senescent matter; and chemical composition of the plant were evaluated. The pH, ammoniacal nitrogen (N-NH3), and chemical composition of the silage were also assessed. The hybrids 947252, FEPAGRO 18, 12F042226, and SF 11 performed best in terms of morphological characteristics, with the highest mass of leaves and grains. The hybrid FEPAGRO 19 had the highest dry matter value (443.3 ± 17.0 g kg-1), whereas the hybrid 12F042496 had the lowest value (271.3 ± 17.0 g kg-1). The dry matter (DM) content of the other hybrids was within the recommended values for silage production (280 to 400 g kg-1). High levels of crude protein were observed in the grouped hybrids 12F042496, 947254, and 12F042422. The hybrid 12F042496 had the highest neutral detergent fiber content. The hybrids 9929036, 9929030, 9929012, 947254, 947072, PROG 134 IPA, 12F042226, 12F042422, and BRS 506 had pH values ranging between 3.8 and 4.2, indicating good quality silage. Overall, the sorghum hybrids 9929030, 12F042224, 12F042150, FEPAGRO19, and FEPAGRO11 had the best growth and production characteristics, and plant and silage chemical composition, and are thus recommended for the production of silage in the semiarid of northeastern Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39476/28081,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Efficiency of chitosan synergism with clove essential oil in the coating of intentionally contaminated Tambaqui fillets,"The edible coating of chitosan with clove essential oil (CEO) was studied for its ability to reduce the microbial growth of pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7 CDCEDL933, Listeria monocytogenes CERELA, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC13076, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC43300, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853) in Tambaqui fillets kept under refrigeration. In in vitro tests, chitosan showed higher antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes (MIC 0.5%), and CEO for L. monocytogenes (MIC 0.08%). Based on the antimicrobial activity of chitosan and CEO, Tambaqui fillets were subjected to different treatments, T1: chitosan 2%; T2: chitosan 2% + CEO 0.16%, and T3: chitosan 0.5% + CEO 0.08%, kept at 4 ºC for 72 h. The chitosan coating, incorporated with CEO, inhibited microorganisms in Tambaqui fillets and enhanced coating efficiency (p < 0.05). It was most effective against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus at the lowest CEO concentration (0.08%). Chitosan coating in combination with CEO enhanced the antimicrobial effect of pathogens on Tambaqui fillets, increased their shelf life under refrigeration, and was more effective against Gram-positive pathogens than Gram-negative pathogens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39469/28080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Milk fatty acid composition in Holstein x Gyr dairy cows fed chopped elephantgrass-based diets containing two types of sunflower oil associated with two methods of concentrate feeding,"Two experiments were carried out in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with the objective of evaluating two methods of concentrate feeding for Holstein x Gyr cows fed 600 g kg-1 chopped elephantgrass-based diets supplemented at 45 g kg-1 DM with two types of sunflower oil (SO). The types of SO differed in the levels of oleic and linoleic fatty acids (FAs): high oleic/low linoleic acid – HO (73 and 10 g 100 g-1 FA, respectively) and medium oleic/medium linoleic acid – MO (43 and 34 g 100 g-1 FA, respectively). The concentrates containing HO SO or MO SO were supplied separately from the forage twice a day after the two milkings (TAD) or as part of a total mixed ration (TMR). In Experiment 1, a 4 x 4 Latin square design was used to evaluate the ruminal fermentation and degradation parameters in four rumen-cannulated cows (430±39 kg; 79±20 days in milk; 16.4±3.1 kg day-1 of milk). In Experiment 2, a randomized block design was used to evaluate the nutrient intake, plasma contents of metabolites and FAs, milk yield and composition, and FA profile of milk fat in 32 cows (444±84 kg; 75±31 days in milk; 15.4±4.8 kg day-1 of milk). The results were analyzed by mixed models (P ? 0.05). The TMR diets promoted higher nutrient intake and rumen fermentation (higher ammonia N, acetate, propionate and total volatile FA contents) without affecting milk, fat, protein and lactose yields. TAD-fed cows presented higher feed efficiency and produced milk fat with a more nutritionally desirable FA composition, with higher vaccenic and rumenic acid contents and lower trans-10 C18:1 and palmitic acid contents. The DM intake, parameters of rumen fermentation and milk, fat, protein and lactose yields were similar for the HO SO and MO SO diets. The most nutritionally positive characteristics for human health in the milk fat of HO SO-fed cows were the higher eicosapentaenoic (+34%) and oleic acid (+11%) contents and lower palmitic acid content (-10%). Higher contents of vaccenic (+71%) and rumenic (+74%) acids and lower trans-10 C18:1 (-10%), elaidic (-32%), lauric (-14%) and myristic (-11%) acid contents were the most positive aspects of the milk fat of MO SO-fed cows. Considering the magnitudes of the differences in the levels of these FAs, it is concluded that the milk fat of cows fed MO SO showed a healthier milk FA profile.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39363/28077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Economic-financial analysis of the use of the detoxified castor by alkaline solutions I: production of arrays of dairy goats,"We evaluated the influence of totally substituting soybean meal (SM) with detoxified castor cake (DCC) and two alkaline products on the economic and financial viability of producing Saanen and Anglo-Nubian goat dairy breeds with initial body weights of 16.22 ± 0.67 kg that had been confined until they were capable of reproduction (70% of total body weight). The goats were subjected to six simulated production systems (PS). These were PS1, rearing Saanen goats that were fed with a standard diet based on SM; PS2, rearing Anglo-Nubian goats that were fed with a standard diet based on SM; PS3, rearing Saanen goats that where fed with a standard diet based on DCC Ca(OH)2; PS4, rearing Anglo-Nubian goats that were fed with a standard diet based on DCC Ca(OH)2; PS5, rearing Saanen goats fed with a standard diet based on DCC NaOH; and PS6, rearing Anglo-Nubian goats that were fed with a standard diet based on DCC NaOH. A descriptive economic and financial evaluation of the data was carried out using AVETEC® software. The SM based diets cost approximately 58.70% and 66.22% more for the Saanen and the Anglo-Nubian goats than the other diets, respectively. The results showed that all the scenarios had a point of leveling (PL) values of less than 144 goats, which is the number of animals that can be produced annually by each system simulated in this research. The net revenue for all the systems was greater than zero, which indicated that their activities were stable and that the internal rates of return were high. The profitability indices were also very good, especially the systems that used Saanen goats, because the NPV were higher than 1 million reais. Sensitivity analyzes showed that the indicators of performance were only economically unviable under the least favorable situations, such as 30% reductions in both production and market price. The use of the DCC does not compromise the economic viability of the systems and produces higher returns than the systems that used the standard (SM) diet.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37696/28072,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Survey on the types of nesting of Africanized honeybees in urban areas of semiarid regions and rationalization of swarm capture for the benefit of the community,"Africanized honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) are abundant and widely adaptable insects that spread rapidly in tropical environments. However, their strong defensive instinct can lead to attacks on humans and animals, causing disturbances in cities. This study aimed to evaluate the nesting characteristics of Africanized honeybees in Mossoró, RN, to generate relevant information for the control of the population of these insects and prevent accidents in urban areas in the Brazilian Semiarid. This survey was conducted from April 2015 to March 2018. The following information on swarms was collected from 487 recorded occurrences: date of survey, structure of the bee site, occurrence of nesting, population size, defensiveness of the bees, and presence of queen and drones. Although the swarms reproduced throughout the year, the breeding of queens and drones increased in the rainy season (January-June). Peak swarming occurred in April-September, when there is greater availability of flowers in the region and the average ambient temperature is mild. The swarms adopted a generalist approach when choosing their nesting site, occupying structures such as tires, tree trunks, buckets, sewage, and cardboard boxes. Most swarms were found in open sites (exposed swarms). The Africanized honeybees were more selective when looking for a nest construction site than when looking for a temporary site for landing and resting. The swarms were generally small (up to 20,000 bees) and not very defensive, which facilitated their rescue in populous urban areas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39370/28079,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Evaluation of rehydrated corn grain silage with okara or soybean inclusion in the performance of lactating cows,"This study aimed to evaluate dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, milk production and composition, and feed efficiency of cows fed corn grain silages with okara or raw soybean inclusion. Six Holstein cows were distributed in a double Latin square and arranged in the following treatments: concentrate formulated based on corn grain silage with 30% okara inclusion; concentrate of corn grain silage with 20% raw soybean inclusion, and concentrate based on dry corn grains. Statistical analysis was performed using Bayesian inference. Diets formulated with silages reduced dry matter intake compared to the diet of concentrate based on dry grains. High digestibility of DM, OM, NFC, and EE was observed for diets with silage inclusion. Milk presented an increase in CLA for the diet of corn grain silage diet with soybean inclusion. Rehydrated grain corn silage with soybean or okara inclusion reduced dry matter intake and increased nutrient digestibility, maintaining the same milk production, which demonstrates the higher efficiency of these diets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39287/28076,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Fermentative profile and nutritive value of corn silage with Tamani guinea grass,"The use of silage has been an efficient alternative to feed supply during the shortage of roughage in dry periods, providing quality feed that is widely used in ruminant feeding. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the fermentative characteristics and nutritive value of corn silage with Tamani guinea grass (Panicum maximum BRS cv. Tamani) through chemical composition, in vitro dry matter digestibility and protein fractionation. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications. The treatments consisted of five silages: corn; corn with 10% Tamani guinea grass; corn with 20% Tamani guinea grass; corn with 30% Tamani guinea grass; and corn with 40% Tamani guinea grass, totalling 20 experimental silos. The addition of tamani grass to silages was determined based on fresh matter. For ensiling, corn was harvested with 320 g kg-1 DM (dry matter) and Tamani guinea grass in a 30-day development cycle with 286 g kg-1 DM. After 50 days of silage, the silos were opened to analyse the fermentative characteristics, chemical composition and protein fractionation of the silage. The results showed that the addition of Tamani guinea grass in corn silage increased the pH and buffering capacity and reduced the dry matter and lactic acid concentration but did not compromise the fermentative characteristics of silages. The addition of 40% Tamani guinea grass in corn silage provided increased levels of crude protein, in vitro dry matter digestibility, protein A, B1 and C, and decreased the fractions B3 and C, which makes Tamani guinea grass an alternative to improve the quality of exclusive corn silage, resulting in better quality silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39282/28108,E-ISSN 1679-0359

41,2020,"Identification of Leishmania spp. in horses and a dog from rural areas of Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan of the genus Leishmania. The disease is transmitted by the bite of a sand fly vector. Although the main reservoirs are dogs, other hosts can be infected and may play this role. Rio Grande do Sul western region, located on the triple border of Brazil-Uruguay-Argentina, represents a VL transmission area. The goal of the present study was to identify Leishmania spp. infection in animals from rural areas of Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul. Nine farms in the Uruguaiana municipality, Rio Grande do Sul state, were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 113 animals (canine [n=22], equine [n=91]) for detection of Leishmania spp. DNA was isolated and polymerase chain reaction was performed. Eight (7%) animals with Leishmania spp. infection were detected on two farms in the same geographical area, seven of which were horses and one was canine, all of which were asymptomatic. To investigate the species of Leishmania, one of the positive equine samples was subjected to direct sequencing, which confirmed the presence of L. infantum genetic material. Results of this study confirm the presence of L. infantum-infected animals in rural areas of Uruguaiana, and provide evidence supporting further investigation of risk factors for dissemination in such areas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38423/28070,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Evaluation of degradability and ruminal kinetics of soybean meal subjected to strategies to maximize protein escape from the rumen,"The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the in situ dry matter degradability and in situ crude protein degradability of soybean meal subjected to different treatments (thermal, chemical, tannins or saponins). The treatments were: conventional soybean (CON); soybean expeller (EXP); lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal (LIGS); condensed tannin-treated soybean meal (CTAN); hydrolysable tannin-treated soybean meal (HTAN) and Yucca schidigera extract-treated soybean meal (YUC). Samples of 5 g soybean meal were packed in nylon bags and incubated in the rumen of 2 fistulated cattle for seven incubation times (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours), in sequence were washed, dried and weighed. The ruminal kinetics parameters were calculated, and the experiment was completely randomized, with six treatments, four replicates each, with duplicates. The EXP and LIGS treatments showed lower crude protein disappearance (CPD) within 12 hours, the CON, HTAN and YUC treatments had the highest CPD, and the CTAN presented an intermediate value (41.84%) (P < 0.05). EXP had the lowest fraction “a” (soluble) of crude protein (CP) (10.1%) followed by LIGS and CTAN (average of 14.82%). EXP and LIGS had the highest rumen undegradable fraction of CP (57.35 and 51.62%), respectively. In addition, ruminal disappearance rates of dry matter and CP of the treatments ranged from 2.17 to 1.36% h-1 and from 2.63 to 1.2% h-1, respectively. The most efficient treatments to reduce ruminal protein degradation were EXP, LIGS and CTAN.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37920/28073,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in domestic cats from an urban area in Brazil,"We investigated the occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts shedding by domestic cats in an urban setting. The calculation of minimum sample size was based on an estimated prevalence of 10%, 5% absolute sampling error and a 5% significance level, resulting in 138 cats. A total of 612 owners of 2,290 cats had to be contacted for achieving the minimal sample size. In the end, only 55 owners accepted to participate in this investigation. Stool samples collected from 138 dogs were examined by microscopy using modified Kinyoun acid-fast staining, capture ELISA and nested-PCR followed by sequencing. Samples were considered positive when Cryptosporidium were detected by at least two diagnostic methods. Thirteen samples were positive (9.4%; 95% CI: 4.5 - 14.3). Cryptosporidium amplicons from seven out of the 13 samples were successfully sequenced and shared 99% genetic similarity to Cryptosporidium felis, GenBank access AF112575.1 was found. We concluded that Cryptosporidium infection is common in domestic cats from urban area and veterinary practitioners should guide cat owners to adopt preventive measures against the parasite to reduce the chance of infection in cats and householders.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38387/28069,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Assessment of caseous lymphadenitis in goats in a slaughterhouse in the Brazilian semi-arid region and estimates of economic losses due to carcass condemnation,"Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) caused by the pathogenic bacterium, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, results in economic loss in goat farming. Its prevalence in Brazilian herds varies from 5 to 50%, generating expenses with treatment, loss in production, carcass and organ condemnation, and reduced price of the hide. This study aimed to describe the distribution of lesions and quantify the loss associated with CLA in goat breeding due to condemnation in a slaughterhouse located in a semiarid region. The study was conducted at the municipal slaughterhouse of the city of Patos, State of Paraíba, Northeastern Brazil, where goats from this intermediate geographical region are slaughtered. In 2017, 3,662 animals were slaughtered, an average of 305 per month. During the study period, from March to August 2017, 304 goats of both sexes and different ages of undefined breed were assessed. In the ante-mortem examination, inspection and palpation of the superficial lymph nodes was done; in the post-mortem examination, organ and viscera were assessed. The caseous material collected was sent for microbiological analysis. Of the 304 individuals, 227 [74.67% (95% CI: 69.50-79.23)] did not have any lesions, while 77 [25.33% (95% CI: 20.77-30.50)] showed abscesses suggestive of CLA, which was confirmed in 65 goats [84.41% (95% CI: 76.30-92.50)]. Sex (P = 0.044) and age (P = 0.002) were associated with infection. While the sex of the animals affected carcass and viscera weights and carcass yield, their age affected live weight, carcass, organ, and viscera weights; conversely, the incidence of CLA did not affect these variables. The average price in Real (R$) of a kilogram (kg) of goat meat cuts and ""offal"" was used to calculate the economic loss. Considering the average carcass weight (11,485 kg), organ weight (1,085 kg), and viscera weight (2,013 kg), 4,433.232 kg of meat was produced, resulting in R$ 72,945.43. The condemnations resulted in the loss of 269.894 kg, which is equivalent to R$ 4,540.33. CLA is responsible for a negative impact of 6.09% on production. Implementing control measures for this disease is important to increase the financial return in goat farming.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38049/28067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Effect of additional PGF2? dose on pregnancy rate in Nellore females subjected to FTAI,"This study examined the effect of administering an additional dose of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2?), in a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol (FTAI), on the fertility of female Nellore cattle. Two experiments were carried out: the first (Experiment I) took place in the state of Tocantins and the second (Experiment II) in the state of Pará, Brazil. In Experiment I (E1), 80 cows were used in three treatments (T1, T2 and T3) in which all received the same FTAI protocol. In T1 (n = 29), the cows received 12.5 mg of Dinoprost on day 9; in T2 (n = 28), they received the additional dose on day 10; and in T3 (n = 23; control group), the animals did not receive the additional PGF2? dose. Experiment II consisted of 147 bovine females distributed into two treatment groups, namely, T1 - 72 animals receiving the same protocol as T1 of E1; and T2 - 75 animals receiving the same protocol as T3 of E1. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software, applying the PROC NPARWAY procedure for E1, and means were compared by the Wilcoxon test at the 5% significance level. In Experiment II, the data were subjected to analysis of variance by PROC GLIMMIX and means were compared by the T test at the 5% significance level. The following pregnancy rates were obtained in Experiment I: T1 - 62.06% (18/29); T2 - 57.14% (16/28); and T3 - 52.17% (12/23), with no significant difference observed between treatments. In Experiment II, pregnancy rate in T1 was 66.67% (48/72), whereas in T2 it was 41.33% (31/75), with a significant difference detected (P < 0.05). An additional dose of PGF2? provides an increase in pregnancy rate in Nellore females.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38329/28068,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,In vitro embryo production in Nelore cows supplemented with calcium salts of long-chain fatty acid,"This study was performed to evaluate the effects of supplementation of lactating Nelore cows with calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids (Ca-LCFA) of soybean oil on in vitro oocytes competency, cleavage rate, embryo production rate, pregnancy rate, and sex ratio of transferred embryos. Fifteen multiparous Nelore cows grazed on a Tifton 85 pasture were allotted to two treatments: (1) supplement without fat inclusion (CONT, n = 6) and (2) supplement containing 47.2 g Ca-LCFA /kg (to provide an intake of 0.2 kg Ca-LCFA/day) based on dry matter (n = 9). Animals were subjected to 2.53 ± 1.35 rounds of consecutive ovum pick up at intervals of 27.65 ± 21.72 days. Oocytes were morphologically evaluated, selected, maturated, fertilized, and cultivated for embryo production in vitro and then transferred into recipients who had previously undergone an embryo transfer protocol at a fixed time. The number of aspirated oocytes, the proportion of viable oocytes, cleavage rate, embryo percentage, pregnancy rate, and sex ratio were not affected when Nelore cows were supplemented with Ca-LCFA of soybean oil compared with non-supplemented Nelore cows. In conclusion, our results suggest that feeding a supplement containing 47.2 g Ca-LCFA/kg (to provide an intake of 0.2 kg Ca-LCFA/day) to Nelore cows does not affect in vitro embryo production in lactating Nelore cows. However, further studies using higher dietary doses of fat could be useful to determine the potential of fat supplementation to improve in vitro embryo production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37927/28066,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Biological activity using dynamic speckle in blood serum of mares in different reproductive stages,"This study aimed to evaluate the biological activity in blood serum plasma samples from mares at different reproductive stages using dynamic speckle analysis. For this purpose, samples were collected from 40 Mangalarga Machador mares from the Formoso 2S horse farm in Cajueiro, AL. The mares were classified into four groups of ten animals each according to the pregnancy stage: ten empty mares (not pregnant), ten pregnant mares in the early third of pregnancy between one month and four months, ten pregnant mares in the final third of the pregnancy between seven and eleven months, and ten lactating mares (within two months post-partum). The biological activity response using a dynamic speckle (biospeckle) was obtained by capturing images reflected by a coherent light (diode laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and intensity of 3 mW) on a sample using a CCD (charge coupled device) camera. This data was analyzed using image processing techniques through the computational application Speckle-THSP-MCO-Descritores (STMD), applying THSP (time history speckle pattern) methodology, which evaluates the temporal evolution of the interference image from spreading over the sample surface over time. A coherence matrix generated from the THSP was used to present the intensity module dispersion, which provided the bioactivity data. These data were then processed using the program OriginPro 8. Ink, generate graphs and compare the results from the different groups under study. A general biospeckle signature was observed regardless of the mares’ reproductive stage considered in this study. A short phase of movement of the samples associated with an accommodation of the drop on the slide was observed. It was followed by an ascending curve starting between 5 and 10 min of observation, reaching a peak within 15 and 25 min, and finally decayed uniformly until almost zero after 45 min. The group of pregnant mares in the final third of pregnancy presented superior bioactivity compared to pregnant mares in the early third of pregnancy. The curve observed for the group of lactating mares is similar to the curve obtained for the group of pregnant mares in the early third of pregnancy. Bioactive molecules act as dispersion elements of coherent light incident on a sample. The variation inherent to the presence of bioactive molecules in the different stages evaluated influenced the biospeckle pattern detected in each sample. It was concluded that the biological activity peaks of the blood plasma samples from the mares evaluated in this study using the dynamic speckle analysis technique were different for both amplitude and time of occurrence, according to the different reproductive stages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37311/28065,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Optimisation of the extraction process of antioxidant capacity compounds from beet (Beta vulgaris L.) stalk,"Beet is a traditional root consumed worldwide and is considered a potential source of several bioactive compounds, yet during production and commercialisation activities, its leaves and stalks are discarded. The beet residue has notable quantities of diverse phenolic compounds that are not taken advantage of it. The beet stalks (sample) were obtained from a local producer at the municipality of Marechal Cândido Rondon, Paraná state, Brazil. The optimisation of the extraction process of antioxidant capacity compounds from beet stalk was done by response surface methodology (RSM), with three independent variables (time, from 5 to 85 min; temperature, from 20 to 80 °C and solvent, from 0 to 100% of ethanol/water ratio). Extracts were evaluated for their reducing capacity, measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu method, and antioxidant capacity by the ability to scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals. The optimal global extraction conditions determined were 5 min, 80 °C and 50% ethanol, yielding 13.157 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) g–1, 21.539 mol Trolox equivalents g-1 (TE; DPPH) and 250.190 ?mol TE g–1 (ABTS). Beet stalk demonstrated to be an alternative and rich source of recovering of natural antioxidant compounds, showing higher contents when compared to other agro-industrial residues.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39283/28063,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Survival assessment of Salmonella enterica in inoculated pork salami,"Pork salami is an embedded, cured and ripened product commonly consumed in Brazil, and the presence of Salmonella enterica has already been reported in this product. During its preparation, the microbiological safety depends on the meat quality, addition of ingredients with antimicrobial activity, hygiene during processing, pH and water activity (Aw) reduction during maturation. In Brazil, the maturation protocol has not been determined in food regulation; therefore, the objectives of this study were (a) to identify the fermentation and drying phases during salami maturation; (b) to test the survival of S. enterica during salami processing; and (c) to compare xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) and thin agar layer (TAL) agar for recovering Salmonella. The salami samples were prepared with a cocktail of S. enterica strains, fermented at 30°C and dried at 20°C with controlled relative humidity (RH). Periodic sampling for S. enterica quantification and Aw and pH analyses were performed during maturation, and curves were constructed. Fermentation occurred during the first 66 hours, and the pH decreased while the population of S. enterica increased over the first 21 hours. The drying step was able to reduce the bacterial population by approximately 5 log CFU after 875 hours, reaching an Aw of less than 0.78. However, elimination of S. enterica was not achieved. For Salmonella recovery, TAL agar was more efficient than XLD agar.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38102/28062,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Modeling and analysis of greenhouse environmental factors in north China based on path analysis and stepwise regression,"To explore the relationship between environmental factors in a greenhouse on sunny/cloudy days, an environmental factor model was developed using path analysis and stepwise regression analysis. The environmental factors studied include greenhouse air temperature (GAT), greenhouse air humidity (GAH), soil temperature (ST), soil humidity (SH), greenhouse radiation (GR), and carbon dioxide concentration (CDC). The results showed that on a sunny day, the models can describe the GAT and GAH well (R2=0.957, 0.936), and the model’s tested determination coefficient was above 0.87. However, due to the delay and other main control factors of ST and SH, the models’ determination coefficient was poor (R2=0.587, 0.625). However, there was a fifth-order polynomial fitting relationship between ST and SH (R2=0.817). On a cloudy day, the coupling effect between dependent variables and environmental factors was well described (R2 ? 0.97). The model test results for GAT and ST were better (R2=0.997, 0.981), and the GAH and SH model test results were also good (R2=0.789,0.882). In summary, the established coupling model of greenhouse environmental factors was suitable for simple greenhouse environment prediction, allowing greenhouse managers to easily predict greenhouse environmental change trends and reduce the cost of testing, laying a foundation for the subsequent establishment of a simpler, more accurate greenhouse factor model.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40031/28060,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Antagonism of saprobe fungi from semiarid areas of the Northeast of Brazil against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and biocontrol of soybean white mold,"The antagonistic activity of 25 saprobe fungi from semiarid areas of Northeast Brazil was evaluated against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (Helotiales: Sclerotiniaceae). Four fungi [Myrothecium sp. Tode (Hypocreales: Stachybotryaceae) isolate 2, Volutella minima Höhn. (Hypocreales: Nectriaceae), Phialomyces macrosporus P.C. Misra & P.H.B. Talbot (Pezizomycotina) and Dictyosporium tetraseriale Goh, Yanna & K.D. Hyde (Pleosporales: Dictyosporiaceae)] were selected and further tested their ability to inhibit mycelial growth, sclerotia formation and ascospore germination of S. sclerotiorum and to control white mold on soybean plants. V. minima and P. macrosporus filtrates at 50% effectively suppressed mycelial growth and Myrothecium sp. isolate 2 completely suppressed sclerotia formation and inhibited ascospore germination by over 95%, the same result as commercial fungicide fluazinam. Soybean plants pre-treated with Myrothecium sp. isolate 2, P. macrosporus, and V. minima and inoculated with S. sclerotiorum showed a reduction of 55.8%, 79.7%, and 83.2% of area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) of white mold, respectively, in relation to water. Collectively, these results underline the antagonistic activity of V. minima, P. macrosporus, and Myrothecium sp. isolate 2 against S. sclerotiorum and their potential as biocontrol agents of soybean white mold.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40798/28061,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Production and profitability of crop rotation systems in southern Brazil,"Crop rotation is one of the pillars of conservation agriculture. This practice has offered a series of advantages in terms of improving soil physical, chemical, and biological conditions. These advantages result in yield increases for all economic crops involved in the rotation systems and may also reduce production costs. In this context, the aim of this study was to compare the profitability of crop rotation systems with different levels of crop diversification. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with five treatments and four replications. The treatments included one less diversified crop rotation system (control) with soybean and wheat and four more diversified crop rotation systems (involving three or more species), including soybean, wheat, black oats, maize, canola, barley, blue lupine, white oats, beans, radish, triticale, rye, hairy vetch, and sorghum, under no-tillage conducted during a three-year cycle. Analyses were conducted considering productivity, operating cost, and economic profit. The highest accumulated gross yields were obtained in the more diversified crop rotation systems. The results show that the more diversified crop rotation systems were more profitable. When the opportunity cost was included, the most diversified crop rotations presented greater economic feasibility. The less diversified crop rotation system presented a negative economic profit. The crop rotation systems including beans presented the highest economic profit.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38512/28057,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Production of watermelon irrigated with saline water in mulched Entisol with potassium fertilization,"The adjustment in the growing season associated with cultural practices can mitigate the negative effects of salinity on crop production. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the production components of watermelon cv. Crimson Sweet under the effects of irrigation with saline water, soil cover and potassium doses in crops during dry and rainy seasons. The treatments were arranged in a split plot with 2 x 2 x 4 scheme, with the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water (0.3 and 3.0 dS m-1) in the main plot, and the combinations between soil mulch (without and with) and doses of potassium (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha-1 of K2O) in the subplots, distributed in randomized blocks. Final stand, number of fruits per plant, average fruit weight, production per plant and yield were evaluated. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and potassium doses were evaluated by regression. In the rainy season, watermelon was more productive than in the dry season even under irrigation, with higher number of fruits and production per plant and yield. Irrigation using water with electrical conductivity of 3.0 dS m-1 should be used with moderation in watermelon crop, as it did not compromise yield. Potassium chloride application is not recommended in soil with intermediate potassium content, because it reduced the number of fruits per plant and yield. The use of mulch is recommended in watermelon cultivation, since it increased the number of fruits and production per plant.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38576/28086,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Physiological responses of watercress to brackish waters and different nutrient solution circulation times,"Water scarcity and the use of brackish water are the main challenges for agricultural development. In view of this, the present study proposes to examine physiological responses of the broadleaf-cress crop in an NFT hydroponics system according to the use of brackish water and nutrient solution circulation times. The treatments were distributed in a randomized block design with five water salinity levels (ECw: 0.6, 1.6, 2.6, 3.6 and 4.6 dS m-1) and two nutrient solution circulation times (T1 = 10 min and T2 = 15 min), totaling 10 treatments with four replicates, which resulted in 40 experimental plots. The following variables were analyzed: net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, leaf proline content, shoot moisture content, stem diameter and root length. The maximum observed photosynthetic rates were 20.9 mmol m-2 s-1 (T1) and 20.0 mmol m-2 s-1 (T2). Maximum stomatal conductance was 0.44 mol m-2 s-1, which decreased by 63.4% at the highest salinity level.

41,2020,Yield and water use efficiency in 'Tommy Atkins' and 'Palmer' mango trees under localized irrigation with water deficit,"The increasing water demand of crops in response to climate change; the prospect of expanded irrigated areas; the population growth; and competition with multiple uses of water affect the availability of water resources for agriculture. Thus, measures are required that involve the adoption of irrigation-management strategies able to increase water savings without compromising crop yield, especially in semi-arid conditions, where water resources are limited, and in large-scale commercial cultivation such as in 'Tommy Atkins' and 'Palmer' mango, the second most widely grown irrigated fruit crop. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of irrigation systems (drip and micro-sprinkler) and deficit-irrigation strategies on the yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of 'Tommy Atkins' and 'Palmer' mango trees. The study was developed through two experiments conducted in the Irrigated Perimeter of Ceraíma, located in municipality of Guanambi - BA, Brazil. Two trials were carried out in a completely randomized design. For the 'Tommy Atkins' cultivar, 12 strategies were tested, involving regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) by micro-sprinkler irrigation and partial rootzone drying (PRD) by drip, in three production cycles. For ‘Palmer’ mango, 10 irrigation strategies were evaluated under the same previously described conditions, in only one production cycle. The reduction in water application in RDI was 25 and 50% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc); and, in PRD, 20, 40 and 60% ETc. ‘Tommy Atkins’ mango achieved higher yields under micro-sprinkler irrigation with full irrigation and in the strategies involving the application of 50 and 75% ETc in stages II and III. These two strategies also provided greater WUE, along with PRD40. Water use efficiency was lower in the third evaluation cycle when compared with the first. ‘Palmer’ mango showed higher yields and WUE under drip irrigation, with the best yields achieved with full irrigation and in the strategies of PRD100, 80%, 60% and RDI with 50% ETc in stage III. The best WUE was obtained in PRD with 60 and 40% ETc.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38303/28055,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Effect of flaxseed root performance on the structural quality of a Haplumbrept under conservationist management system, in Santa Catarina, Brazil","Our goal was to evaluate the root development of flaxseed and its relationship with soil aggregation and organic carbon storage in two sowing seasons under soil conservationist management, in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We used three flaxseed genotypes: Aguará and Caburé from Argentina, and Gold from Brazil, sowings in April and May in a no-tillage system under Haplumbrept. In the flowering stage, the root system was evaluated by image analyze using a Safira software. Root distribution maps were used by geostatistical kriging. At the harvest stage, soil blocks were sampled for analyze the aggregates morphometry by image with Quantporo software and the soil organic carbon. Undisturbed soil were sampled to determine the physical attributes. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with three repetitions, anova was performed by Fisher and the means compared by Tukey test. No physical impediments were found for the roots performance in the Haplumbrept under conservationist management system, these favored the irregularity of the aggregates surface observed by the low values of aspect and roughness in the different tested diameter ranges. Both Caburé and Aguará genotypes showed good roots spatial distribution in the soil profile in both sowing seasons with an increase in carbon storage in the smallest diameter aggregates (here considered the aggregates of 4.76-1 mm). Caburé genotype is the best genotype adapted to the edaphoclimatic conditions evaluated because had a greater roots volume, area and length below to 0.15 m depth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38407/28056,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Preservation by lactic fermentation and physicochemical characterization of okra produced underwater salinity and potassium fertilization,"The use of saline water in agricultural production will be increasingly necessary in the next decades. However, postharvest quality may be compromised, as in okra, due to salt stress and/or factors inherent to storage and transportation. In this context, developing alternative methods of preservation, including lactic fermentation, may be a promising way to maintain and even improve the nutritional quality of okra. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the production components of okra subjected to different levels of water salinity and doses of potassium fertilization, and further to evaluate the preservation by lactic fermentation of okra fruits produced under water salinity. The first experiment was carried out in lysimeters under field conditions in Neossolo Regolítico (Psamment) of sandy loam texture in Pombal-PB, in a randomized block design in a 5 x 5 factorial scheme, testing 5 levels of irrigation water salinity (0.3; 1.3; 2.3; 3.3, and 4.3 dS m-1) and 5 doses of potassium fertilization (75; 112.5; 150; 187.5, and 225 mg of K2O kg-1 of soil), with three replicates. After that, the okra fruits produced under the different salinity levels were stored in six mixtures of salts present in lactic fermentation brine (100-0-0, 0-100-0, 0-0-100, 50-50-0, 0-50-50, and 50-0-50 of NaCl, CaCl2, and KCl, respectively), under a 5 x 6 factorial, with three replicates, in a completely randomized design. The post-harvest quality, after fermentation, was evaluated based on their physicochemical characteristics. Irrigation water salinity negatively affected the average length, average weight, titratable acidity, soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio, and pH of the okra fruits. Potassium doses increased the average diameter of okra fruits, minimizing the deleterious effects of irrigation water salinity. The vitamin C contents of pickled okra fruits were not compromised by salt stress. Among the lactic fermentation brines, the formulation containing the proportion NaCl:CaCl2 stands out as promoting the highest titratable acidity and soluble solids content in pickled okra fruits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38268/28053,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Validation of a diagrammatic scale for quantification of bacterial leaf blight (causal agent Pseudomonas avenae) in maize,"Bacterial leaf blight occurs in almost the entire Brazilian territory and can cause significant economic damage. However, its effects can be curtailed with the following tools that aid in quantification for carrying out the best severity assessment that can be applied to the studies used in its control. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a diagrammatic scale to quantify the severity of bacterial leaf blight in maize caused by Pseudomonas avenae. Corn leaves were collected with different levels of disease severity, and the total leaf area as well as the injured area of the middle third of each leaf was measured. From this, the minimum and maximum limits of the disease and, subsequently, four intermediate levels were determined whilst taking into account the law of visual stimulus of Weber-Fechner. Levels 1.5%, 2.5%, 9%, 18%, 46%, and 70% were selected with validation performed by eight evaluators, four inexperienced and four experienced. These evaluators estimated the severity values, initially without the use of the proposed diagrammatic scale and in a second attempt with the use of the scale. We concluded that it was possible to improve the accuracy and precision of the evaluators when they used the scale as a tool to assess the severity of bacterial leaf blight on corn leaves.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36850/28051,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Effect of silicon on aphid populations and wheat yield in Minas Gerais, Brazil","The area cultivated with wheat has been increasing in the savannahs of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Aphids are usually one of the main pests of wheat in many regions of the world; however, little is known about the aphid population in this new environment. The southern region of Brazil, the main wheat production area, has had several problems as a result of aphids, but aphid populations and the resulting impact on wheat production have not been investigated in these new crop production areas. Understanding control strategies to manage this insect could be essential for the “Cerrado” wheat that is grown in this area. The application of silicon (Si) has the potential to reduce the population growth of wheat aphids; however no field studies have been reported. Hence, we evaluated the effect of Si fertilization via soil application on the aphid populations and species composition and on yield components of wheat in three locations in Minas Gerais; the experiment was repeated simultaneously in Uberlândia, at the experimental areas of UFU and IFTM, and in Montes Claros, at the experimental area of UFMG, using the cultivars BRS 264 and BRS 394. The aphids first appeared just before wheat earing; they were then sampled six times over the course of the study, seven days apart, starting from 45 days after sowing. The aphid species Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), and Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) were observed in all three locations; S. avenae was the dominant species in all locations. The experimental area of UFU had the highest number of S. avenae aphids per tiller for both cultivars, while UFMG had the lowest populations. Aphid populations and wheat yield components were not affected by soil Si fertilization. There was no difference in yield as a result of location or cultivar, but the location UFU and the cultivar BRS 394 had the greatest average hectoliter weight.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37651/28052,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Serological survey of porcine circovirus 2 antibodies in Northeastern Brazil by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay,"Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) specific antibodies were evaluated in pigs at 15 to 25 weeks of age by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Serum samples (n = 575) were obtained from 16 commercial farms located in six states of northeastern Brazil, including two in Ceará (n = 85), three in Rio Grande do Norte (n = 92), two in Paraíba (n = 49), three in Pernambuco (n = 107), two in Alagoas (n = 39), and four in Bahia (n = 203). Out of the 575 evaluated sera, 470 (81.74%) were reagents with antibody titers ranging from 20 to 5,120. All farms presented reactive animals. There was a statistically significant difference in reactivity proportions between the states of Bahia and Ceará (p < 0.05) and between Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte (p < 0.05).

41,2020,Evaluation and characterization of triticale silage (x. Triticosecale wittmack) to replace Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (S. vulgare Pers.) silage as feed for beef cattle,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional quality of silages containing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% triticale replacing sorghum silage feed for beef cattle. It was carried out fractionation of carbohydrates and proteins, and the parameters of ruminal degradation kinetics estimated by semiautomatic in vitro method of cumulative gas production of the silages. The experimental design completely randomized with five treatments and four replicates. Sorghum silage has less non-fibrous carbohydrates, and its substitution may explain the linear increase in the composition of fractions A and B1. In general, the proportions of fractions ""A"" and ""B1 + B2"" demonstrated that as sorghum replaced by triticale, the abundance of high availability proteins increased, as did the abundance of rapidly degradable proteins in the rumen. The final volume of gases produced by the fermentation of non-fibrous carbohydrates presented a negative linear relationship with increased triticale silage (P = 0.0001), while the degradation rates presented a positive linear relationship (P = 0.0001). Thus, there was rapid release of energy and nitrogen, which may meet the needs of microorganisms. Therefore, triticale silage can be substituted for sorghum silage in cattle feed as an excellent source of protein and energy without altering nutritional parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37191/26455,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Evaluation of resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae in four farmed strains of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus),"Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) has always been considered more resistant to diseases compared to other fish species. However, in recent decades, this fish species has also been susceptible to many bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and nutritional diseases. In Brazil, streptococcosis is one of the main diseases that affect tilapia and has caused many economic losses. A resistance test was conducted with 93 tilapia of four varieties (UFLA strain and three commercial varieties: SC1, SC2, and SC3) to evaluate resistance to experimental inoculation with Streptococcus agalactiae. Each variety was distributed in five aquariums, with nine specimens of the same variety. Among the five aquariums, four housed fish were intraperitoneally inoculated with 107 CFU/fish of S. agalactiae and one aquarium harbored fish from the control group, which received 0.1 mL of sterile BHI (Brain Heart Infusion). Significant differences were observed in the survival rates accumulated at the end of the experiment (day 15), with values of 22, 36, 36, and 15% for SC1, SC2, SC3, and UFLA, respectively. The UFLA strain presented lower survival than other strains, which did not differ among the 15 days of challenge. These results demonstrate that there are animals with a better response to the resistance test than others.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35337/26815,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Nutritive value of improved populations Brachiaria ruziziensis,"A low number of Brachiaria ruziziensis (Syn. Urochloa) cultivars available on the market and a lack of information about its forage potential have made it difficult to expand its cultivated area, and have therefore made it necessary to implement a breeding program for this species. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the nutritional value of ten improved populations of Brachiaria ruziziensis (Syn. Urochloa) and two controls (B. ruziziensis cv. Kennedy and B. brizantha cv. Marandu). The experimental design was a randomized block design with three replications in five sections. The data were submitted to analysis of variance in the subdivided plot in which the primary factors were the populations and the secondary cuts. The Tukey test was used at 5% of significance for the comparison of means. The genotypes used came from the third recurrent selection cycle of Embrapa dairy cattle, originating from the interbreeding of clones which had been identified as superior. The height of the cuts was 10 cm in relation to the ground. The material was cut and weighed in the field to obtain the sample weights to determine the nutritional forage value. After drying, the samples were ground in 1 mm sieves for chemical analyzes and in vitro digestibility. The best CP, ADF and NDF levels observed in IV populations (lower levels of ADF and NDF at 93 days of cut interval and lower NDF contents at 35 and 41 days of cut interval), population VI (higher CP content in the interval of 93 days, lower DM content at 64 and 93 days of cut interval, and lower NDF content at 35 and 64 days of cut interval) showed that these populations can be evaluated under grazing even at an advanced maturation stage. The objective of these selections was to evaluate the nutritional value of improved populations of Brachiaria ruziziensis (Syn. Urochloa) in order to obtain more homogeneous populations for implantation of grazing experiments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36439/26454,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Characterization of Brachiaria humidicola cv. BRS Tupi,"This study aimed to carry out the morphogenic, structural, and bromatological characterization of Brachiaria humidicola cv. BRS Tupi. A completely randomized design was adopted. The treatments consisted of harvesting the forage at 14, 28, 42, and 56 days. Leaf appearance rate, leaf elongation rate, and phyllochron were similar among the treatments (P > 0.05). However, leaf life span varied among treatments (P < 0.05). Dry matter exhibited linear behavior (P < 0.05) whereas mineral matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and lignin had quadratic behavior. Brachiaria humidicola cv.

41,2020,Choline and digestible methionine + cystine supplementation for quail in the laying phase,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of levels of choline and digestible methionine + cystine in diets for quail in the laying phase. A total of 280 Japanese laying quail were assigned to one of eight treatments in a completely randomized design in a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of dietary supplementation with four levels of choline (0.0, 0.042, 0.084 and 0.126%) and two levels of digestible methionine + cystine (0.857 and 0.685%), with five replicates and seven birds per plot. The experimental period was 84 days, represented by four 21-day evaluation cycles in which quail performance and egg quality were evaluated. There was no interaction effect between the factors for any of the studied variables, except quail weight. The highest tested levels of methionine + cystine and choline supplementation improved egg weight, feed conversion egg mass?1 and yolk percentage. By contrast, albumen percentage decreased linearly as choline inclusion in the diet was elevated. The choline supplementation levels induced a quadratic response from eggshell percentage, whose optimum result was estimated at the choline level of 0.05% in the diet. Egg specific gravity decreased linearly as choline supplementation was increased. The indicated level of digestible methionine + cystine in the diet of Japanese quail in the laying phase is 0.857%, while choline should be supplemented at 0.126%.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36399/26452,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Information asymmetry among dairy producers in Paraná, Brazil","Milk production has great social and economic importance in Paraná, Brazil. However, dairy farmers have abandoned the activity over the past few years because of difficulties in meeting institutional and market demands for increased milk production and quality. Information asymmetry between dairy farmers and market agents may be contributing to this scenario. It occurs when one agent in a transaction has more or better information than another. Information asymmetry can encourage opportunistic behavior and negatively affect the relationship between parties. These problems can be minimized or resolved by horizontal collaboration, such as participation in farmers’ organizations, cooperatives, or associations. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of information asymmetry among dairy farmers and investigate whether participation in farmers’ organizations strengthens buyer–seller relationships and stimulates compliance with milk quality standards. A total of 204 semi-structured questionnaires were applied to head farmers of dairy production systems in Paraná. Two sets of variables were analyzed: variables related to socio-economic and production characteristics and variables related to transactions between farmers and the dairy industry and the head farmer’s knowledge about milk quality regulations. The second set of variables was subjected to common factor analysis, which generated four factors: F1, knowledge about institutional requirements; F2, technical support from the buyer; F3, technical knowledge; and F4, level of trust in the buyer. Dairy farmers who did not participate in farmers’ organizations operated under greater information asymmetry and were disadvantaged with regard to F2, F3, and F4 (P < 0.05). Participation in horizontal collaborations can help farmers survive and thrive in the dairy activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36387/31779,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Adaptability of sheep to three salinity levels in different environments,"The objective of this study is to evaluate physiological parameters and the adaptability of Santa Inês sheep to two climatic conditions 25ºC (within the thermal comfort zone [TCZ) and 32ºC (above the TCZ) and three salinity levels (2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 dS m-1). The study was developed in a climatic chamber using 36 uncastrated male sheep. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 2 ? 3 factorial scheme composed of two temperatures, three water salinity levels, and six repetitions. The physiological variables were not affected by the salinity levels. The rectal and skin temperature and the heart and respiratory rate were higher at 32 °C. However, the rectal temperature was within the normal range for the species. The consumption of water with different salt concentrations did not affect the adaptive responses of the animals and could be an alternative water source for sheep in regions where water has a high salinity level. The respiratory rate of sheep exposed to 32 °C increased to eliminate body heat, and exposure to 25 °C provided greater thermal comfort for the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36351/26450,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Effect of sample size on kinetic parameters of roughage and concentrated feeds by a semi-automated in vitro gas production system,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different amounts of incubated samples on the kinetic parameters of in vitro fermentation of roughage and concentrated food used for feeding ruminants. Samples were prepared using 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg of air-dried roughage and concentrated sample, ground to 1 mm, and placed in 120 mL glass flasks. Next, inoculum and McDougal solution were added, and the readings were obtained using a semi-automated pressure transducer up to 96 h after the beginning of the incubations. Gas production of the non-fibrous fraction increased linearly (P < 0.05) for sugarcane, Marandu grass silage, corn silage, dried corn distillers’ grains with solubles, dried brewer’s yeast, bean residue, wet brewer’s grains, sunflower meal, and Jatropha meal; quadratically (P < 0.05) for Napier grass silage and cottonseed meal; and cubically (P < 0.05) for castor meal and soybean meal. The degradation rate of the non-fibrous fraction reduced linearly (P < 0.05) for sugarcane, Napier grass silage, and castor meal; quadratically (P < 0.05) for Marandu grass silage; and cubically (P < 0.05) for corn silage, soybean meal, dried corn distillers’ grains with solubles, bean residue, and cottonseed meal. Gas production of the fibrous fraction increased linearly (P < 0.05) for Napier grass silage, Marandu grass silage, corn silage, dried corn distillers’ grains with solubles, bean residue, wet brewer’s grain, cottonseed meal, and sunflower meal; quadratically ( < 0.05) for Jatropha meal; and cubically (P < 0.05) for sugarcane, castor meal, and soybean meal. The degradation rate of the fibrous fraction increased linearly (P < 0.05) for Napier grass silage, dried corn distillers’ grains with solubles, dried brewer’s yeast, wet brewer’s grains; quadratically (P < 0.05) for corn silage and castor meal; and cubically (P < 0.05) for sugarcane, Marandu grass silage, and bean residue. The lag time reduced linearly (P < 0.05) for castor meal and dried corn distillers’ grains with solubles; quadratically (P < 0.05) for Napier grass silage; and cubically (P < 0.05) for sugarcane, Marandu grass silage, corn silage, soybean meal, bean residue, cottonseed meal, sunflower meal, and Jatropha meal.

Composition and deposition variables were evaluated in a 4 × 5 factorial arrangement, with total analysed levels of 18, 44, 71, and 99 mg kg-1 of Cu and 0.613, 0.631, 0.816, 0.918, and 0.955% Met + Cys. We allocated four replicate cages (four hens/cage) to each treatment group. Two eggs per plot were sampled to determine the chemical composition of albumen and yolk, based on natural and dry matter and on daily rates of deposition. An interaction effect of Met + Cys and Cu levels was observed for deposition rates of ash and Cu in the yolk, and the chemical composition of Ethereal Extract (EE) and ash in eggs, EE in albumen and Nitrogen, EE, and ash in the yolk. An isolated effect was observed for Met + Cys on egg chemical composition and on shell and yolk fractions, as well as on deposition rates of albumen N, EE, and ash, and yolk EE. The yolk cholesterol content increased by 18.17% with increasing Met + Cys in diets. In conclusion, the chemical composition of eggs varied with dietary Met + Cys and organic Cu concentrations.

41,2020,Half a century of research on cattle foot and claw diseases: a scientometric analysis,"The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate scientific publications on cattle foot and claw diseases using the Scopus database. A combination of keywords ""hoof disease AND bovine OR cattle OR cow"" was used. Publications were classified according to the type, language, subject area, source title, author, affiliation, and country/territory. The documents were grouped later into thematic topics. The diseases evaluated in each study were quantified separately and in related groups, and distributed by decades. The frequencies of the thematic topics and diseases were compared by the chi-square test for adherence. In total, 642 publications were analyzed (595 articles, 46 reviews, and 1 note). Most of these papers were written in English (518). The main subject areas were Veterinary; Agricultural and Biological Sciences; and Biochemistry, Genetics, and Molecular Biology. Journal of Dairy Science was the journal that published most articles in the area, with the best citations (SCImago Journal Rank = 1.21). The authors with the highest number of publications were Johann Kofler with 19, and David Nixon Logue and Jan Keith Shearer with 18 documents each. By affiliation, the institution with the highest number of publications was the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. By country or territory, the United States of America (22%), the United Kingdom (17%), Germany (11%), and Canada (10%) together accounted for 60% of the publications. The classification of the documents into thematic topics resulted in four groups: Specific hoof diseases (70%), General hoof diseases (14%), Lameness (11%), and Healthy hoof characterization (5%). Eighteen foot and claw diseases have been studied, with the following being the most frequent: digital dermatitis (17%), sole ulcer (15%), and white line disease (11%). When grouped, laminitis-related diseases represented 48% and infectious diseases represented 38% of the studies. Overall, just over half a century of research on cattle foot and claw diseases, bovine digital dermatitis is the most studied disease. Grouping related disorders revealed that laminitis-related diseases are being studied more than infectious diseases since the 1980s, from when studies on individual foot diseases in cattle increased to the detriment of studies that aimed to evaluate them as a unique problem. Our study, the first scientometric analysis in the subject area, compiles valuable information that can help researchers to develop future projects.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36340/26446,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Meta-analysis of corn plants, green fodder (ensilage), and silages of different types of maize hybrids used in experimental conditions in Brazil","The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of scientific publications from January 1994 to December 2014, to evaluate the chemical composition of corn plants, green forage, and silages of three different types of maize hybrids (simple, double, and triple) used in experimental conditions in Brazil. The sub-bases Corn Cultivation and Green Fodder were composed of 49 experiments, consisting of 481 treatments, and the sub-base Silage consisted of 24 studies composed of 163 treatments, involving 478 silos. In the Corn Cultivation sub-base, the variables of spacing, plant height, grain yield, organic matter content, and total carbohydrates of maize silage differed (P < 0.05) according to the hybrid type. The number of corn plants per hectare, number of spikes per plant, and the levels of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, and lignin did not differ (P > 0.05) according to the hybrid type. In the Green Forage sub-base (ensilage), the main difference (P < 0.05) was regarding the in vitro dry matter digestibility, whereby the triple hybrids (59.38%) had lower values than the simple (73.05%) and double (72.74%) hybrids. In the Silage sub-base, the variables of organic matter, total carbohydrates, cellulose, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and pH differed (P < 0.05) according to the hybrid type. While the variables dry matter, non-fibrous carbohydrates, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, lignin, total digestible nutrients, ethereal extract, crude protein, and ammonium nitrogen did not differ (P > 0.05) according to the hybrid type. The variability in the determination of parameters, such as dry matter yield, dry matter content, and non-fibrous carbohydrates of corn silage, and the non-determination of the starch content demonstrated that the chemical compositions of Brazilian corn silage have not yet been fully clarified. The types of maize hybrids (simple, double, and/or triple) mainly differ in terms of grain production. In many situations, the silage processes are not conducted in an ideal way, and the differences as a function of the maize plants (type of hybrid) are minimized due to losses during the ensiling process.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36209/26447,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Occurrence of gastrointestinal protozoans in cats from Londrina, Paraná, Brazil","Protozoans are widely distributed, and several species may parasitize the digestive tracts of cats (Felis catus), and can be transmitted to humans. The present study aimed to evaluate the species and occurrence of gastrointestinal protozoans in cats in the city of Londrina, Paraná, Brazil. A total of 206 cat fecal samples were tested, of which 141 were from shelter animals, and 65 were from pets owned by local people. Samples were processed by parasitological techniques. Coproparasitological techniques (Willis, Faust and Ziehl-Neelsen) were performed for detection of protozoan parasites. Subsequently, all samples were processed by PCR protocols specific to Toxoplasma gondii, Giardia spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. PCR products from positive samples were selected for sequencing. No samples were found to be positive for Cryptosporidium spp. using the Ziehl-Neelsen technique. Using specific PCR protocols, 1/206 (0.48%) samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. After purification, this one positive sample was sequenced, and it demonstrated a 100% identity match to Cryptosporidium muris. Using specific PCR protocols, 13/206 (9.22%) cat fecal samples tested, including 2/65 (3.08%) pet cat fecal samples, were positive for T. gondii. PCR analysis revealed that 37/206 (17.96%) of cat fecal samples were positive for Giardia spp., including 27/141 (19.15%) of shelter cat fecal samples, and 10/65 (15.38%) pet cat fecal samples (p = 0.5124). When sequenced, these positive samples showed a 100% identity match with Giardia duodenalis. This study demonstrated that infections with Cryptosporidium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Giardia duodenalis are present in the population of both pet cats and shelter cats in the city of Londrina. This poses a risk to public health, because these parasites have a high zoonotic potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36273/26445,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Applications of polymerase chain reaction for the detection of equine Leishmania sp. infection,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by a variety of pathogenic Leishmania species. In the New World, especially in Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by Leishmania infantum. The pathogen can infect several animal species including dogs, foxes, rodents, primates, felines, equines and humans. Dogs act as the primary domestic reservoirs. This study aimed to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting Leishmania infection in horses living in a canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) endemic region. DNA samples from horse peripheral blood were used to perform PCR. Templates were amplified using primers for the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircles, which were able to detect different species of Leishmania. In addition, primers for internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA were used for detection of Trypanosomatidae sp. Amongst the 75 (39%) positive PCR samples from total 192 samples, 21 samples were positive for kDNA and 63 samples were positive for either ITS, ITS1, or ITS2 gene markers. The kDNA PCR and sequencing allowed the detection of L. infantum in horse blood samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report of equine infection with L. infantum in Southern Brazil. These results proved that L. infantum could also infect horses in addition to humans and dogs, as well as in European countries. This conclusion emphasizes the urgent need to follow up investigation of the infection in these animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36172/26403,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Morphology, morphometry, and membrane integrity of epididymal spermatozoa of spotted pacas (Cuniculus paca, Linnaeus 1766)","The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphology, morphometry, and membrane integrity of epididymal spermatozoa of spotted pacas using spermatic cells collected from the epididymal tails of five animals. The flotation method using the ACP-123® and Botusemen Special® extenders was performed, and samples were stained in Diff-Quick and eosin-nigrosine. Descriptive statistics of data were obtained and Student’s t-test was performed. The morphology of 200 Diff-Quick-stained spermatozoa showed that they had an oval head with three vesicles in the acrosomal region, a midpiece, an elongated tail; moreover, 27% of the spermatozoa exhibited cellular defects. The morphometry of 100 sperm cells (analyzed with an optical microscope and the EZ Leica LAS software for Windows) presented the following measurements (mean ± SD): total length 43.87 ± 4.91 ?m, head 7.54 ± 0.82 ?m, midpiece 5.35 ± 0.83 ?m, tail 30.72 ± 2.55 ?m, and head width 5.30 ± 0.68 ?m. Of the 2,000 cells stained with eosin-nigrosine for membrane integrity evaluation, 83.8% diluted in ACP-123® and 72.9% diluted in Botusemen® had intact membranes. The results of this study suggest that epididymal spermatozoa of pacas can be used in assisted reproduction programs; moreover, our study adds knowledge to the reproductive biology of wild animals, and encourages further research on the role of the three acrosomal vesicles present in this species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36093/26444,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids increases its fluidity and can contribute to sperm motility. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of adding docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and ?-tocopherol (?-Toh) to the cooling extender, singly or combined, to the equine sperm parameters, submitted to cooling, up to 72 hours. Two ejaculates of ten stallions collected with artificial vagina were used, and evaluated for motility, plasma membrane integrity, chromatin fragmentation, mitochondrial activity and lipid peroxidation, according to the following treatments: C; DHA; ?-Toh; DHA/?-Toh; EtOH 100: and EtOH 140 (corresponding to control; 10 ng mL-1 of DHA; 2 mM of ?-Toh; : 10 ng mL-1 of DHA + 2 mM of ?-Toh; 100 µL of ethanol and 140 µL of ethanol respectively). DHA treatment showed higher motility (68.2 ± 12.3; p < 0.05) when compared to control (62.1 ± 16.2), DHA/?-Toh (61.3 ± 12.7) and EtOH (58.1 ± 8.6) groups. In lipid peroxidation assay, the control group showed 2,506.2 ± 796.4 ng of MDA 108 spermatozoa-1, being significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the groups treated with DHA (2,036.0 ± 687.0), ?-Toh (1,890.8 ± 749.5) and DHA/?-Toh (1,821.1 ± 627.2). In conclusion, ?-Toh was effective in diminishing lipid peroxidation of equine sperm subjected to cooling, and DHA improved sperm motility and, in spite of being a polyunsaturated fatty acid with high susceptibility to peroxidation, reduced lipid peroxidation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36068/26498,E-ISSN 1679-0359

We performed these examinations in 20 animals aged between 2 and 10 years on different dates (day 0 and day 30) before and after deworming with a vermifuge based on albendazole + cobalt. The changes caused by endoparasites and hemoparasites were observed and whether there was a satisfactory effect on deworming was evaluated. Trichuris spp., Strongyloides spp., and non-sporulated Eimeria spp. oocytes were detected during the examinations. Trichuris spp. had the highest incidence. We found no hemoparasites in any blood smears. In the first sampling, the eosinophilia and leukocytosis in the hemogram indicated parasitism in the animals. In the second sampling, the number of eosinophils decreased and the number of eggs and oocysts nearly disappeared in the coproparasitological examinations. The vermifuge showed an acceptable effect on sanitary management, and the hemogram was consistent with animal hygiene.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36144/26402,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Leptospirosis in free-living capybaras (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) from a university campus in the city of Araras in São Paulo, Brazil","The capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris L. 1766) is the largest existing rodent in the world. This animal species, being synanthropic, may serve as a transmitter of different diseases and parasitic infections in animals and humans as well. Leptospirosis is a cosmopolitan infectious disease with a high prevalence in tropical and subtropical regions that can affect humans and other domestic and wild animals. Due to the absence of regional data and the importance of this animal species in transmitting diseases to animals and humans, the aim of this study was to analyze DNA and anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in free-living capybaras (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) from a university campus in the city of Araras in São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 31 capybaras (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) were captured for collecting their blood samples. The collected sera were analyzed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). For the detection of Leptospira spp. DNA, the serum samples were used to extract genomic DNA for the nested-PCR analysis. Out of the 31 serum samples, 29 (93.55%) were reactive for MAT, with titers ranging from 25 to 400. The antibody could be identified against the most probable serovar in 26 (89.65%) samples, namely: Grippotyphosa (69.23%), Autumnalis (26.92%), and Bratislava (3.85%). Presence of Leptospira via nested-PCR was found only in 3.22% of serum samples. This study revealed the presence of DNA and anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in free-living capybara. Characterization of these animals as possible carriers and disseminators of the etiological agent in the environment is necessary for identification of infection in other animals and campus visitors.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35381/26443,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Scrotal thermography to assess the seminal quality in Nelore and Girolando bulls,"Bull selection by andrological examination aims to estimate the reproductive capacity of the male. Bulls of zebu origin adapt better to high temperatures than bulls of taurine origin, which may influence scrotum temperature and seminal quality due to the imbalance of testicular thermoregulation. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between bioclimatic variables, the temperature of body and scrotal areas, assessed with infrared thermography, and the quality of fresh and post-thawed semen in zebu Nelore bulls (Bos taurus indicus) and Girolando bulls (Bos taurus taurus x Bos taurus indicus). Bulls were kept in pickets with access to water, mineral mix and a diet supplemented with concentrate. Infrared thermographs of the scrotum, orbital globe and muzzle were performed twice a week with a Flir E40 thermal imager. For scrotal thermograms, we analyzed the temperatures of the spermatic cord, proximal and distal portion of the testes and tail of the epididymis using the Flir Tools software. Samples were collected using an artificial vagina and the ejaculates were processed and frozen in liquid nitrogen until further analyses. Data were analyzed with the Tukey test or the Kruskall-Wallis test, depending on their normal distribution. Our results showed differences (p < 0.05) between the two breeds regarding the temperature in the ocular globe, spermatic cord and proximal portion of the scrotum. Nelore bulls presented lower temperature in the body and in certain regions of the scrotum compared to Girolando bulls. Seminal characteristics varied between breeds, with the Nelore breed presenting better semen. Positive correlations were observed between minor sperm defects and ventral regions of the testes and tails of the epididymis in Girolando bulls. Nelore bulls were less influenced by climatic variables and presented lower temperature in skin surface areas in the infrared thermography examination compared to Girolando bulls. Nelore bulls presented superior semen quality in both fresh and thawed samples than Girolando bulls.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35221/26397,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Physicochemical and sensory properties of papaya fruits of elite lines and hybrids,"This study aimed to evaluate papaya elite lines and hybrids as to fruit physicochemical and sensory characteristics, thus identifying the most promising ones for the market. Fruits from improved genotypes of the Solo group (CMF H10.60, CMF L78, and UC 14) and Formosa group (CMF L10, UC 10, and UC 12) were evaluated, and the commercial cultivars Golden and Tainung nº 1 were used as controls. The following physical and physicochemical evaluations were performed: fruit length and diameter, fruit inner cavity diameter, fruit weight, fruit and pulp firmness, soluble solids, pH, titratable acidity, Ratio (soluble solids and titratable acidit relation), and firmness of peeled and unpeeled ripe fruits. Sensory tests were performed with 50 papaya consumers. In general, the improved genotypes of the Solo and Formosa groups showed similar physical and physicochemical characteristics to the Golden and Tainung n° 1 controls. The CMF L78 line of the Solo group and the UC10 hybrid of the Formosa group showed similar fruit firmness and ratio characteristics compared to both commercial cultivars. The three new genotypes in the Solo group showed superior sensory characteristics to the commercial cultivar Golden. The internal preference mapping of this group revealed a higher preference for the genotypes UC 14 and CMF L78, for having fruits with more intense color, stronger flavor, and firmer texture than the others. In the Formosa group, the UC 10 genotype outperformed the cultivar Tainung nº 1, with a global acceptance percentage of 96.15%, due to a more intense aroma, color, and flavor. The CMF L78 line of the Solo group and the UC 10 hybrid of the Formosa group have excellent physicochemical and sensory characteristics and are therefore promising alternatives to replace both commercial cultivars (Golden and Tainung nº 1).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36376/26396,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This municipality has a persistent water deficit, with the need to develop irrigated agriculture with efficient water use and rational management of irrigation. The objective of this study was to evaluate estimation methods of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for different climate conditions of Mossoró, comparing them with the standard Penman-Monteith-FAO 56 method. A daily data series of two distinct years, a rainy (2011) and a dry year (2012), was used. The data were obtained from the weather station of the Federal Rural University of the Semi-Arid Region (UFERSA). An analysis was performed to identify methods that best fit those of Penman-Monteith-FAO 56, and for this, ten methods were evaluated using statistical indices. The Penman-Original, Radiation-Temperature, and Hargreaves-Original methods stood out and satisfactorily met ETo estimation for the rainy season, while the Jensen-Haise, Radiation-Temperature, and Hargreaves-Original methods achieved satisfactory performance for the dry season. The Hargreaves-Samani method did not demonstrate viability in the use of ETo estimation, as it was the worst method in both studied periods and is not recommended for irrigation management.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37209/26442,E-ISSN 1679-0359

For this, 476 cows from 46 farms were sampled and evaluated serologically. The seroprevalence in herds and cattle was, respectively, for BTV 100% and 52.0%, for BoHV-1 95.7% and 48.6%, for BVDV 78.3% and 46.1%, for Leptospira spp. 76.1% and 29.1%, and for B. abortus was 0% in herd and cattle. More than 65% of the herds was simultaneously seropositive for BTV, BoHV-1, BVDV and Leptospira spp. Seropositivity for BoHV-1, Leptospira spp. serovar Autumnalis and serovar Hardjoprajitno were associated with abortion, whereas seropositivity for BVDV was associated with BoHV-1. Moreover, association among seropositivity for BVDV, BoHV-1 and Leptospira spp. was also observed. In conclusion, BTV, BoHV-1, BVDV and Leptospira spp. are highly seroprevalent and occurred simultaneously in cattle from family farms in Minas Gerais, indicating the need for the implementation of control measures to avoid economic losses related to these diseases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35225/26398,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Yield and technological performance of sugarcane cultivars grown under Af climate conditions,"Sugarcane crops are grown in almost all regions of Brazil, in various types of soil and under the influence of different climate conditions, which results in diverse production environments as climate factors directly influence the yield and technological quality of a sugarcane crop. The present study evaluated the agronomic and technological characteristics of sugarcane cultivars grown in Af climate conditions. The agronomic traits (natural matter production and the number, length, and diameter of stalks) and technological attributes (Brix, purity, Pol, reducing sugars, total reducing sugars, moisture, and fiber content) of three sugarcane cultivars, IACSP93-6006, RB83-5486, and SP79-1011, were determined in a three-year experiment with a randomized block design using four blocks and two repetitions per block. The cultivars IACSP93-6006 and SP79-1011 exhibited superior agronomic traits compared to RB83-5486, showing better adaptation to the soil and climate conditions of the study area. However, the technological attributes, which were below the minimum standard levels required by the sugar and ethanol industry, were not statistically different among the studied cultivars. The abundant rainfall and high temperatures, characteristics of an Af climate, were not favorable for sucrose accumulation in the IACSP93-6006, RB83-5486, and SP79-1011 cultivars. Therefore, despite the high yield, sugarcane intended for industrial purposes should not be grown under Af climate conditions, owing to the insufficient technological parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36377/26391,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Alleviation of aluminum and cadmium toxicity by biochar and its potential toxicity to sorghum,"Biochar has been used as an alternative in organic wastes management and to alleviate trace elements toxicity. The aim of this research was to use a rapid and simple test to detect the potential toxic effects of biochar and its ability to alleviate aluminum and cadmium toxicity to seeds and seedlings of Sorghum bicolor L. Two experiments were carried out in Petri dishes with two different biochars where sorghum seeds were exposed to aluminum (experiment 1) and cadmium (experiment 2) solutions. The experimental designs were completely randomized, with five doses of aluminum or cadmium in aqueous solution (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mmol/L of Al or Cd), combined with or without the addition of 0.25 g of biochar from sugarcane bagasse or from sewage sludge. Compared to treatments without biochar, in the treatments with biochar, higher seed germination rate and growth of sorghum seedlings were obtained. Moreover, the biochars were not toxic to sorghum and they decreased the toxicity of aluminum and cadmium, mainly the biochar from sewage sludge that presented higher pH and greater occurrence of functional groups in its particles.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36883/26394,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Sprouting, phenology, and maturation of the Italian grapevine ‘Fiano’ in Campo Largo, PR, Brazil","Despite the expansion of viticulture in Brazil, the lack of chilling hours is a factor that requires the use of growth inducers to promote sprouting. Erger™ is a product of low toxicity and efficient in the bud induction of apple. However, there is a lack of studies testing such a product on the grapevine. This research was carried out to evaluate the sprouting and phenological cycle of ‘Fiano’ grapevine after Erger™ and calcium nitrate application in comparison to hydrogen cyanamide, as well as characterizing its production in Brazil. The experiment was carried out in Campo Largo, PR, under a trellis system, with plants spaced at 1.25 × 2.7 meters. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with four replications and three plants per plot. Different concentrations of Erger™ and calcium nitrate (3%, 5%, 7%, and control) were tested compared to the standard dose of Dormex™ (4%) to induce sprouting in ‘Fiano’ grapevine, while phenological aspects of this cultivar were evaluated following the BBCH scale. Soluble solids content, titratable acidity, and pH were evaluated weekly after the beginning of berry maturation. The main biometric and qualitative characteristics of bunches were evaluated at harvest. All treatments presented satisfactory sprouting rates in 2014, but a lower cold accumulation was observed in 2015, and Erger™ application significantly increased sprouting when compared to the control. Plants treated with Erger™ had a delay in sprouting in the two years of study, requiring more time to reach a satisfactory percentage of open buds. The anticipation of sprouting was also observed in all treatments in the second agricultural season due to higher temperatures in relation to the previous year when the occurrence of low temperatures led to a longer time to start bud opening, which was related to ecodormancy. The cultivar Fiano is productive and adapted to the conditions of Campo Largo, PR, Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36565/26478,E-ISSN 1679-0359

41,2020,Characterization of the physiological quality of soybean seeds produced in Santa Catarina State,"The soybean seeds produced in Santa Catarina have the potential for the application of new marketing strategies because they have superior quality over the minimum standards established by the Brazilian legislation. This potential was verified using time series analysis (TS). The main goal of this study was to characterize the physiological quality of soybean seeds produced in the State of Santa Catarina using data from the last five harvests in order to establish new commercialization strategies based on seed quality. Historical data for germination and vigor were obtained from the 2012/2013 to 2016/2017 harvests, with a total of 4606 lots studied. To validate the historical data, data from the 2016/2017 harvest were included. For this analysis, 100 lots of soybean seeds from the 2016/2017 harvest were collected, and laboratory tests for germination and vigor were performed. The results of the time series analysis showed that, on average, the germination rate ranged from 89 to 93%, with all values being higher than the minimum required for commercialization by the Brazilian legislation. Vigor ranged on average from 82 to 90%. Currently, there is no reference value for vigor in the Brazilian legislation for seed commercialization purposes. Of the total of lots evaluated, 1%, 2%, 21%, and 76% of seeds presented germination < 70%, 70–80%, 80–90%, and > 90%, respectively, whereas 4%, 3%, 7%, 17%, and 69% of the lots presented vigor < 70%, 70–75%, 75–80%, 80–85%, and > 85%, respectively. Considering that 76% of the lots presented germination > 90% and 69% of the lots had vigor > 85%, the lots that presented these percentages were ranked, and 64% were determined to meet high quality standards. Taking into account the 100 sampled lots from the 2016/2017 harvest, 55% presented germination > 90% and 58% had vigor > 85%. In this harvest, 41% of the lots met the standards of at least 90% germination and 85% vigor according to the ranking methodology. This study concludes that due to the stability of climatic conditions, the State of Santa Catarina produces soybean seeds with physiological quality above the minimum standards, which allow the establishment of a minimum vigor standard of 85% for the commercialization of soybean seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36092/26387,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Physicochemical characteristics of unripe and ripe banana ‘FHIA 18’ submitted to phosphorus fertilizer over three production cycles,"The banana fruits of ‘FHIA 18’ have sensory properties like the ‘Prata’ ones. However, there is no information regarding to phosphorus (P) requirement of this hybrid and its effects on postharvest quality. This study aims to evaluate the physicochemical properties of ‘FHIA 18’ banana fruits submitted to different phosphorus levels under the edaphoclimatic conditions of the municipality of São Manuel, state of São Paulo, during three successive production cycles. Therefore, different levels of Phosphorus (0 [0%], 20 [50%)], 30 [75%], 40 [100%], 50 [125%] and 60 kg ha-1 year-1 P2O5 [150%]) were applied during three production cycles. A completely randomized design and split plot structure was used, the plots consisted of six phosphorus fertilizers doses and three production cycles (2014, 2015 and 2016) in sub plots. For unripe fruits, we evaluated the contents of dry matter, starch, total sugars, reducing sugars and phosphorus. For ripe fruits, we analyzed firmness, peel colour descriptors, total titratable acidity, total soluble solids, maturity index, total sugars and reducing sugars. Results showed that P fertilizer provided an increase in P content in unripe fruits until the application of 100% of the recommended dose; besides an increase in the reducing sugar contents until the application of 61% over the first production cycle. Results also indicated that applying lower phosphorus doses ( ? 100% of the recommended dose) promoted lower total titratable acidity and higher maturity index (52-53% of recommendation) in ripe fruits. Regardless of P2O5 dose, the contents of dry matter, starch and phosphorus increased in unripe fruits from first to third crop cycle, as well as the firmness, total soluble solids contents, maturity index and sugar content in ripe fruits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35982/26386,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Analysis of different tracking intervals for Parabolic Trough Collectors for water disinfestation in agricultural applications,"The use of renewable energy is growing every year as an alternative to fossil fuel technology. Solar energy presents itself as a good alternative due to its great availability and energy potential. Solar thermal energy uses heat to warm fluids, and can also generate electricity, as well as being used in industrial processes and water desalination. The research and use of Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTCs) has been growing in recent years due to their ability to heat fluids at high temperatures in a relatively small area. In this work, two small PTCs were manufactured and tests were performed to improve the arrangements in order to increase the absorbed energy to reach temperature values for water disinfestation, aiming at the control of phytopathogens to control soil pathogens in small and medium farms. To control the automatic tracker, a low-cost system with Arduino, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and step motors was used. The tracking times intervals analyzed were 1, 5 and 15 minutes. For the 1-minute tracking interval, the PTCs presented a thermal efficiency of 25.87%, with temperatures between 45 and 70 °C and an average of 63.73 °C. For the 5-minute tracking interval, the thermal efficiency was 18.48%, reaching temperatures between 41 and 68 °C and an average of 57.9 °C. For the 15-minute tracking interval, the PTCs presented a thermal efficiency of 14.80%, with temperatures between 39 and 62 °C and an average of 51.88 °C. The results showed that the tracking intervals of 1 and 5 minutes present more values between the lethal temperature range of 45 and 60 °C for phytopathogens. For agricultural application, the usage of a tracking interval of 5 minutes could be a good option for reducing the waste of system energy compared to the interval of 1 minute.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35271/26385,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Blood typing and haematological analysis of domestic feline donors,"Blood typing is critical to avoid adverse reactions to transfusions. Felines have three blood-types: A, B, and AB and have natural alloantibodies the opposite blood type, in addition to the Mik type described recently. The presence of alloantibodies is important in the selection of blood donors in order to minimize the occurrence of transfusion reactions, and blood typing is essential in this context. This study aimed to identify blood types and perform a haematological analysis of feline blood donor candidates. Sixty clinically healthy felines of different races, weighing more than four kilograms, and ranging from one to eight years old, were evaluated. After clinical evaluation, blood samples were collected for hemogram and blood typing with the LabTest A+B® immunochromatographic test. All cats had a haematocrit level within normal range (mean: 34.12%), six (10%) presented with leucocytosis and 24 (40%) with thrombocytopenia, reinforcing the importance of haematological monitoring of blood donor animals. Regarding blood typing, all domestic felines selected as blood donors had type A blood.

The aprX gene was distributed proportionally between P. putida (68%) and P. fluorescens (75%), but it was not associated with low or high proteolytic potential in both species. P. putida (16) and P. fluorescens (14) isolates with no aprX gene identified also had proteolytic potential. Considering the synthesis of proteases other than AprX by the isolates under study, we concluded that P. fluorescens and P. putida represented 62.4% of the Pseudomonas genus, with high probability of having the aprX gene and proteolytic potential. However, there was no association between the deteriorating potential with the presence of the aprX gene.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37123/27361,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Ammonia volatilization losses from urea coated with copper, boron, and selenium","Urea coated with copper and boron may be a vehicle for selenium fertilization in grazing systems to improve both forage and animal productivity, and consequently, the nutritional quality of milk and meat. Urea is the most often used form of N fertilizer in Brazil; however, it can experience high losses by volatilization, primarily in pastures with high amounts of senescent biomass. The goal of this study was to evaluate losses by ammonia volatilization from urea coated with Cu, B, and Se. The fertilizer was applied to the soil surface under forage straw residues in cylindric glass chambers under controlled laboratory conditions. The treatments were urea (UR), urea coated with boric acid and copper sulfate (UBC), urea coated with boric acid, copper sulfate, and selenium (UBCS), and ammonium sulfate (AS). Measurements were recorded at regular intervals after fertilizer application for 27 days. High losses occurred from ammonia volatilization of amidic-N sources in the initial days after fertilizer application. The total loss of N by ammonia volatilization according to fertilizer treatment was UR > UBC = UBCS > AS. Urea lost by ammonia volatilization accounted for up to 50% of the N applied, although losses from coated urea treatments UBC and UBCS were 11.45% lower than that of urea. The Cu and B in the coated urea reduced losses by ammonia volatilization and the inclusion of Se had no effect. It is suggested that Se may be added to the Cu and B coating of urea to reduce ammonia volatilization.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36835/27360,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Effects of slow-release urea on in vitro rumen fermentation parameters, growth performance, nutrient digestibility and serum metabolites of beef cattle","Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of slow-release urea (SRU) on in vitro rumen fermentation parameters, growth performances, nutrient digestibility, and serum metabolites of beef cattle. The single factor design was applied in both experiments. Three diets with different nitrogen sources including soybean meal (Control group), slow-release urea (SRU group), and common urea (Urea group) was designed (concentrate to forage ratio was 4:6). The diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, 75% of the soybean meal in the control diet was replaced by 1.41% SRU and 1.15% urea in SRU group and Urea group, respectively. In experiment 1, five healthy Jinjiang cattle (average body weight (BW) was 380 ± 17.1 kg) with permanent rumen fistulas were used in in vitro ruminal fermentation experiment. The results showed that supplementing SRU increased the dry matter degradation rate (DMD), digestible organic matter (DOM) and propionic acid concentration in cultivated fluid, and SRU supplementation decreased pH, NH3-N, total volatile fatty acid (TVFA), acetic acid, butyric acid concentration and microbial growth efficiency (MOEFF) in cultivated fluid. In experiment 2, eighteen Simmental crossbred cattle BW= 315 ± 5.2 kg) were stratified by BW and then assigned to the three groups to have equal BW among groups. The results showed that supplementing SRU reduced the average dry matter intake (ADMI), apparent digestibility of ether extract (EE), the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), the levels of IgG and IgA, and the production of thiiodothronine (T3) in serum, SRU supplementation increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter and organic matter (OM) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration in serum. These results indicated that some soybean meal could be replaced by SRU and urea in the production of beef cattle. In addition, compared with urea, SRU had a good sustained-release effect. The replacement of some soybean meal by SRU in the diet had no adverse impact on rumen fermentation, growth performance, and serum metabolites of beef cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38591/27393,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Best linear model to explain variability in the growth in Blanco Orejinegro cattle and effect of the serological status for bovine viral diarrhea and bovine leukosis,"The cattle breed Blanco Orejinegro (BON) is an important animal genetic resource in Colombia that needs to be studied to identify its productive benefits for Colombian livestock. The aim of this work was to establish the best linear model that explains the variability for birth weight, weaning weight and yearling weight, and estimate the effect of the serological status for Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) and Bovine Leukosis (BL) in BON cattle in Colombia. The information on animal weighings belonging to 14 BON cattle herds, was collected and cleansed. Using the least squares method, 12 linear models were evaluated including as fixed effects, factors such as herd, sex, weighing month, birth order, season (rainy or dry), birth year, and contemporary group (formed by the concatenation of the factors herd, sex, and birth year). The weighing age was included as a covariate for weaning and yearling weights. For the selection of a model that best describes each parameter, the criteria for choosing models, such as Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information criterion (BIC), coefficient of determination (R2), and the sum of squares of the error (SSE), were considered. The model that included the contemporary group showed the best fit, being also the best to describe the three parameters evaluated, since, of the four criteria considered for its evaluation, AIC and SSE showed the lowest values and the highest R2. With this model, weight predictions with higher precision were able to be performed. Employing indirect ELISA screening tests of blood plasma, the serological status of each animal was estimated for BVD and BL viral infections. The serological status of these two viral infections was included in the best-fit model. There was no significant effect of the serological status on the parameters evaluated, so there are indications that animals that came in contact with the virus were not affected during growth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38568/27382,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,New model of evaluation of sunflower and corn silages by the in vitro gas production technique,"This study aimed to propose a model called Two-compartment Logistic-von Bertalanffy (LVB) and to identify among the proposed and Two-compartment Logistic (TL) models the one that has the best goodness of fit to the kinetic curve of cumulative gas production (CGP) of sunflower and corn silages alone and combined using the in vitro semi-automated gas production technique. A random block split-plot experimental design was employed in which the inoculums were the blocks, the incubation times were the split-plots, and the experimental diets were: CS - corn silage, SS - sunflower silage (as single roughage), and their mixtures, i.e., 340SS (660 g kg-1 corn silage and 340 g kg-1 sunflower silage) and 660SS (340 g kg-1 corn silage and 660 g kg-1 sunflower silage). The parameters were estimated by the least squares method using the iterative Gauss-Newton process in the software R version 3.4.1. The criteria adopted were: adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj.), residual mean squares (RMS), mean absolute deviation (MAD), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and relative efficiency (RE). The TL model had higher R2adj. values compared to LVB, however, such difference may be considered negligible. The LVB model had RE above one, which indicates it is superior to the TL model, in addition to the lowest RMS, MAD, AIC, and BIC values, The Two-compartment Logistic-von Bertalanffy model had the best fit to describe the CGP over time according to the methodology and conditions of the present study.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37644/27355,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Nutritional value of pre-dried banana tree pseudostem ammoniated with protected urea,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition, pH and rumen degradability of banana tree pseudostems pre-dried and ammoniated with different doses of urea (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% in natural matter). The experiment consisted of five treatments (doses of urea) with six replications, following a completely randomized design. There was a linear increase in the pH (P < 0.01) of the banana tree pseudostems pre dried with the inclusion of urea. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in dry matter, ash, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, non-fibrous carbohydrates and total digestible nutrients; the averages were 31.58, 18.82, 46.43, 9.30, 11.87 and 42.52%, respectively. The inclusion of 2% urea increased the crude protein content (P < 0.01) by 42.75%, the soluble fraction ""a"" by 31.82%, and the potential and effective degradability of dry matter by 15.49% compared to that of the control group (without urea). The potentially degradable fraction, time of colonization and ruminal repletion of the neutral detergent fiber of the pre-dried banana tree pseudostems were not altered with the inclusion of urea (P > 0.05). The ammonization of the pre-dried banana tree pseudostems with 2% of urea improved the chemical composition and rumen degradability of the dry matter.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37557/27353,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Ingestive diurnal behaviour of grazing beef cattle,"Three experiments were conducted with the objective of evaluating the effects of supplementation (concentrate or mineral supplementation), supplementation strategy (continuous or strategic supplementation) and gender class on the ingestive and diurnal behaviour of grazing beef cattle. To evaluate the effect of the supplementation (Experiment 1) and the gender class (Experiment 3) on their diurnal behaviour, behaviour visualisations were performed by two people at observation stations outside the picket area with the aid of binoculars. The animal behaviour was classified as: supplement intake, grazing, water intake, standing ruminating, standing idle, lying ruminating, lying idle and walking. To evaluate the effect of the supplementation strategy on the ingestive behaviour of the supplement (Experiment 2), refusals of the supplement were weighed for six consecutive days at different times (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 480 and 1,440 minutes) after the concentrate was supplied. The intake of concentrate per animal, at each observation time, was calculated by subtracting the weight of the scraps at that time from the total weight of the batch of supplement provided on the day, and dividing the result by the number of animals in each batch. Finally, a logistic model was adjusted for each treatment. A 10% significance level was adopted for all statistical procedures. Concentrate supplementation reduced the time that the animals spent grazing. The continuous supplementation strategy affected the uniformity of the supplement intake speed, without affecting the average speed or the total supplement intake. The gender class of the animals also influenced their diurnal behaviour, castrated males spent more time lying, compared to females. The specificities of cattle behaviour should be considered when delineating the supplementation of grazing cattle, since the type of supplement, previous supplementation and gender class interfere with their behaviour.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37186/27352,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Longitudinal retrospective study on the effect of season on milk production and composition in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","This longitudinal retrospective study evaluated production and composition of milk from dairy cows according to season on a rural property in Palmeira das Missões, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, between January 2009 and December 2016. Milk yield per hectare per month was the primary variable measured, along with chemical composition (total dry extract, defatted dry extract, fat, protein, and lactose), somatic cell count, and total bacterial count of milk. Production in summer (513.53 kg/ha/month) did not differ (p > 0.05) from that in fall (504.69 kg/ha/month) or spring (564.63 kg/ha/month), but production in winter (639.20 kg/ha/month) was significantly higher than in summer (p < 0.0057). The real price of milk did not differ (p > 0.05) among seasons. The total dry extract content differed (p < 0.0059) between seasons. However, the cooler fall and winter seasons favored the production of total solids. The defatted dry extract content was higher (p < 0.0001) in winter (8.65%), compared to the other seasons of the year. Fat content did not differ (p > 0.05) among seasons. Protein content differed (p < 0.0200) between summer (3.01%) and winter (3.16%), but both seasons did not differ (p > 0.05) from fall (3.13%) or spring (3.05%). Winter lactose levels (4.52%) were higher (p < 0.0011) than during other seasons. The somatic cell count did not differ (p > 0.05) among seasons, demonstrating that the evaluated herd possesses standard mammary gland health. The total bacterial count did not differ (p > 0.05) among the seasons, demonstrating that the hygiene of the facilities remains constant. As expected, the temperature and humidity index varied (p < 0.0001) with the seasons, and the deleterious effects were more pronounced in summer and spring, as they are the hottest seasons in humid subtropical environments. The results emphasize that the organized management of milk production reduces the variation in milk composition, making it easier to maintain a consistent high milk quality and also generating extra revenue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37641/27354,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Ruminal fermentation and degradation, kinetic flow of digesta and milk fatty acid composition of cows fed sugarcane silage-based diets supplemented with whole cottonseed","The aim of this study was to evaluate the ruminal fermentation and degradation parameters, the kinetic flow of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract, and the milk fatty acid (FA) profile in Holstein x Gyr cows fed 59% sugarcane silage-based diets with 0% (control), 5%, 10% and 15% whole cottonseed (WCS) on a dry matter (DM) basis. Four rumen-cannulated cows with an average milk yield of 14.4±3.3 kg day-1 and 85±25 days in milk were allocated in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. There was no effect of dietary WCS levels on the intake of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and nonfibrous carbohydrates, but there was a linear increase in the intake of ether extract (EE). There was no treatment effect on the apparent digestibility of DM, OM, CP, EE and NDF or on the ruminal degradability parameters for DM and NDF of sugarcane silage. Also, no treatment effects were observed on rumen pH, ruminal and postruminal particulate passage rates or on the rate of passage of the fluids in the rumen. WCS promoted linear reductions in the milk fat contents of lauric, myristic and palmitic acids and linear increases in the milk fat contents of stearic, oleic, trans-10 C18:1 and elaidic acids. The milk fat contents of vaccenic, rumenic, linoleic and ?-linolenic acids were unaffected by WCS supplementation. The inclusion of up to 15% WCS in sugarcane silage-based diets did not alter the digestibility of nutrients, the rumen degradability of the fiber, or the kinetic flow of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract of Holstein x Gyr cows but improved the nutritional quality of milk fat through an increase in the content of oleic acid, which is beneficial to human health, and decreased levels of hypercholesterolemic lauric, myristic and palmitic acids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37097/27351,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Essential oils and prebiotic on broiler diets as feed additives,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a combination of essential oils, prebiotics and antibiotics on broiler production. The treatments consisted of a normal diet meeting the nutritional requirements, and diets with a 5% reduction of nutritional requirements, supplemented or not with antibiotics (En+Sal) (10 g ton-1 enramycin and 125 g ton-1 salinomycin) or a blend of essential oils (EOFOS) (oregano, anise and lemon) plus fructooligosaccharides (125 g ton-1). A total of 1,152 male one-day-old broilers were randomized by weight and distributed into a 2*3 factorial design, consisting of six treatments with each treatment containing eight replicates of 24 birds per experimental unit. The Student-Newman-Keuls test was performed at 5% probability. Broiler performance was evaluated at 10, 21 and 42 days, intestinal morphometry was evaluated at 21 days, microbiological cecum counts at 33 days, blood parameters at 35 days and carcass and cuts yield at 42 days of age. Broilers fed reduced diets had a reduction in performance (P < 0.05). There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between diet type and prebiotics for jejunum villus height and villus height:crypt depth ratios for all intestinal segments. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of growth promoters and diet type on the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations within the gastrointestinal tract. There were no differences for duodenum or ileum villus heights (P > 0.05). Broilers fed EOFOS showed higher villus height in the jejunum at 21 days. There were no effects on blood parameters of different diets and growth promoters (P > 0.05), nor on carcass and cuts yield, abdominal fat and relative liver weight (P > 0.05). Broilers receiving the normal diet with EOFOS showed higher villus height in the jejunum at 21 days when compared to the normal diet with antibiotics and the normal diet without growth promoters. However, there were no effects of growth promoters and diet type on broiler performance at 42 days.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36991/27350,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Infrared thermography and Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate the effects of scrotal insulation on testicular blood flow dynamics in bulls,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of the scrotal temperature, sperm quality and testicular blood flow by using infrared thermography and Doppler ultrasonography in bulls submitted to scrotal insulation. Braford bulls (n = 8) at 18 months of age, were assigned into the following groups: insulated for 72 h (G 72; n = 2), 96 h (G 96, n = 2), 120 h (G 120, n = 2), and control animals (CON; n = 2) that remained without insulation. Infrared thermography and Doppler ultrasonography parameters were measured at four different time points: immediately after the scrotal insulation (M0), within 10 min (M10), 30 min (M30) and 60 min (M60) after scrotal insulation. The sperm quality was evaluated weekly (S1/S12). The data were analyzed by ANOVA, t-test (paired) and Pearson's correlation with a significance level of 5%. None of the observed variables were different between the insulated groups (P > 0.05). Insulated animals showed higher scrotal temperature in M0 compared to that in the M10, M30 and M60 periods (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the pulsatility and resistive indexes after scrotal insulation. However, blood flow velocity was higher in M10 compared to that in the M0, M30 and M60 periods (P < 0.05). The sperm quality was higher (P < 0.05) in all twelve collections from the control group compared with the insulated groups. Scrotal insulation resulted in changes in the sperm quality, scrotal temperature and testicular blood flow velocity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37362/27347,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,First molecular detection of Eimeria spp. in eared doves (Zenaida auriculata) from Brazil,"The aim of the present study was to detect Eimeria spp. in eared doves (Zenaida auriculata) from Brazil. Two hundred and fourteen birds were trap-capture in different regions of Londrina city, Paraná state, Southern Brazil. Fecal samples were collected, and DNA extraction was performed. A nested PCR based on the subunit I of the cytochrome c oxidase gene of the Eimeria mitochondrial genome was used to detect the DNA presence of this coccidian in eared dove feces. From 214 birds, 171 (79.9%) were positive for Eimeria spp. There was significantly difference of positivity between the site of capture. When analyzing the genders, the numbers of positive males were 84/103 (81.5%) and females 87/111 (78.4%). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study with molecular prevalence of Eimeria sp. in Z. auriculata.

41,2020,"Spatial and temporal trend analysis of bovine brucellosis in Brazil, 2014 to 2018","Bovine brucellosis, a zoonotic disease endemic to Brazil, is a serious public health problem. It is a notifiable disease that, like tuberculosis, is regulated through a national control and eradication program. The epidemiological status of bovine brucellosis must be characterized in order to direct measures aimed at controlling the disease. This study focused on analyzing the spatial and temporal distribution of bovine brucellosis in Brazil. An ecological and time series study was conducted based on secondary data reported by the National Animal Health Information System for cases of bovine brucellosis diagnosed in Brazil (2014 - 2018). The gross and average incidence rate of brucellosis was estimated per state. Joinpoint regression was applied to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) in incidence and to identify states with significant trend changes. Spatial analysis of animals with brucellosis was performed using Kernel density estimation. A total of 19,631 animals with bovine brucellosis were confirmed, and the average incidence rate varied from 0.03 to 33.93/100,000 cattle in Brazil. The highest density of positive animals was found in the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná, which can be considered areas of greater transmission of Brucella abortus. Reductions in gross incidence rates were observed in Paraná (APC: -13.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -20.3 – -5.4; p=0.01), Rondônia (APC: -44.7; 95%CI: -62.0 - -19.4; p=0.01), Mato Grosso do Sul (APC: -59.0; 95%CI: -77.7 - -24.5; p=0.01), Acre (APC: -40.0; 95%CI: -50.0 - -28.0; p=0.00), and Ceará (APC: -37.9; 95%CI: -50.9 - -21.4; p=0.00). The incidence rate significantly increased in Tocantins (APC: 122.1; 95%CI: 4.5 - 372.2; p=0.04). The findings of this study will be helpful in guiding surveillance and prevention measures aimed at reducing the incidence of bovine brucellosis in Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37828/27384,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Production and nutritional quality of ryegrass forage grown in different population stands under successive cuts,"The Brazilian livestock activity is undergoing constant evolution, and aiming at its maximum efficiency, it is necessary to have available to the animals food in quantity and quality all the year. To this end, the cultivation of winter forage is carried out. The present study aimed to evaluate the productive and qualitative agronomic traits of ryegrass forage. The experiment was a randomized block design in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement consisting of six treatments, three plant stands (525, 1050 and 2095 plants m-2) associated with two successive cutting times (vegetative and full vegetative), and four repetitions. There was no interaction between population stand and cutting times for the variables studied. The stand of 525 plants m-2 had a higher participation of green leaves (50.52 %), higher digestibility of the whole plant dry matter (84.81 %) compared to the stands of 1.050 and 2.095 plants m-2, and dry biomass production per unit area equivalent to the others (6087, 7243 and 6989 kg ha-1, respectively). The first harvest season presented higher participation of green leaves and better leaf/stem ratio, 58.62 % and 3.41 % respectively, as well as higher digestibility of green leaves (77.26 %) and stem (80.82 %).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36869/27349,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Influence of glycerol addition on the quality of cat epididymal sperm during the freeze-thaw process,"Cryopreservation of epididymal sperm is a useful tool for preserving the genetic potential of valuable animal specimens. The domestic cat is used as a model to study and develop cryogenics for other felines. However, regulation of the entire cryopreservation process is essential for the success of this biotechnology. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the effects of glycerol equilibration time and freeze-thaw stages on the quality of epididymal sperm obtained from domestic cats. Epididymal sperm were recovered with TRIS and immediately evaluated for total motility (TM), vigor, viability, membrane functionality (HOST), and morphology. Then, TRIS-20% egg yolk was added to the samples, which were equally divided into two 1.5 mL tubes and refrigerated at 4 ºC for 1 hour. Subsequently, glycerol was added at a final concentration of 5%. The samples were incubated with glycerol (equilibration time) for either 5 or 10 minutes (groups G5 and G10, respectively) and then frozen. Thawing occurred at 37 ºC for 30 seconds. The samples were evaluated at all stages. A reduction in TM was observed only after thawing; however, it was higher in G5 (39.00 ± 4.07%) than in G10 (18.50 ± 4.54%). Vigor declined in both groups after thawing; however, they did not differ from each other. Sperm viability was maintained in G5 after glycerolization (53.60 ± 2.59%); in G10, sperm viability decreased in the glycerolized sample (48.80 ± 2.93%) when compared to that in the fresh sample (59.90 ± 1.74%). Post-thaw viability of G5 (33.80 ± 1.89%) was higher than that of G10 (18.80 ± 3.01%). In the HOST, a decrease in viability was only observed after thawing, with no difference between the groups (41.50 ± 2.84% for G5 and 40.20 ± 3.49% for G10). With regard to sperm morphology, normal sperm decreased while sperm with post-thaw secondary defects increased in both groups. In conclusion, a shorter equilibration time for glycerolization preserves epididymal sperm quality better and the freeze-thaw process is the most critical stage of thawing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36574/27344,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Medium and time conservation affect follicular morphology and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity of bovine preantral follicles during storage at 4ºC,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphology and superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity of bovine preantral follicles (PFs) preserved in TCM 199, saline solution or PBS at different conservation periods. Cow ovaries (n=6) were divided into 7 fragments. One small piece of each ovarian fragment was randomly removed to evaluate SOD activity, while the remainder was immediately fixed for morphological evaluation as a control group. The other 6 fragments were randomly distributed in tubes containing TCM 199, saline solution, or PBS and maintained at 4ºC for 6 or 24 h. For histological evaluation, the fragments were fixed in Carnoy and stained with PAS-hematoxylin, following being classified PFs in relation to their follicular morphology in normal or degenerated. Determination of SOD activity was based on the ability to inhibit autoxidation of adrenaline in adrenochrome. Evaluation of follicular morphology showed that follicles preserved in TCM 199 for 6 h did not differ from the control (P > 0.05). In contrast, preservation in saline solution and PBS for 6 or 24 h and TCM 199 for 24 h decreased normal PFs compared to the control (P < 0.05). SOD showed a lower activity in ovarian cortical tissue kept in TCM 199 for 6 h and saline solution for 24 h than in the other groups. Our study shows that incubation using TCM 199 at 4°C for 6 h can be used to efficiently conserve female bovine PFs in situ.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36344/27426,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Influence of male on estrus behavior, estradiol and progesterone release and puberty onset on prepubertal Saanen goats","The present study investigated the male effect on the estrus behaviors, estradiol and progesterone release in prepubertal Saanen goats. Twenty-nine female Saanen goats at 135 ± 10 days old with body weight of 22.8 ± 3.3 Kg were randomly assigned to three treatments: exposure to sexually active male (male treatment), exposure to androgenized females (androgenized female treatment), and prepubertal goats isolated from active male and androgenized females (control treatment). Sexual behaviors associated with estrus were recorded daily, and blood samples were taken weekly to determine estradiol and progesterone concentrations over 24 weeks. The experimental goats subjected to male or androgenized female had significantly higher frequency of estrus (mount acceptance) (P ? 0,02), progesterone (P ? 0,01), and estradiol (P ? 0,01) release than the control goats. Furthermore, goats exposed to a male showed estrus behavior two weeks earlier and maintained this estrus behavior for three weeks more than goats of both female and control treatments. Estrus was observed in 70 % of goats in male and female treatments during the breeding season versus 44 % of the control goats. Finally, significantly more goats subjected to male treatment (60 % of goats) showed progesterone concentrations higher than 1 ng mL-1 (which indicates the presence of a functional corpus luteum) compared to the female and control treatment (40 and 22 % of goats, respectively). These results shows that male treatment significantly increased the number of females showing estrus behavior, estradiol and progesterone release, and the number of animals with a functional corpus luteum, anticipating puberty for experimental goats, suggesting that the male effect could be used to anticipate the onset of puberty in goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36692/27345,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Use of computed radiology as a screening test for the identification of congenital heart disease in dogs,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic radiology as a screening test for congenital heart diseases in dogs, to identify the main contributions and limitations of this modality, and to verify the reproducibility of the evaluations by three observers with different levels of training. An interobserver, observational, retrospective and prospective study was carried out, including ninety dogs: thirty healthy animals, thirty with acquired heart diseases and thirty with congenital heart diseases, which all had thoracic radiographs and a confirmed echocardiographic diagnosis. The cases were separated and randomized by a mediator who did not participate in the reading of the radiographic examinations, and no evaluator had access to the patients' data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of each observer were calculated in relation to the correct classification of dogs to groups of normal or acquired and congenital heart diseases, as well as identification of enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and large vessels of dogs with congenital heart diseases. Finally, the Kappa coefficient was obtained between the observers to verify the reproducibility of the radiological evaluations performed. In general, sensitivity, PPV and accuracy were unsatisfactory ( 70%), and the agreement ranged from poor to reasonable (between 0 and 0.39). Although greater accuracy was achieved in the differentiation of healthy dogs from those with acquired and congenital heart diseases by thoracic radiography, when compared to the other studies, the modality was able only to identify healthy patients, and could not differentiate the individuals with different forms of heart disease or define the cardiac malformations. In addition, there was low reproducibility between observers, therefore, this technique should not be used as a sole screening method in dogs with suspected congenital heart diseases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35985/27341,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Evaluation of performances of different types of spray nozzles in site-specific pesticide spraying,"In recent years, site-specific spraying methods, which are capable of combining the image processing technologies with electronic and information technologies, have been started to be used in the weed control and target-oriented spraying. In this study, in addition to the site-specific spraying in laboratory conditions; a mobile spraying system, which can also perform broadcast application as a reference method, was set up. The spraying performance of the mobile system was tested for three different nozzle types (standard flat fan nozzle, cone nozzle, air induction nozzle) and at speeds of 0.48, 0.60, 0.72 and 0.84 km h-1. The mobile system was operated as both broadcast and site-specific for each nozzle type and travel speed. Three artificial weed samples were used at 75 cm intervals as sampling surfaces on the movement of the mobile system in the spraying operations; filter papers (FP) and water-sensitive papers (WSP) were placed behind them on the bars. While deposition values were measured with the filter papers, water-sensitive papers were used to measure the coverage rates. The spray distribution of the site-specific method in comparison with the reference method was investigated. According to the results, site-specific spraying applications did not cause any negative impact on depositions and coverage rates. The nearest results compared with the broadcast spraying were obtained with the air induction nozzle type at a speed of 0.48 km h-1 with a 60.5% deposition amount and 95.9% coverage rate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38593/27340,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Overcoming dormancy in Bauhinia scandens seeds,"Bauhinia scandens, an ornamental climbing vine, recently introduced in Brazil, in 2006 which has been gaining prominence due to its anti-tumor medicinal properties. A common feature amongst species of the Fabaceae family is dormancy due to the impermeability of the integument of the seed to water. The demand for seedlings of this species makes it necessary to elucidate the germination process and initial seedling growth. The objective of this study was to determine a method to overcome dormancy, thereby promoting seed germination and initial growth of B. scandens seedlings. The seeds were subjected to one of four treatments, besides the control: mechanical scarification, immersion in water (26 °C for 24 hours), immersion in hot water (86 °C for 24 hours, then 26 °C) and immersion in H2SO4 (95%) for 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The seeds were evaluated for water content, germination (normal, abnormal seedlings, dormant and dead seeds), first count, mean germination time and relative frequency of germination. The seedlings were evaluated for emergence in sand, first count, emergence speed index, length and dry matter mass. B. scandens seeds should be immersed in H2SO4 for 45 and 60 minutes before sowing to overcome dormancy, in order to promote and standardize seed germination and enhance initial growth of the seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37419/27339,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Performance of beans after inoculation with azospirillum brasilense and rhizobium tropici, and nitrogen and molybic fertilizations under amazonian conditions","Beans are nutrient-demanding plants, with a high demand for nitrogen (N). Nitrogen biological fixation (NBF) is probably the best solution to meet this demand, especially considering losses in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Molybdenum (Mo), present in the enzymes nitrogenase and nitrate reductase, is fundamental in the metabolism of N, including NBF. This study aims to evaluate if bean seed inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense, Rhizobium tropici, and possible interactions with nitrogen topdressing and molybdenum leaf application, may affect winter bean development and yield. A randomized complete block design was used in a 4x2x2 factorial scheme. Plant population, production components, and grain yield were evaluated in two crop seasons (2017 and 2018). Seed inoculation with A. brasilense, when associated with 30 kg ha-1 N topdressing, increased plant population, pod number per plant and grain yield. Nitrogen topdressing is key to increasing winter bean productivity, regardless of inoculation or Mo foliar application.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37359/27338,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Plastochron and yield of Physalis peruviana L. grown in different environments and transplanting dates,"This study aimed to estimate plastochron, leaf area, and yield of Physalis peruviana seedlings grown in different environments and transplanted on different dates. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design, arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial scheme, namely: two cultivation environments (protected and field) and three transplanting dates (10/27/2013, 12/15/2013, and 02/11/2014). Four replicates of eight plants were used per plot, and the four central plants composed the useful area. Based on mathematical models and temperature data, plastochron was estimated for the entire crop cycle and vegetative and reproductive phases separately. Leaf area and node number were measured, and their relationship established at the end of the study. Other variables assessed were fruit number, mass, and yield per plant. Our results showed that the higher temperatures in the protected environment anticipated phenological timings. Plastochron values of 60.0 and 16.5 °C day-1 can be used during vegetative and reproductive stages, respectively. The protected environment increased vegetative growth and development, as well as yield of P. peruviana seedlings. In the Guarapuava-PR region, P. peruviana seedlings should be transplanted during the spring so that higher fruit yield and quality could be achieved.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36915/27334,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Maize hybrids contrasting for drought tolerance differ during the vegetative stage,"Maize hybrids contrasting for drought tolerance differ during the vegetative stage. Drought is the main constraint on maize production in developing nations. Differences during development between genetic materials of maize grown under water restriction suggest that the plant can be improved with a view to its adaptation. In maize, sensitivity to water stress can occur at any stage of its phenological development. However, few studies report its effects on the vegetative phase of the cycle. On this basis, this study was conducted to examine how shoot and root-system indices are expressed in cultivation under water deficit as well as determine which indicators best explain the difference between hybrids in the evaluated water regimes. Commercial seeds of hybrids BR1055 and DKB-390 (drought-tolerant) and BRS1010 (drought-sensitive) were germinated in PVC tubes (1.0 m × 0.1 m) in a randomized complete block design, in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement. The experiment was developed in a greenhouse where two water regimes were tested: no water stress and with water stress from the VE stage. The soil consisted of quartz sand mixed with a commercial fertilizer. Stem and root traits were evaluated up to the V5 growth stage. Relative chlorophyll content, leaf temperature, stem length, phenology, shoot dry biomass, root length, root dry biomass, root surface area, root volume and D95 were responsive to water deficit. The parameters that allowed the distinction between the hybrids in water the regimes were relative chlorophyll content, leaf temperature, phenology and average root diameter.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34784/27330,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Effects of green and nitrogen fertilization on the yield and yield components of irrigated winter beans,"The contribution of plant residues to the soil is an essential requirement for the success of no-tillage systems, especially in areas with a tropical climate where the organic material decomposition rate is high. The type of straw present on the soil surface can influence the culture implanted subsequently, mainly with regard to the availability of nitrogen (N). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cultural remains of maize (exclusive or intercropped with cover crops) on the development and productivity of the common bean grown in succession and fertilized with different N doses. The experimental design was a randomized block arranged in a factorial scheme (5 × 4), with four replications. The treatments consisted of combinations of cultural remains of exclusive maize, maize + Crotalaria spectabilis, maize + Cajanus cajan, maize + Canavalia ensiformis, and maize + Urochloa ruziziensis cultivated previously and of four N rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha-1) applied to bean crops. The plots consisted of seven lines of 7.5 m length with 0.45 m spacing between the lines. The evaluated parameters were: dry matter of the plant cover, dry matter of the aerial part (beans), production components, weight of 100 grains, and grain yield. The intercropping of maize and cover crops promoted an increase in dry matter over the soil, compared to the exclusive maize crop. There was an increase in the dry matter of bean plants with the increase in N rates in the two years of cultivation; regarding productivity, there was an increment only in the first year of cultivation. The maize consortium with cover plants provided adequate soil cover, but did not influence the productivity of beans cultivated in succession in the two years of cultivation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36918/27376,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Agronomic performance of grain sorghum in different spatial arrangements,"Grain sorghum has been cultivated extensively in the Central-West region of Brazil in succession with soybean, since the species tolerates the low rainfall conditions recorded during this growing season. Phytotechnological adjustments for sorghum are still necessary in order to exploit the maximum yield potential of the crop. In this context, altering the plant distribution may result in better utilization of the growing area with a consequent increase in grain yield. On this basis, field experiments were conducted with two grain sorghum hybrids, replicated in two different locations, in order to evaluate the effect of the spatial arrangement of plants on the agronomic performance of grain sorghum. The design was a randomized complete block design in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme, with five replications. The factors consisted of two row spacings (0.50 and 0.25 m) and four plant densities: 120, 180, 240, and 300 thousand plants ha-1. The sorghum hybrids used were 1G244® and 1G100®. At harvest, morphological characteristics, yield components, and grain yields were evaluated. Row spacing did not influence the characteristics evaluated except for the plant height of for both hybrids, in addition to the stem diameter, tillering, and mass of a thousand grains for 1G100®. The increase in plant density provided an increase in grain yield, being the highest number of panicles per area the most expressive component for this behavior.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34819/27331,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Nutrient support via fertigation with domestic effluent and growth of cotton,"Because of climatic problems in the Brazilian semi-arid region, it is of fundamental importance to seek a culture that considers water scarcity and available natural resources. Thus, a randomized block design, with subdivided plots and six replications, was carried out in the experimental area of the treatment and wastewater reuse station of the Milagres Settlement, Apodi, Brazil, with the objective of evaluating cultivation of herbaceous cotton (Gossipyum hirsutum) fertigated with domestic sewage treated in a semi-arid environment. Two cultivation cycles were carried out, and the cotton plants were fed with three different solutions containing treated domestic sewage (TDE) plus supply water (PSW), to supply the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) (100% PSW – control, 50% PSW + 50% TDE and 100% TDE), with and without phosphate fertilization in pre-planting. The contribution of nutrients to the soil and plant growth were analyzed. The results indicated that the wastewater presents potential fertilizer, reaching to the soil amounts of some nutrients exceeding the cotton’s needs, when 100% of the ETc was supplied via fertigation with domestic effluent, resulting in an increase in the growth rates of the plants. There was no interaction between the percentages of wastewater and phosphate fertilization in pre-planting. Phosphorus alone promoted significant variation only in the first cycle, indicating that there is a residual fertigation effect with domestic effluent on the nutrient supply.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36909/27333,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Absence of Trichinella spiralis in swine carcasses slaughtered in the midwestern Region of Paraná State, Brazil","Trichinella spiralis causes severe infections in humans, resulting in various clinical symptoms and even death, in several countries worldwide. Human trichinellosis has been reported in 55 countries, and mainly affects certain ethnic groups and tourists. It is caused by the ingestion of raw, undercooked meat or pork, or their by-products containing parasitic larvae. Infections in swine especially occur due to the parasitic contamination of food containing animal products, predation by rodents and other animals infected with T. spiralis, and due to the frequent habit of cannibalism in intensive production systems. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of T. spiralis in pig carcasses from a slaughterhouse located in the midwestern region of Paraná State, Brazil. Pools of 100 g of diaphragm, containing at least 1 g of tissue from each test animal, were collected, ground, and subjected to acid digestion with pepsin (1:10,000) and 25% hydrochloric acid. Sampling was performed in accordance to the methodology recommended by the European Union. All the 735,902 samples collected between 2010 and 2013, and in 2018, were negative for Trichinella spp. larvae. The pigs came from 483 farms from 90 municipalities from the three states of southern Brazil (Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). The absence of the parasite in different animal species, reported by surveys conducted in Brazil, could confirm the country as free from trichinellosis. Although T. spiralis is not endemic to Brazil, it is necessary to subject the meat of adult pigs slaughtered here and exported to other countries to inspections and parasitological examinations. It is therefore necessary to continually inspect pig carcasses for T. spiralis in slaughterhouses worldwide.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36814/27098,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Agricultural potential and soil use based on the pedogenetic properties of soils from the cerrado-caatinga transition,"The sustainable use of soil requires a broad knowledge of its genesis, morphology, properties, and distribution in the landscape. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the pedogenetic attributes of representative soils from the cerrado-caatinga transition of the Gurguéia river basin to indicate their agricultural potential and limitations for the implementation of agroforestry systems. National and international soil classification systems were used to define the soil classes. The limiting factors and agricultural potential were characterized following the evaluation system of the agricultural potential of Brazilian land. In general, profiles 1, 3, 5, and 6 had a low nutrient budget and a sandy to loam texture. Profiles 2, 4, and 7 showed high clay content and nutrient budget. The soil profiles were classified as Ustic Quartzipsamments, Udic Haplusterts, Xanthic Haplustox, Arenic Kanhaplustults, Typic Haplustox, and Aridic Dystrustept based on their pedogenetic characteristics. Udic Haplusterts and Arenic Kanhaplustults soils display restrictions regarding the planting of forests owing to oxygen and soil depth limitations. The other soil classes had adequate physical properties for the implementation of agricultural systems and pastures, including good drainage and medium texture; however, they had low natural fertility, and thus require technologies for soil acidity correction and fertilization. Ustic Quartzipsamments and Ustic soils require the implementation of conservation systems, such as agroforestry, to avoid degradation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36591/27332,E-ISSN 1679-0359

41,2020,Use of SPAD index in elephant grass pre-breeding,"The SPAD-502 (Soil Plant Analysis Development) chlorophyll meter is a simple diagnostic tool that instantly measures the chlorophyll content of plant leaves without damaging the leaf blade. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the SPAD index as a tool for discriminating elephant grass acessions from different morphological groups. One hundred genotypes of the elephant grass Pennisetum purpureum from the Active Germplasm Bank at Embrapa Dairy Cattle, Minas Gerais, Brazil were evaluated. Following uniform cutting, six SPAD readings were taken from each accession every 60 days. Measurements were taken for two years. The experimental design was a 10 × 10 simple lattice with two replications. Joint deviance analysis for six SPAD measurements revealed great genetic variability between genotypes. SPAD values of Cameroon and Napier accessions were, on average, significantly different. The SPAD index was effective in detecting genetic variability between elephant grass acessions.

41,2020,"Morphological and morphometric characteristics, drying rate, and chemical composition of forage grasses grown for hay production","The objective of this study is to characterize six forage grass cultivars used for hay production. The morphological and morphometric characteristics of these cultivars were determined using a completely randomized block design, and the rates of loss of dry matter and crude protein (CP) were evaluated using a completely randomized design with a 6 x 5 factorial scheme (six cultivars vs. five drying periods [0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours]) and three repetitions. Morphological and morphometric characteristics and the chemical composition of the cultivars were analyzed using the Scott-Knott test, and the drying time was assessed using linear regression analysis at a level of significance of 5%. There was a significant effect (p < 0.05) of morphological and morphometric characteristics, except for stem thickness (p=0.1) and the live-to-dead biomass ratio (p=0.27). The Massai cultivar presented a higher leaf to stem ratio (1.23 ± 0.60). There was an increased linear response (p < 0.05) for the rate of water loss in the six evaluated cultivars. The Massai cultivar had a safe storage moisture content (80% dry matter) after 3 hours and 11 minutes of sun exposure, and the drying rate was 10.34% per hour of sun exposure. The cultivars Paredão and Marandú showed a decreasing linear effect of CP content across the harvest period, corresponding to 22.07% and 21.38 ± 0.55% in fresh plants, respectively, and 20.13% and 18.11 ± 0.55% after 4 hours of sun exposure, respectively.

41,2020,Performance and maternal-offspring behavior of ewes fed protected fat from palm oil,"This study aimed to evaluate the performance and maternal-offspring behavior of ewes fed protected fat from palm oil. Forty multiparous ewes with an average age of three years were divided into two treatments, with or without protected fat supplementation (in concentrate). Every 15 days and at the time of lambing, weighing and body condition evaluation of sheep were performed, while lambs were evaluated at birth until weaning. Duration of post-weaning anestrus was obtained through the manifestation of estrus, detected by a vasectomized male. Data were submitted to analysis of variance. No difference was observed between supplementations for body weight, body condition score, and average daily gain during the gestation phase. Ewes fed protected fat had a superiority regarding the body score during the lactation phase. Lambs from ewes supplemented with protected fat were weaned faster, and ewes presented an early estrus. No difference was observed between treatments for maternal-offspring behavior. The use of fat during lactation showed improvement in productive (body condition score) and reproductive (shorter anestrus period) parameters. It also reduces the weaning age of lambs and does not alter maternal-offspring behavior.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37452/27092,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Frugivorous flies and their parasitoids associated with native fruits in an urban area,"This study aimed to know the species of frugivorous flies (Tephritidae and Lonchaeidae) and their parasitoids associated with fruits in home orchards. It was conducted in the Gurgueia Valley, municipality of Bom Jesus, Piauí, Brazil. Fruit collection was carried out from April to December 2016. A total of 959 fruits (12 kg) belonging to seven fruit species were sampled, such as acerola (Malpighia glabra), carambola (Averrhoa carambola), lime (Citrus aurantifolia), balsam pear (Momordica charantia), cherry of the Rio Grande (Eugenia involucrata), umbu-cajá (Spondias bahiensis), and purple mombin (Spondias purpurea). Only three among these species (acerola, umbu-cajá, and purple mombin) were host, with 2,770 frugivorous flies. Umbu-cajá hosted 316 specimens of Anastrepha obliqua, from which puparia have emerged 84 specimens of Opius bellus and four of Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae. Purple mombin hosted Ceratitis capitata (2,384 specimens), Neosilba pendula (69 specimens), and Anastrepha sp. (one male). Eleven specimens of Tetrastichus giffardianus emerged from the puparia of C. capitata. Acerola hosted only one female of C. capitata and six specimens of N. pendula. Ceratitis capitata and N. pendula were recorded for the first-time infesting fruits of purple mombin in Piauí. Tetrastichus giffardianus parasitizing C. capitata in purple mombin was first recorded in the state of Piauí.

41,2020,Pasture characteristics and productive performance of dairy cows under two grazing management strategies,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the supply, morphological and chemical composition of forage, performance and milk composition of crossbred cows managed in Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania in intermittent grazing system with fixed and variable defoliation intervals according to the interception of 95% of photosynthetically active radiation by the canopy. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with two treatments and two area replications. In each grazing cycle the supply, morphological composition, forage nutritive value, dry matter intake, milk production and composition were determined. The experimental area was 4.0 hectares, divided into two blocks of 2 hectares. Each block was subdivided into 22 pickets (11 for each treatment) totaling 44 pickets with an area of 909 m2 each. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed for leaf blade content, in vitro digestibility of dry matter and forage crude protein, dry matter intake, individual and area milk production and lactose content milk, being the highest values found in the pastures managed with variable defoliation interval. Thus, the defoliation interval defined by the 95% interception of the photosynthetically luminosity leads to higher leaf blade proportions in the forage canopy, resulting in higher individual milk yield and per unit area, but with a loss of protein and total solids contents of milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37072/27090,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Twenty-four uncastrated male Hosltein calves were used. The experimental treatments included: integral milk (MI); 50% integral milk + 50% in natura whey cheese (MW); and 30% colostrum + 70% whey cheese (CW). Dry matter intake of concentrate (IDMC) and hay (IDMH), mean daily gain (MDG), and total weight gain (WGT) were evaluated. In addition, weights and yields of hot and cold carcasses, loss and breaking during cooling, and length and thoracic depth of the carcass, commercial cuts, and non-carcass components were measured. Resultantly, a significant effect (P < 0.05) was observed for IDMC, live weight at slaughter, warm carcass weight, cold carcass weight, and carcass length; here, MW and CS treatment differed from LS.

41,2020,Structure of piatã palisadegrass deferred for two periods and fertilised with nitrogen,"The deferred pasture structure determines the consumption and performance of grazing animals and, in addition, can be influenced by the duration of the deferment period and nitrogen (N) fertilisation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the structural characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha syn. Urochloa brizantha cv. Piatã (piatã palisadegrass) deferred for two periods (79 and 127 days) and with four N doses (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha-1) in the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The experimental design involved complete randomised blocks and a subdivided plot scheme, with three replications. The 127-day period of deferment resulted in a higher forage mass, falling index, stem percentage and density, but a lower number of tillers, percentage and volumetric density of live leaf blade. The N dose increment, in general, worsened the structural characteristics of the piatã palisadegrass deferred for 127 days. However, with the 79-day period, the N fertilisation increased the volumetric density of live leaf blades and reduced the stem percentage in the forage mass. As a preliminary recommendation, piatã palisadegrass can be deferred for 79 days and fertilised with up to 90 kg ha-1 of N in the region of Zona da Mata de Minas Gerais, Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36842/27087,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Feeding, rumination, rest, other activities and social, body care, anomalous, playful and locomotion behavior were observed. To examine the productive responses, initial weight, final weight, average daily weight gain, total weight gain, carcass yield, conformation and fatness were measured. Behaviors referring to feeding, rumination and other activities did not differ between the breed groups, except for the rest, playful and locomotion behaviors. A significant difference was detected (p < 0.05) for respiratory frequency and productive characteristics between the breed groups. In conclusion, ½ Guzerat × ½ Aberdeen Angus were superior to Guzerat cattle in productive performance. However, for behavioral and physiological variables, Guzerat animals exhibited better performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36829/27086,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Chemical composition, aerobic stability, and fermentation pattern of white oat silage wilted with glyphosate","White oat has good nutritional quality but is not an easy forage to ensile due to its high buffer capacity and moisture content at ensiling moment. Therefore, wilting is necessary to offset such negative aspects. However, this process demands skilled workforce and adequate machinery. In this way, chemical desiccation is a promising technology to reduce the steps needed for wilting. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of glyphosate as a chemical desiccant on the nutritional quality, fermentation pattern, losses, and aerobic stability of wilted white oat (Avena sativa) silages. White oat sowing occurred in the first fortnight of May 2013. Desiccant application took place when oat reached milky-dough grain stage (96 days after planting). Glyphosate doses evaluated were 0, 500, 750, 1000, and 1250 mL ha?1. Three days after desiccation, all treatments were ensiled, and the silos were stored for 150 days. A completely randomized design was used, and all statistical procedures were performed by means of Bayesian Inference. No differences were found for lactic acid, but treated-silage pH linearly decreased. The lowest concentration of butyric acid (3.40 mg kg-1) was observed at 900.80 mL ha-1. For ammonia, the highest point (50 g kg-1) occurred at 916.51 mL ha-1. Aerobic stability was not influenced by treatments. Maximum dry matter recovery index (934 g kg-1) was observed at 864.20 mL ha-1 glyphosate. Wilted forage from treatments 500 mL ha-1, 750 mL ha-1, and 1000 mL ha-1 had greater dry matter content compared to control (320.1, 326, 301.3, and 270.7 g kg-1 respectively). Hemicellulose linearly decreased and crude protein linearly increased. The lowest concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (642.8 g kg-1) and neutral-detergent insoluble nitrogen (2.30 g kg-1) occurred at doses of 1141.32 mL ha-1 and 829.14 mL ha-1, respectively. In brief, for wilted white oat silage production, harvested at milky-dough grain stage, glyphosate application prior to ensiling up to 1000 mL ha-1 led to better conservation compared to non-treated silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36781/27085,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Body growth description of male and female from three broilers strains in the hot climate,"To evaluate the growth of males and females from three broiler strains (Cobb 500, Ross 308, and Hubbard Flex) we used a completely randomized experimental design with a factorial arrangement (3 strains and 2 sexes) and six replicates of 60 birds each, 2160 chicks of both sexes in total followed for 56 days. Once a week, the birds from each pen were weighed to estimate the average weight. The sample birds were fasted for 24 hours, re-weighed, slaughtered, eviscerated, and dissected to obtain the breast, thigh and drumstick cuts. The fitted Gompertz equations were used for each strain, and sex, for the fasted weight, and the weight of breasts, thighs, and drumsticks. To verify the effect of strain on the Gompertz curve parameters we assessed the weight at maturity (Wm), rate of maturing (b), and the time at which maximum growth rate was attained (t*) for both sexes and verified the equivalence of parameters and identity of non-linear models. For the fasted weight the rate of maturing was very similar for all strains and sexes, but the Hubbard strain showed the highest Wm and t*. The Wm parameter was common for most cuts among the strains, and the Hubbard was the dominant strain with the highest b parameter. All three parameters were similar for the male breast weight, and only one equation required adjustment to describe the breast weight growth for the three strains. Individually adjusted equations were necessary to describe the weight of drumsticks because females showed no similarity in any of the parameters for any strain.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36552/27082,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Initial height and nitrogen fertilisation on deferred pastures of marandu palisadegrass,"In deferred pastures, nitrogen fertilisation and pasture height at the beginning of the deferment period modify the structure and nutritive value of forage. This work was conducted to determine the nitrogen (N) doses and sward heights that were adequate for the deferment of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu syn. Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (marandu palisadegrass). Two sward heights (15 and 30 cm) and four N rates (0, 40, 80,120 kg/ha) at the beginning of the deferment period were evaluated in a randomised block design and a factorial scheme with three replications. At the end of the deferment period, the numbers of live and dead tillers, the numbers of tillers with different sizes, the masses of live leaf lamina, dead leaf lamina, live stem and dead stem, the litter mass and the crude protein and neutral detergent fibre contents of the forage were evaluated. With nitrogen fertilisation, there was an increase in the masses of live leaf and live stem in the deferred canopy. With the application of 80 kg/ha of N, the litter mass was higher in the deferred canopy with a height of 30 cm, in relation to that with a height of 15 cm. The highest canopy presented greater stem mass and worse nutritional value when compared to the lowest one. In order to improve forage characteristics, marandu palisadegrass can be deferred by 15 cm and fertilised with 80 kg/ha N. When marandu palisade grass is deferred to 30 cm, nitrogen doses lower than 80 kg/ha can be applied.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36753/27084,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Use of Duddingtonia flagrans in the control of gastrointestinal nematodes of feedlot goats,"This study aimed to evaluate the use of a sodium alginate matrix-pelletized formulation of Duddingtonia flagrans for biological control of gastrointestinal nematodiasis in feedlot goats in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil. We used 20 Saanen female goats (age, 4 months; average weight, 12 kg) that did not receive anthelmintic treatment and had counting of eggs per gram of faeces (EPGs) ? 500. The animals were divided into two groups: in group 1 (D. flagrans group), each animal received 3 g of pellets (0.6 g of D. flagrans mycelium) per 10 kg of body weight, twice a week, over 4 months; and in group 2 (control group), each animal received 3 g of pellets without fungus per 10 kg of body weight, twice a week, over 4 months. Each group was maintained in a separate 15-m2 stall. Larval cultures and measurements of weight, EPG, and packed cell volume (PCV) were performed every 15 days. We observed low EPG levels in the D. flagrans group throughout the experimental period, with a significant difference (p < 0.05) on day 30 and from day 60, having, at the end of the experiment, average OPG values of only 150, reduction of 92.3% when compared to control group. Haemonchus sp. was the most prevalent helminth in all larval cultures. The D. flagrans group showed a mean weight gain of 8.8 kg at the end of the experiment (p < 0.05), while the control group showed a mean weight gain of 4.8 kg. The best PCV results (p < 0.05) were also observed in the D. flagrans group from day 30. Thus, the use of D. flagrans pellets in a sodium alginate matrix was effective in controlling gastrointestinal nematodiasis of feedlot goats in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36877/27122,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Supplementation levels for suckling female calves under grazing: productive and nutritional performance and metabolic profile,"The objective in this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation levels on productive and nutritional performance and metabolic profile in suckling female calves under grazing. Forty female calves (averaging 3.5±0.06 months and 127.3±2.68 kg), and their respective dams were distributed in a completely randomized design with two treatments and twenty replicates. The treatments were 1) 4 g kg-1 body weight (BW) of supplement or 2) 6 g kg-1 BW of supplement. Forage and organic matter (OM) intake did not affect (P > 0.05) by levels of supplement, though crude protein and non-fibrous carbohydrates intake were greater (P < 0.05) by increasing supplementation level. There was no effect (P > 0.05) the supplementation levels on OM and CP digestibility. The metabolic profile of the animals was not affected (P > 0.05) by supplementation level. Average daily gain, longissimus dorsi area, fat thickness over rump of the animals did not affect (P > 0.05) by levels of supplement. However, there was trend of increasing (P=0.074) in fat thickness over loin by increase the supplementation level. Although the body growth of animals was similar (P > 0.05) between treatments, there was observed a trend of increase (P=0.064) in ratio BW:Height at the withers by increasing supplementation levels. In conclusion, increasing the supplementation level of 4 to 6 g kg-1 of BW, not improve the productive and nutritional performance and metabolic status in female calves under grazing on creep-feeding system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36581/27083,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Molecular diagnosis and risk factors of canine ehrlichiosis in the municipality of Itabuna-Bahia, Brazil","Ehrlichiosis is an emerging zoonosis worldwide and has had several adverse effects on public health. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME), caused by Ehrlichia canis, has the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus as the vector. The main clinical signs in affected dogs are fever, apathy, anorexia, weight loss, and neurological signs. The diagnosis is made through the association of clinical signs with parasitological, serological, and molecular tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of E. canis infection in dogs from the city of Itabuna-Bahia, as well as to identify the risk factors related to infection. For this, 405 dogs from the Center for Zoonoses Control (CCZ), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and dogs domiciled and semi-domiciled in the city of Itabuna, southern Bahia, were evaluated. After initial physical evaluation of the dogs, blood samples were collected by venipuncture for subsequent DNA extraction and E. canis testing using the nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (nested-PCR) technique. In addition, an epidemiological questionnaire that included questions related to the animals was administered to the dog owners to identify the risk factors for exposure to the etiological agent and to the vector. Approximately 17% of the dogs in the municipality of Itabuna-Bahia tested positive for E. canis by nested-PCR, a result higher than that found in other studies conducted in the same municipality. Among the factors associated with E. canis infection, contact with other dogs (p = 0.0226) was an important factor for the dissemination of CME, since dogs are reported to be reservoirs of E. canis. Male dogs (p = 0.0016) presented lower risk for E. canis infection. Other studies, however, describe no association between animal gender and infection by E. canis. Preventive measures to reduce exposure to the vector of ehrlichiosis are necessary.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36262/27079,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Detection of bluetongue virus antibodies in sheep from Paraná, Brazil","Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious and non-contagious disease caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) belonging to the genus Orbivirus. It is transmitted by a hematophagous vector, Culicoides sp., to ruminants, particularly to sheep, which are most susceptible to this disease. The main serological tests are agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), which is recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA), which has the advantage of no cross-reaction with other orbiviruses. The aim was to compare the results of these two tests by conducting them on sera collected from sheep in the state of Paraná, Brazil. From March to October 2017, serum samples were collected from 270 sheep from 10 farms in six mesoregions of Paraná. The samples were subjected to AGID and cELISA to detect antibodies against BTV. Based on the test results, we classified the sheep as low, moderate, and high occurrence. The results demonstrated that 64.81% (175/270) of the sheep were seropositive through the cELISA test, showing a high occurrence, and 41.11% (111/270) were seropositive through the AGID test, indicating a moderate occurrence. The concordance between the tests was moderate (0.51) as determined by the Kappa coefficient. Among the studied farms, 90% (9/10) presented at least one seropositive sheep, and the number of animals tested positive by the cELISA test was higher than those by the AGID test. Favorable climate, which favors the presence and multiplication of the culicoid vector and the occurrence of infection, was the biggest predominant factor responsible for the obtained results. The low occurrence in farms with milder climate suggest that the presence of antibodies also occurs due to the low pathogenicity of circulating serotypes in the different mesoregions studied. It is concluded that BTV infection is present in the sheep herds in Paraná, and the occurrence was moderate detected by AGID test and high detected by cELISA test.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34454/27077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Dipyrone, scopolamine, and meloxicam for conventional or two-port laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy in female dogs","For ethical and organic reasons, surgical and analgesic techniques that minimize and adequately control pain should be studied. Ovariohysterectomy is the most common surgical technique in veterinary medicine and is performed in female dogs for elective or therapeutic purposes. Both conventional and minimally invasive surgical techniques are used in veterinary medicine; however, the minimally invasive laparoscopic technique is considered superior to the conventional technique because it is associated with a less painful and faster post-operative recovery. However, for various reasons, the laparoscopic technique is not yet widely used in veterinary medicine, and the conventional ovariohysterectomy is still the most common. The aim of this study, therefore, was to validate the efficacy of the combination of dipyrone, scopolamine, and meloxicam after conventional or two-port laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomies in female dogs. Additionally, this study sought to assess recovery after the two surgical modalities while receiving the same analgesic protocol. Fourteen healthy adult female dogs were spayed and then evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale, the Melbourne Scale, and the short form of the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale for 72 hours after surgery. The analgesic protocol was efficient for pain control after both techniques, with minimal differences between the groups.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35322/27103,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Serological prevalence of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD-1) in non-vaccinated dairy cattle in the municipality of Realeza-Paraná,"Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is an infectious and contagious disease affecting cattle that is responsible for causing a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from inapparent or subclinical infections to an acute and sometimes fatal disease known as mucosal disease. The agent that causes BVD is an RNA virus of the genus Pestivirus and family Flaviridae. BVD is transmitted in two different ways: horizontal, by secretions, and vertically in pregnant cows, where the cow transmits the virus to the foetus. The clinical signs depend on the affected animal, its immunological capacity, and in the case of pregnant females, the gestation phase. A gestational infection can result in several changes, such as congenital anomalies, abortion, or even the birth of so-called persistently infected (PI) animals, which are difficult to detect and have a very important epidemiological role within the herd. The southwest region of Paraná has the largest dairy basin in the state of Paraná and is predominantly composed of family farmers, many of whom adopt measures that increase the health risk of their herd. The objective of this study was to delineate the serological prevalence of non-vaccinated dairy cattle in the municipality of Royalty-PR in relation to the BVD-1 virus, as well as to evaluate the odds ratios, relative risk and risk attributable to the independent variables of breed, age and the community under study. To that end, 317 blood serum samples from non-vaccinated cows from 18 different farms, with various breeds and ages, were evaluated by virus neutralization for the detection of antibodies specific to BVD-1. The results showed that 17.03% of the animals (54/317) had positive BVD-1 serology, and 82.33% (15/18) of the farms had at least one positive animal. Animals of the Jersey breed and the Barra do Sarandi Line community had the highest epidemiological risks, with a strong association with BVD-1 infection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36726/27080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Regionalization of reference streamflows for the Araguaia River basin in Brazil,"Hydraulic projects and water management require reliable hydrological data. The Araguaia-Tocantins River basin, in addition to agricultural use, has great potential for hydroelectric exploitation. However, the streamflow monitoring network in the Araguaia River basin is composed of only a few stations, resulting in a lack of hydrological data. The regionalization of the reference streamflows is a technique that can help circumvent this lack of data, enabling the estimation of streamflows from easily obtainable explanatory variables. In this context, the objective of this study was to develop regional functions for the maximum streamflow (Qmax) applicable to different Return Periods (RP), the long-term mean streamflow (Qmlt) and the 95% streamflow permanence (Q95) of the upper and middle Araguaia River sub-basins. The dimensionless streamflow methodology was adopted with the drainage area as an explanatory variable. The tested regressive models were the linear, potential and quotient models. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to assess the quality of the regional models. Ten statistical distributions of 2 to 5 parameters were used. (i) Satisfactory results were obtained for all reference streamflows. (ii) The cross-validation technique proved to be essential for the selection of the most robust model. (iii) The quotient model was shown to be superior to the potential linear model in most cases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36430/27074,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Histochemical changes induced by Trichoderma spp. and potassium phosphite in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in response to the attack by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum,"Induction of resistance in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) has been considered a promising alternative to control anthracnose. Among the changes generated in the induction of resistance, structural changes have been reported by several authors as an efficient form of resistance to the stress plants undergo. Histochemical analysis techniques have been used to investigate tissue changes triggered by induction of resistance. Thus, this study aims to investigate certain histochemical changes suffered by common bean plants induced with potassium phosphite and Trichoderma spp. in response to the attack by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, aiming to determine the host response pattern in terms of structural changes, associating it to possible disease control. Treatments consisted of isolates T. harzianum (isolate TOD1) and T. virens (isolate TM4), leaf fertilizer potassium phosphite Fertilis®, and distilled water (control). Inducers were applied to common bean alone or associated, consisting of five treatments plus the control treatment. The six treatments were evaluated for the absence and presence of C. lindemuthianum in a factorial scheme (6×2). Treatments allowed evaluating the severity of anthracnose in common bean, location of H2O2, lignin deposition, and hypersensitivity response in common bean hypocotyl by histochemical staining. Potassium phosphite and combinations of T. virens and T. harzianum with potassium phosphite efficiently reduced disease severity under greenhouse conditions, reaching 68, 84, and 71%, respectively. Studies with hypocotyl showed that T. harzianum + potassium phosphite and T. virens + potassium phosphite accelerated the H2O2 accumulation process and lignin deposition at the pathogen penetration site, in addition to the hypersensitivity reaction through the resistance-inducing activity, contributing to the protection of common bean against anthracnose caused by C. lindemuthianum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35260/27073,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Tracing the origin of reservoir sediments using magnetic properties in Southeastern Brazil,"Determining the origin of eroded soil is essential to design effective soil erosion control strategies which preserve the soil resource, enhance agricultural productivity, and reduce the negative impacts of soil erosion, in-field and off-field. Magnetic properties have been widely used in temperate environments to identify sediment sources, pathways and links, but there have been very few applications in tropical and subtropical environments. Therefore, in this paper we investigated reservoir sediment sources in the Upper Grande River Basin, Southeastern Brazil, using sediment tracing techniques based on magnetic parameters (low and high frequency magnetic susceptibility, frequency dependent susceptibility). The different parent materials and subtropical weathering conditions resulted in soils having different Fe oxide minerals and Fe oxide contents, promoting magnetic variability that allowed comparison and identification of possible sources of reservoir sediments in order to reduce water erosion impacts. The results indicate the suitability of magnetic properties as a tracer for soil erosion studies in tropical environments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36899/27121,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Energy efficiency and emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O in organic and conventional rice production","Rice is the second-most produced cereal worldwide and actively contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly methane, especially under deepwater production. Assessments of energy efficiency (EE) and GHG emissions can indicate the sustainability level of agrosystems and support decisions related to the reduction of production costs and environmental pollution. This study aimed to assess both EE and GHG emissions in organic and conventional rice production in the Southern region of Brazil. For this study, eight rice fields were evaluated. Energy inputs and outputs were calculated by multiplying the production input amounts by their respective calorific values or energy coefficients at each stage of production. EE was determined using the ratio between the total energy output and the total energy consumed during the production process. GHG emissions were estimated using the principles of the lifecycle assessment methodology in addition to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendations. Each 1.0 MJ consumed during the production of organic and conventional rice produced renewable energy averages of 10.5 MJ and 7.90 MJ, respectively, as grains. The primary energy expenses for organic rice were represented by seeds, fuel, tractors, and agricultural machinery and implements, and those for conventional rice were seeds, fuel, and fertilizers. Each kilogram of organic and conventional rice produced accounted for the emission of 0.21 and 0.32 kg of CO2eq, respectively, during the production cycles and delivery to the warehouse, with seeds, fuel, and fertilizers being the main sources of CO2eq emissions to the atmosphere.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35197/27072,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Drying and storage of macaúba fruit: chemical and oxidative stability,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical and oxidative stability of dried macaúba (Acrocomia totai) fruit in different air conditions and stored for up to 120 days. The macaúba fruits were collected, sanitized, dried at the temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C and stored in raffia bags at room temperature. Drying at higher temperatures resulted in pulps with a darker and orangish color and pulp oil with lower titratable acidity contents and acidity indices. Throughout storage, there was an increase in the acidity index of pulp oil and a reduction in the ascorbic acid and carotenoid contents in the pulp. Drying and storage reduced the ascorbic acid and carotenoid contents of the pulp. Drying at lower temperatures results in pulps with a higher free-radical sequestering ability. Pulp oil quality was compromised by drying and storage time. Newly harvested macaúba fruits can be dried at 40, 50, 60 or 70 °C and stored for up to 120 days without compromising nut oil quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37011/27076,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Plot size and number of replications in Sudan grass,"The aim of this study was to determine the optimal plot size and the number of replications to evaluate fresh weight in Sudan grass [Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf.]. Twenty-six uniformity trials were carried out in two cultivars (BRS Estribo and CG Farrapo), in four sowing seasons (20 Dec, 20 Jan, 7 Feb and 24 Feb) and two methods for evaluating fresh weight (cutting and at flowering). The fresh weight was evaluated in 936 basic experimental units (BEU) (26 trials × 36 BEU per trial). One BEU comprised three rows of plants, 1 m in length (1.2 m2). The optimal plot size was determined using the maximum curvature method of the model of the coefficient of variation. For experiments in a completely randomised or randomised block design, in combinations of number of treatments and levels of experimental precision, the number of replications was determined by an iterative process. The optimal plot size to evaluate fresh weight in Sudan grass is 7.95 m2. Eight replications, to evaluate up to 50 treatments in a completely randomised or randomised block design, are sufficient to identify as significant at 0.05% probability by Tukey’s test, differences between the mean value of each treatment of 30.2% of the mean value of the experiment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35097/27070,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Key locations for soybean genotype assessment in South Brazil region,"Mitigating the high costs of soybean breeding programs requires constant improvement of all the involved processes. Identifying representative and discriminating test locations, as well as excluding redundant and/or non-representative locations, makes it possible to select genotypes with more accuracy while reducing the costs of the multi-environment trials (MET). Therefore, this study had three objectives: to evaluate the representativeness and discriminating power of test locations; to identify similar test locations for each Edaphoclimatic Region (ECR) and locations that did not contribute to genotype evaluation; and to recommend the best locations for evaluating MET in order to reduce breeding program costs in the soybean macro regions 1 (M1) and 2 (M2). Grain yield (GY) data from ‘Value-for-Cultivation-and-Use’ (VCU) trials obtained during the 2012-2016 crop seasons were used, totaling 132 environments (location x year) and 43 genotypes. The experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Representative and discriminant locations were identified by GGL (genotype main effects plus genotype × location interaction) + GGE (genotype main effects plus genotype × environment interaction) analysis, using GGEbiplot software. Representative and discriminant locations were identified for each ECR and can be used as core locations for breeding programs. Similarly, locations that were not representative and discriminant, or that present redundancy in the results, should be excluded from or replaced in MET. The most recommended locations for conducting VCU trials in M1 are: Cachoeira do Sul (ECR 101); Ronda Alta, Passo Fundo, Santa Bárbara do Sul, and Ciríaco (ECR 102); and Castro (ECR 103). For M2, the most suitable locations are Rolândia, Marechal Cândido Rondon, Campo Mourão, Santa Terezinha de Itaipu, Palotina, Floresta, and Londrina (ECR 201); Naviraí (ECR 202); and Ponta Porã and Maracajú (ECR 204).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33049/27069,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Postharvest quality and brown rot incidence in plums treated with Ascophyllum nodosum extract,"The use of extracts of algae in agriculture has been growing because of their benefits to plant development and production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ascophyllum nodosum extract on the postharvest quality of ‘Irati’ and ‘Reubennel’ plums and on the incidence of brown rot. The treatments consisted of concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mL L-1 of a commercial product containing algae extract (Algamare®) that were applied to the fruits by immersion. The fruits were then stored for 15 (cv. Irati) or 30 days (cv. Reubennel) at 2.5 °C and 90% RH and for two additional days at ambient conditions for further physicochemical analysis. A batch of ‘Reubennel’ plums was inoculated with Monilinia fructicola and kept for seven days in a cold room and an additional nine days at room temperature to evaluate the occurrence of brown rot. The postharvest application of the extract at a concentration of 0.4 mL L-1 altered some of the physicochemical characteristics of the fruit after storage; an increase in the total phenolic compound content and PG activity were observed in ‘Irati’ plums. Reubennel fruits had higher titratable acidity, a lower TSS/TA ratio, lower pulp firmness and higher PME activity. The most significant effect was observed with the application of A. nodosum extract at 0.4 mL L-1, which significantly reduced the incidence and severity of brown rot in the inoculated fruits and had a similar control effect as the application of the fungicide iprodione.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33803/27068,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study aimed to assess the chemical composition of surface and groundwater samples collected from the São Pedro river basin, in the municipality of Faxinal (PR-Brazil). Thirty-eight samples were collected in total: nineteen from rivers, two in dams, eleven at sites with springs, one in a shallow well, and five in deep wells part of the Guarani Aquifer System. Samples were collected in the rainy and dry seasons to determine the concentrations of the following elements: Magnesium, Copper, Manganese, Zinc, Chromium, Nickel, Aluminum, Lead, Mercury, and Cadmium, which were quantified using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results were compared with the standards established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health Ordinance n. 2914/2011, which regulates the drinking water standard for human consumption in Brazil. Manganese, Aluminum, and Mercury levels were observed to be above those required by the standards established by the legislation, indicating that further studies are necessary to detect possible sources of pollution in these waters as well as highlighting the potential risks to human health and ultimately contributing to the environmental planning of this basin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33798/27120,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Autosomal recessive inheritance of cutaneous asthenia in a dog - case report,"Cutaneous asthenia (CA) or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, in dogs, is a rare hereditary syndrome caused by autosomal dominant inheritance that causes collagen synthesis failure and leads to hyperextensibility and cutaneous fragility. This report describes a clinical case of canine CA of hereditary recessive origin, hitherto proven for other species, in an animal born from inbreeding healthy parents. A one-year-old female Maltese dog received clinical and surgical care for a cutaneous wound after a hygienic bath. The clinical history revealed the occurrence of other injuries that were caused by minor trauma and the consanguinity of the patient. During wound cleaning, the trichotomy and removal of an adhesive tape that was fixed to the skin generated new lacerations, which led to clinical suspicion of CA. CA was confirmed by calculating the cutaneous extensibility index (CEI), which was 22%, higher than the normal limit for the species (14.5%). The skin biopsy confirmed the clinical diagnosis, and the wound of the animal was treated routinely and healed clinically. Both dominant and recessive patterns have been well documented in cats; however, in dogs, only the dominant form has been reported in the literature. Our findings demonstrate that canine CA may result from autosomal recessive inheritance, and CA must be considered during diagnostic clinical approaches and breeding selections.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34980/26889,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Use of palatal prosthesis to correct an acquired palatal cleft in a cat: a case report,"Palatal malformations rarely occur in small animals. Palatal clefts can affect the upper lip, hard palate, and soft palate, and may be congenital or acquired in origin. The most common acquired forms result from the excision of oral neoplasia, teeth extraction, perforating lesions, automobile accidents, and electric accidents. Clinical signs of a fissured palate are sneezing, purulent nasal discharge, salivary secretion in nasal discharge, difficulty feeding and drinking, and pneumonia due to aspiration, which are the most severe alterations and can lead to death. The treatment of palatal clefts consists of occlusion of the oronasal communication, which can be performed using mucoperiosteal grafts, pedicled flaps, or palatal obturators. Herein, we report a case of an acquired palatal cleft treated with a palatal obturator in a feline patient who bit a high-tension wire. Two attempts of surgical correction had been unsuccessful, resulting in suture dehiscence and perpetuation of the oronasal fistula. After fixation of the obturator, the animal showed remission of all clinical signs. The animal has survived for over one year with improved quality of life.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33356/26886,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Arterial thromboembolism of non-cardiogenic origin in a domestic feline with ischemia and reperfusion syndrome – a case report,"Arterial thromboembolism (ATE) is an acute and severe clinical condition resulting from the formation of a thrombus and its accommodation in an artery, impairing the perfusion of tissues irrigated by it. In felines, it is often related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but there are reports of its association with neoplasms. Ischemia and reperfusion syndrome may occur secondary to ATE and result in difficult to correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. The aim of the present study is to describe a case of ATE, including its clinical and laboratory findings and electrolyte and acid-base changes compatible with ischemia and reperfusion syndrome. A 14-year-old crossbreed female feline with sudden pelvic limb paralysis was treated at the Feline Medicine Service of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. Clinical and laboratory alterations included hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, azotemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The electrocardiogram indicated sinoventricular rhythm, and echocardiogram evaluation showed no alterations. Thorax radiographic evaluation revealed areas of higher radiopacity in the pulmonary fields. We opted for abdominal aorta arteriotomy as an emergency treatment for thrombus removal. The feline died in the postoperative period, and histopathological examination of lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and heart were performed, being compatible with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis. This study deals with a case of ATE of possible neoplastic origin, which is uncommon in cats. In this case, the patient had difficult-to-manage hemodynamic impairment, as well as electrolyte and acid-base balance disorders severe and refractory to therapy, culminating in death. The time to start treatment from the presentation of clinical signs may be determinant in therapeutic success, reducing the possible effects of reperfusion syndrome.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33827/26887,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Linfoma multicêntrico de Células T em uma potra Crioula,"A 2-year-old creole filly was referred to us for evaluation because of the clinical suspicion of infection by Streptococcus equi. It presented with progressive weight loss and increased volume of the submandibular, retropharyngeal, and precrural lymph nodes. General clinical examinations and laboratory tests revealed dehydration, anemia, leukopenia, hyperfibrinogenemia, and thrombocytopenia. The initial treatment for equine adenitis did not achieve significant results, and new hematological and biochemical tests and lymph node cytology by puncture were performed. Cytology revealed cells compatible with neoplastic lymphocytes, resulting in the suspicion of lymphoma. The animal died from general weakness and was sent for autopsy. Macroscopically, generalized lymphadenomegaly and splenomegaly were observed, with multiple nodules and tumor lesions in the splenic parenchyma. There was an irregular nodule in the medullary layer of the right kidney. The liver and lungs were slightly enlarged, with petechiae and multifocal suffusions. Histopathological evaluation of different organ specimens revealed intense proliferation of the neoplastic lymphoid cells, invading the adjacent tissues, with moderate cellular pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry of the lymph node sections with neoplastic infiltration revealed multicentric T-cell lymphoma. In horses, cases of lymphomas are rare and should be differentiated from other causes that induce lymphadenomegaly in this species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34900/26888,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Neospora caninum in commercial sheep from northwest of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Neospora caninum is a widely distributed parasite, which significantly impacts reproduction in ruminants. This study aimed to survey the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with neosporosis infection in commercial herds of sheep in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Three hundred sheep serum samples were used to investigate anti-N. caninum antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence reaction at a 1:40 dilution. The presence of anti-N. caninum antibodies was detected in 20.3% (61/300) of the samples evaluated; however, positive reactions were observed in all (13/13) flocks sampled. Sheep breeds > 1 year of age had 1.2-fold higher risk for infection with N. caninum (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1-5.1]; P < 0.001). These findings should raise awareness on the importance of serological screening, identification of risk factors, and maintenance of preventive measures, such as not allowing dogs to contact sheep feed and not offering the placental remains of ruminants to canids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36624/26885,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Occurrence of antibodies against Neospora caninum in sows and factors associated with infection in commercial herds in two regions of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil","Neosporosis is a disease that affects ruminants, horses, swine, and wild animals, causing reproductive disorders and economic losses. The importance of the infection in pigs has not been fully elucidated. The objective of the present study was to verify the occurrence of antibodies against Neospora caninum and the possible factors associated with infection in swine herds from two regions of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. A total of 498 blood samples were collected from sows of western (five properties) and southern (four properties) regions of the state, and an epidemiological questionnaire was administered. Sera obtained from the blood were tested by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) (cutoff point 1:50) using tachyzoites of N. caninum NC1 strain as antigen. Positive samples were two-fold serially diluted until maximum reactivity titer. The results were analyzed using Fisher and Chi-square tests to determine correlation between serology and associated factors. The overall prevalence was 18.9% (94/498) with titers of 50 (27), 100 (26), 200 (22), 400 (10), and 800 (9). Eighty of 256 samples (31.3%) from the western region were positive, while 14 out of 242 samples (5.8%) from the southern region were positive. A correlation (p < 0.01) was observed among the seroprevalence and contact with dogs (OR = 3.97, IC 2.64-6.43), presence of rodents (OR = 7.37 IC 4.06-13.50), and water source (OR = 2.38 IC 1.44-3.91). The use of anti-bird nets was identified as a protective factor against infection (OR = 0.36 IC 0.07-0.25). These results demonstrate the high prevalence of antibodies against N. caninum in commercial swine herds in the state of Santa Catarina compared to that in other regions of Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36536/26882,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The Serra da Tiririca State Park (PESET) is an Atlantic forest reserve that is home to a wide variety of wild animal species, but is suffering from unauthorised human activities, such as unregulated construction, such as private dwellings and the introduction of domestic pets. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. in dogs and ticks in the Atlantic Forest reserve. Blood samples were taken from 124 asymptomatic canines and 88 Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks collected from animals inhabiting the PESET. Molecular techniques targeting fragments of the 18s rRNA gene from piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. were applied to all samples obtained, and one blood sample (0.81%) positive for Babesia vogeli was discovered. All dogs tested negative to Hepatozoon spp. and no tick sample showed positive results for either PCR assay. Despite the low frequency of B. vogeli infection found in dogs that inhabit the PESET, parasitized dogs could be a source of transmission for new vectors, other dogs and even wild canines that are part of the native fauna of the park.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35343/26881,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Crude protein in diets for European quail (Coturnix coturnix),"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of dietary crude protein (CP) levels on the production performance, carcass traits and dietary nutrient metabolizability of European quail from one to 35 days of age. A total of 250 quail were allotted to one of five treatments (21, 22, 23, 24 and 25% CP) in a completely randomized experimental design with five replicates of 10 birds per plot. The following variables were evaluated: feed intake; weight gain; feed conversion; energy and protein intakes; weight and yield of carcass, cuts and edible offal; metabolizability coefficients (MC) of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract and gross energy; and nitrogen intake, excretion, retention and metabolizability. Weight gain rose linearly (P < 0.05) from one to 14 days of age. From 15 to 35 days of age, weight gain decreased (P < 0.05) and feed conversion ratio worsened (P < 0.05). The CP levels did not influence (P > 0.05) feed intake, weight gain or feed conversion from one to 35 days of age. Protein intake increased linearly (P < 0.05) in all evaluated periods. The absolute and relative weights of legs responded quadratically (P < 0.05). At 35 days of age, the absolute and relative weights of liver had decreased linearly (P < 0.05). In the metabolism trial, a linear decrease was observed (P < 0.05) for the MC of dry matter, crude protein and nitrogen, whereas the MC of ether extract, nitrogen intake and nitrogen excretion increased linearly (P < 0.05).

41,2020,Tillering and characterisation of tillers on marandu palisadegrass deferred and fertilised with nitrogen,"Evaluations of tillering dynamics and characteristics of the individual tillers allow the changes that occur in the growth and structure of the deferred and nitrogen (N) fertilised pasture to be understood. This work was carried out to evaluate the tillering and morphological characteristics of basal tillers in deferred canopies of Brachiaria brizantha syn. Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (marandu palisadegrass) submitted to two N doses (50 and 200 kg ha-1). The evaluations were carried out at the beginning, middle and end of the deferment period. The experimental design was completely randomised in split-plot design with four replications. Tiller appearance rate (TAR) was higher at the beginning than in the middle and at the end of the deferment period, contrary to that observed for the number and weight of the tiller. Tiller mortality rate (TMR) was higher at the end than at the beginning and in the middle of the deferment period. The tiller population stability index (SI) was similar at the beginning and middle, but lower at the end of the deferment period. The leaf area of the tiller was higher in the middle compared to at the beginning and end of deferment. N dose did not influence TAR, TMR and SI. The canopy fertilised with 200 kg ha-1 of N presented a higher number and weight of tiller compared to the canopy fertilised with 50 kg ha-1 of N. The N increases the number and weight of tillers, but does not change tillering dynamics during the deferment period for marandu palisadegrass. The tillering decreases and the morphological composition of the tiller worsens with the increase in the deferment period in marandu palisadegrass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36698/26876,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Termination of lambs fed concentrate or pasture: performance and technical feasibility,"A total of 28 uncastrated lambs, with 20kg of body mass (BM) were distributed into two different finishing systems where animals were fed either concentrate (CFS) or pasture (PFS) until 35 kg BM. The CFS diet consisted of 77.4% of corn grain; 20.2% soybean meal; 1.4% limestone and 1.0% sodium bicarbonate. The PFS diet consisted of both native pasture and ryegrass. The evaluated parameters were: dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), crude protein intake (CPI), neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI), feed conversion (FC), mean daily gain, days to reach 35kg BM, ruminal pH, in vivo biometric measurements, carcass composition, percentage of commercial cuts, pallet composition, and proportion of body components. The CFS animals had higher DMI, OMI, CPI and lower NDFI when compared to PFS. Also, animals feed CFS presented higher mean daily gain and better FC. Animals from CFS took 77 days to reach 35kg BM whereas animals from PFS took 278 days. The ruminal pH was higher, and more adequate, in the PFS group when compared to the CFS group. The CFS lambs presented better quantitative characteristics and conformation, and higher fat deposition. PFS lambs, on the other hand, provided leaner and more muscular carcasses. Thus, the termination of lambs without use of bulky feed is technically feasible and provides better zootechnical performance and carcass characteristics. However, the ruminal pH drop may compromise the system and must be observed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36729/26877,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Nutritional composition, metabolizability coefficients and use of passion fruit pulp waste in the diet of meat quail","Two experiments were undertaken to evaluate the chemical composition and metabolizability coefficient of passion fruit pulp waste and its effect on the production performance of meat quail when included in their diet at different levels. In experiment I, a metabolism trial was conducted as a completely randomized design (CRD) involving 90 meat quail that received one of two treatments (control diet and test diet), with five replicates and nine birds per plot. To determine the metabolizability coefficients, the total collection method was performed from 18 to 21 days of age. In experiment II, 225 European quail were allotted to one of five treatments (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12% inclusion of passion fruit pulp waste) in a CRD with five replicates and nine birds per experimental unit. No significant differences were observed (p > 0.05) for weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion or carcass yield between the different waste inclusion levels. The nutritional composition of the waste was 2,925.75 kcal AME/kg, 2,922.09 kcal AMEn/kg, 20.86% ether extract and 10.72% crude protein. Passion fruit pulp waste can be included up to 12% in the diet of meat quail from one to 42 days of age without affecting their production performance or carcass characteristics, and its use is economically viable.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36543/26872,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Ecosystem services and production systems of family cattle farms: an analysis of animal production in Pampa Biome,"This paper aims at discussing the beef cattle production system, related to ecosystem services, to emphasize the case of Associação de Produtores do Rincão do Vinte e Oito (Association of Rincão do Vinte e Oito Producers). The main objective is to analyze the offer of ecosystem services in the Ibirapuitã Environmental Protection Area (EPA), regarding the beef cattle production and sheep farming in the natural grassland. A case study with nine producers of the Association, considered as an analysis unit, was conducted in 2017 through semi-structured interviews. According to the producers, the preservation of animal production was valid, as they believed that it can provide welfare for their families and the remaining population. The respondents mentioned that, in the past, the tradition of producing beef cattle and sheep was very strong in the region, but nowadays, besides the tradition, they produce for profit, to be able to remain in rural areas. Beef cattle through the ecosystem supply service providers food for the population through meat production and sheep farming through meat and wool. Although the main theme of the research is directly related to the provisioning services, mainly focusing on beef cattle in the natural grassland, the cultural ecosystem services were widely cited during the research. The interviewers strongly highlighted the preservation of the traditional activities, conducted since the early days of occupation of the territory of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the issues related to the preservation of the environment in which they live, the solidarity between the producers, and the natural grassland maintenance. Moreover, the observed landscapes indicated that the maintenance of rural agroecosystems in the region was preserved, thus putting even more emphasis on the range of ecosystem regulatory services.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36777/26879,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Brazilian panorama of pig breeding sector: a cross-sectional study about specific aspects of biosecurity, facilities, management, feeding, and performance","The objective of this study was to identify the degree of adoption of different production factors in commercial pig breeding farms in Brazil. Data were collected from 150 farms, totaling 135,168 sows, including general information, labor, genetics, biosecurity, facilities, management, feeding and productive performance for the year 2015. The farms were located in the South (42%), Southeast (45.3%) and Midwest (12.7%) of Brazil. The amplitude of the herds varied between 100 and 6,360 productive sows, with an average of 901. Their predominant profile was independent production with hired labor, an average of 88 sows per employee, facilities with more than 15 years and no reform in the last decade, and located less than 5 km from other units. Animal replacement was performed mainly by purchase and without adoption of a quarantine period. Predominated farms housed the sows in crates in the pre-mating period and in pens or crates/pens during gestation. Both solid and slatted floors were used in these phases, predominantly using concrete as material; the use of slatted floors (either concrete, metal, or plastic) predominated in the farrowing facilities. Gutter-type feeders that also operated as water drinkers were predominant in the pre-mating and gestation periods; in farrowing facilities wet-dry feeders were widespread. Two-thirds of the farms did not have a cooling system in farrowing facilities. For the piglets, the heating system above the animal (lamps and bell rings) prevailed to the detriment of heat floors. More than 60% of farms make their own feed and feed gestating sows once a day. Only 29.33% of the farms perform echography for diagnosis of gestation. Birth attendance was routine; however, one-third of the farms did not have attendance through the night. Batch weaning was practiced by 15.44% of the farms. More than half of the farms reported that they did not intervene in the colostrum supply of piglets born weak or small, but 95.33% piglets were transferred among litters considering their size and quantity. Teeth resection, tail docking, and surgical castration procedures were routine. The performance indexes were consistent with what is perceived by national surveys.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36625/26905,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Productive and reproductive performance of Holstein cows in Agreste, Pernambuco, from 2007 to 2017","The aim of this study was to assess the productive and reproductive performance of Holstein cows grown in the Agreste region of Pernambuco. Dairy records were collected from three farms located in the Agreste region of the state of Pernambuco each month between 2007 and 2017. According to the National Institute of Meteorology the average annual temperature during the collection period was 24.21 ºC, mean annual rainfall was 551.7 mm and mean annual relative humidity was 75.92%. A total of 42,677 data points concerning milk production, milk components and somatic cell score (SCS), as well as other zootechnical information regarding reproductive management, are analyzed herein. In order to assess cow productive performance, lactation curve estimates were performed according to calving order by applying the Wood model, while milk production, milk components and SCS were analyzed according to calving order and farm, season, calving year and the interaction between calving order and season. Regarding reproductive evaluations, farm effects on indices such as age at first calving (IPP), calving interval (IP) and service period (PS) were evaluated. Data were processed using analysis of variance SAS PROC GLM commands, while PROC NLIN commands were used to estimate the curves. Significant (p < 0.05) farm, calving order, season, calving year and interaction effects on production values, milk composition and SCS were noted. Higher amounts of certain milk components (lactose, total solids and non-fat solids) were observed in primiparous cows. Multiparous cows were the most productive in relation to the amount of milk produced milk (34.15 kg/milk/day) and, consequently, presented the highest SCS (4.48). The Wood model showed a good fit of lactation curve characterized by an ascending phase until peaking and a descending phase following the peak. Regarding the assessed reproductive indices, a significant effect (p < 0.05) of farm was observed on IP and PS. The parameters calving order, farm, season, year of calving, interaction between calving order and season, as well as the effect of farm on reproductive indices (IP and PS) are the most important factors in the evaluation of production and milk quality of cows raised in semiarid environments.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36592/26873,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Chemical composition, kinetics of degradation, and digestibility of forage of different purpose sorghum cultivars","The aim of the study was to identify suitability of different purpose sorghum cultivars for silage production and for green chopping, at the first and second season, based on the chemical composition and degradation kinetics. The experiment was based on a randomized block design with four replicates, with sowing in the months of November and March, as the first and second season, respectively. The trial was conducted at the Plant Production Sector of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rondônia, Colorado do Oeste campus, and chemical analyses were performed at the Animal Nutrition Laboratory of the Federal University of Mato Grosso, Cuiaba campus. The treatments comprised six sorghum hybrids of different purposes (BRS 308 and BRS 310, grain sorghum; BRS 655 and BRS 610, forage sorghum; BRS 506 and CMSXS 647, sweet sorghum). The chemical composition, digestibility, and kinetic parameters were evaluated. At the first season, there was a higher digestibility (P < 0.0001) for sweet sorghum BRS 506, while for the second season, both grain sorghum BRS 308 and sweet sorghum cultivars BRS 506 and CMSXS 647 presented higher digestibility (P = 0.0005). Considering the nutritional value, all sorghum cultivars have the potential to produce silage, or to be used as green chop, at the first and second season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36691/26891,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Forage production and nutritional quality at different development stages of black oat,"The present study evaluated the agronomic productive and qualitative traits of black oat (Avena strigosa) forage harvested at different developmental stages for haylage production. This was a 2 x 3 factorial randomized complete block design consisting of six treatments, two stages of development of the crop (vegetative and full vegetative) associated with three harvest seasons, with four replications: T1 - vegetative stage, first cut, when light interception reached values between 90 and 95 %; T2 - vegetative stage with harvest seven days after the first cut; T3 - vegetative stage with harvest fourteen days after the first cut; T4 - full vegetative stage, second cut, when again the light interception reached values between 90 and 95 %; T5 - full vegetative stage with harvest seven days after the second cut; and T6 - full vegetative stage with harvest fourteen days after the second cut. The first cut at the vegetative stage of black oat generated a larger dry biomass production with 2.478 kg ha-1 and a greater participation of green leaves compared to the second cut at the full vegetative stage, as well as the in situ degradability of green leaves and the stem was higher in the first cut. The delay of 7 or 14 days from the ideal harvest time of the black oat forage reduced the nutritional quality. The first cut at the vegetative stage resulted in higher dry biomass production, greater participation of green leaves in the dry matter and better digestibility of green leaves and stem compared to the second cut at the full vegetative stage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36765/26878,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Fitting of fixed regression curves with different residual variance structures for Nellore cattle growth modeling,"Different polynomial functions were tested for mean trajectory modeling with different residual variance structures. A total of 15,148 weight records of 3,115 Nellore Mocho cattle with ages between 1 and 660 days, raised in northern Brazil. First, the mean trajectory of cattle growth curve was fitted by a fixed regression using orthogonal polynomials with orders ranging from two to seven. Analyses were performed using the least-squares method, disregarding animal and/ or maternal random effects. Then, the best model was evaluated using different residual variance structures and homogeneous and heterogeneous classes. We considered as fixed effects those of groups of contemporary and of dam age at birth (as linear and quadratic covariate). The random model part included animal and maternal effects (direct genetic and permanent environments). We concluded that the estimates of variance components and genetic parameters were affected by both fixed regression curve polynomial order and residual variance structure. Moreover, random regression model considering an order-four polynomial function with a fixed curve and six-class residual variance showed better fits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36531/26870,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Effect of obesity on ecocardiographic parameters and vertebral heart size (VHS) in cats,"The objective of this study was to correlate cardiovascular parameters with obesity in adult cats. Forty mixed-breed cats (20 obese and 20 controls) underwent echocardiographic measurements and thoracic radiography to establish a relationship between the obtained data and the body condition score (BCS), body mass index (BMI), and vertebral heart size (VHS). Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) was also studied in 15 obese cats. Compared to the control cats, obese cats presented higher VHS values across several measurements, but among the echocardiographic parameters, only the difference in the left ventricular free wall at diastole was statistically significant. A positive relationship was established between body weight, left ventricular internal diameter at diastole, and left ventricular free wall at diastole. Positive relationships were also observed between BMI and diameter of the aorta, BCS and the left ventricular free wall at diastole, VHS and the left atrium, and the left atrial to aortic root diameter ratio and the left ventricular internal diameter at diastole. SAP was higher in obese cats and presented a positive correlation with body weight. Obesity correlated with an increase in SAP and with some echocardiographic and radiographic cardiac measurements in adult cats. Further studies are needed to better assess the effects of obesity on the cardiovascular system of cats and to reassess the parameters related to body weight and condition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34572/26906,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Proposal of a metric selection index for correspondence analysis: an application in the sensory evaluation of coffee blends,"Correspondence analysis is a multivariate dimensionality-reduction technique applied to data structured into contingency tables. The main outcome of this approach is the generation of perceptual maps aimed at the study of similarity between categorical levels. In most cases, interpretations of these similarities present subjectivity when different metrics are considered; e.g., Hellinger distance and Chi-square. Thus, in an attempt to minimize this subjectivity, the present study proposes an index that quantifies the shortest distance between those levels. A simulation study was undertaken in which the generated maps were discussed in relation to real data involving the similarity of blends formed by coffees of different species, with sensory evaluations considering the flavor and acidity attributes. In conclusion, the proposed index—named metric selection index (MSI)—made it possible to include a statistic that justifies the most suitable metric for correspondence analysis, thus preventing subjectivity in interpretations of similarities between blend types and grade classes. In the simulation studies, with the metric proposed by Hellinger distance, MSI showed stabler results regarding total inertia distribution on the first two axes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36659/26865,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Clinical parameters of goats infected with gastrointestinal nematodes and treated with condensed tannin,"Small ruminants are affected by gastrointestinal nematodes that cause great economic losses in sheep and goat farming. Alternatives have been studied to control these parasites, such as the use of taniniferous plants; however, few studies have reported the effects of condensed tannins on blood parameters. This study aimed to verify the effect of condensed tannin for the treatment of goats infected by gastrointestinal nematodes on hematological, biochemical, and serum protein parameters. Blood samples were collected weekly from 24 six-month-old male Boer goats experimentally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes weighing 15 ± 2.5 kg live weight and reared in a feedlot system for 28 days. The animals were divided into four groups of six animals, one group was treated with Mimosa caesalpiniifolia condensed tannin (CT), the second group was treated with CT and polyethylene glycol (CT + PEG), the third group was treated with 5 mg kg-1 BW-1 monepantel (positive control), and the fourth group did not receive any treatment (negative control). The results obtained for erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total plasma protein showed no statistically significant differences among the groups, and neither did the biochemical variables alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, glucose, iron, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Proteinogram data were evaluated, including total protein, albumin, ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, and ?1-acid glycoprotein. There was no statistically significant difference among the groups for ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, and ?1-acid glycoprotein. Therefore, the treatment of goats infected by gastrointestinal nematodes with M. caesalpiniifolia CT did not interfere in hematological, biochemical, and serum protein parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36569/26868,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Evaluation of two strategies for reducing the spread of Salmonella in commercial swine herds during the finishing phase and their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios,"To achieve control of Salmonella contamination in pig carcasses, on-farm measures need to be better understood. Complementary strategies require research not only on their effectiveness but also on their financial impact. In this study, we evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of two treatments for reducing Salmonella seroprevalence in commercial swine herds. Pigs treated with a prebiotic or a vaccine were studied and compared with pigs in an untreated control group. Each strategy was applied to three batches of pigs in a commercial integration system; the animals were followed from farrowing to the slaughterhouse, and their serologies upon arrival at finishing farms and before slaughter were evaluated. Additionally, carcass surface contamination was assessed for each strategy. The seroprevalence upon arrival at the finishing farm was lower than 3% in all groups. In the control and vaccine groups, the seroprevalence increased by more than 90 percentage points from the day of arrival at the finishing farm to four days before slaughter. Only the prebiotic treatment yielded a significant effect on preslaughter seroprevalence (a 49 percentage points reduction from that in the control). Carcass contamination was 0% in the prebiotic group, 18.33% in the control group and 29.16% in the vaccine group. Only prebiotics significantly reduced the seroprevalence of Salmonella in the studied herds, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with prebiotic use was 1.92 USD to reduce seroprevalence by 10 percentage points per carcass ton.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36085/26867,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,"Epidemiological characterization and risk factors associated with Brucella ovis infection in sheep from the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, and Sergipe","This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ovine brucellosis in the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, and Sergipe. A seroepidemiological survey was carried out in 121 properties under 23 municipalities between 2011 and 2012. The 1,034 serological samples collected from the sheep were subjected to the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test using kits produced by the Paraná Institute of Technology (TECPAR). Anti-Brucella ovis antibodies were observed in 5.37% (70/1,304) of the animals evaluated, and the difference in the incidence of brucellosis between the adults and young animals of both sexes, and between the males and females was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The prevalence of brucellosis in Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, and was Sergipe 7.66% (36/470), 5.40% (13/241) and 3.54% (21/593), respectively. Of the municipalities visited, 91.30% (21/23) harbored herds with positive serology, and 42.15% (51/121) of the properties had at least one seropositive animal. The lack of training among the workers (p ? 0.05) (odds ratio = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.08-12.60; p = 0.038) was identified as a risk factor. The results obtained in this study indicate that the sheep from Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, and Sergipe are infected by B. ovis, thus necessitating the adoption of proper sanitary measures for preventing the spread of the disease in the herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36905/26869,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Silicon as an acidity corrective associated with Azospirillum brasilense to improve nitrogen management and wheat profitability,"This research aimed to study a possible synergistic effect with inoculation with A. brasilense and N doses, associated with the application of silicon in acidity corrective form, evaluating the grain yield of irrigated wheat in Cerrado region. The experiment was conducted in Selvíria, MS, Brazil, under a no-till system, on a Latossolo Vermelho distrófico (Oxisol). The experiment was set up as a randomized block design with four replications, in a 2 × 5 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of two soil corrective sources (dolomitic limestone and Ca and Mg silicate as source of Si); five N doses (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha-1) applied in topdressing; and with and without inoculation with A. brasilense. Inoculation makes wheat production more profitable, irrespective of N doses and corrective sources. The N dose of 139 kg ha-1 with dolomitic limestone associated with inoculation of A. brasilense provided the greatest grain yield. However, the highest economic return was obtained at the N dose of 100 kg ha-1, with dolomitic limestone application and inoculation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36045/26863,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Azospirillum inoculation of 'Marandu' palisade grass seeds: effects on forage production and nutritional status,"Plant-growth-promoting bacteria can be used for sustainable forage grass production while increasing nutrition and biomass. Most of the soils under pasture in the tropics have a degradation level that impairs the forage yield potential, especially because of mismanagement and lack of fertilization. The objective of this work was to evaluate the seed inoculation effects of Azospirillum brasilense on the shoot and root dry mass production and nutritional status of Urochloa brizantha cv. ‘Marandu’ under field conditions for two years in a low-fertility soil. The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications, arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial scheme, comprised of two doses of A. brasilense (0 and 200 mL ha-1) in combination with three doses of N (0, 25 and 50 kg ha-1). Seed inoculation increased shoot dry mass by 13% in the first year and by 6% in the second year, whereas N application increased dry mass by 27% and 35% in the first and second year, respectively. The concentration of nutrients in the shoots did not change due to the inoculation, but N fertilization affected P, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn in the first year and N, P and Cu in the second year. Root dry mass increased 36% with fertilization of 25 kg N ha-1 plus inoculation in relation to the other treatments in the first year. In the second year, the inoculation of A. brasilense increased by 17%. Therefore, seed inoculation of Urochloa brizantha cv. ‘Marandu’ with Azospirillum brasilense increased root and shoot dry mass production in some cuts without influencing tiller numbers. Nitrogen fertilization altered N, Mg, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu concentrations in shoot dry mass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/36211/26892,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Remote sensing as a tool to determine biophysical parameters of irrigated seed corn crop,"In recent years, many studies have been conducted combining orbital remote sensing data and crop growth models for vegetation monitoring, evapotranspiration estimation and quantification of biophysical parameters, e.g., NDVI, surface temperature, albedo, and biomass. The aim of the present study was to estimate evapotranspiration (ETr), biomass (BIO), and water productivity (WP) for irrigated seed corn crop using the SAFER algorithm and Landsat 8 satellite images. For this, eight cloud-free images were acquired at different phenological stages over the interest area on the United States Geological Survey website and meteorological data. ETr was estimated by the SAFER algorithm, BIO by the Monteith model, and WP by the BIO/ETr ratio. ETr values ranged from 0 to 6 mm d?1, with the highest values coinciding with the period of high vegetative crop vigor, while the lowest values were found at the sowing season. The highest biomass values were observed from images at 46 and 62 days after sowing (DAS), corresponding to 286 and 289 kg ha?1 d?1, respectively. The highest mean of water productivity was observed at 62 DAS, with 6.9 kg m?3 of water, corresponding to the period of maximum vegetative crop vigor. The application of the SAFER model together with Landsat 8 satellite images was an alternative to identifying the spatial and temporal variation of biophysical parameters of the corn crop. It could assist in the management of water in irrigated agriculture and decision making in large-sized farms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/35036/26862,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Corn hybrid silage quality according to harvesting time,"The present study aimed to evaluate the dry matter production of different corn hybrids, the plant chemical composition at the time of ensiling and the participation of the structural components of the plant at the different phenological stages. Corn hybrids P2530, P30B39H and P30R50H were harvested successively at the kernel blister (R2); kernel milk (R3); kernel dough (R4); and kernel dent (R5) stages. We determined the dry matter contents, the percentage participation of each physical structure of the plant at the time of each evaluation, as well as the first ear height, plant height, number of dry leaves, production of dry ensilable phytomass, grain and chemical composition at the time of ensiling (kernel dent stage, R5). There was no difference (p > 0.05) in dry phytomass production between the evaluated hybrids. In general, the hybrid P30R50H, considering dry biomass production and fiber composition of the plant and relative value of the food was balanced for silage. The advance of the stages provided an increase in the grain participation and consequent reduction of the other components in the physical composition of the plant, and the R4 stage was the moment of best association between productivity and physical composition of the plant for silage production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32708/26857,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Cultivation of West Indian cherry irrigated with saline water under phosphorus and nitrogen proportions,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of water salinity and phosphorus:nitrogen ratios on growth, leaf macronutrients and sodium and the West Indian cherry production. The research was carried out in a protected environment, in lysimeters filled with a Regolithic Neosol of loamy clay texture and low initial phosphorus content. The experiment was carried out in a protected environment, in a randomized complete block design with treatments arranged in a 5 × 4 factorial scheme, with differing electrical conductivity levels of the irrigation water ECw (0.6, 1.4, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.8 dS m-1) and four proportions of phosphorus and nitrogen P/N (100:100, 140:100, 100:140 and 140:140% of P/N), with three replicates and one plant per replicate. Phosphorus and nitrogen doses corresponding to 100% of the recommendation for phosphate and nitrogen fertilization were 45.0 g of P2 O5 per plant year and 23.85 g of N per plant year, respectively. The West Indian cherry plants were maintained under irrigation with saline water for 365 days, where they were evaluated the growth characteristics, foliar mineral composition, and production. The increase of the salinity of irrigation water increases the levels of sodium in the tissues to levels detrimental to growth, foliar mineral composition and the production of the West Indian cherry. Fertilization with 140% of the phosphorus and nitrogen recommendation inhibits the action of saline stress, promoting greater production of West Indian cherry irrigated water plants with water up to 3.0 dS m-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33373/26859,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Agronomic characterization and chemical composition of sorghum hybrids for silage making in rainfed conditions,"The sorghum crop stands out in animal feeding, as this feedstuff can be preserved still fresh in the form of silage. This study was conducted to determine the agronomic characterization and chemical composition of sorghum hybrids in rainfed conditions aiming at silage production. Twenty-five sorghum hybrids were used in a randomized-block experimental design with three replicates. The following variables were evaluated: number of tillers; plant height; percentages of leaf, stem, panicle, grain and dead material; leaf:stem ratio; live:dead material ratio; total fresh matter yield; total dry matter yield; yields of leaf, stem, panicle, grain and dead material (in t ha-1 DM); and chemical composition. Data were analyzed by the Scott-Knott procedure at the 5% significance level. The greatest observed heights were 214.53, 229.00 and 240.07 cm, found in hybrids SF15, SF25 and PROG134IPA, respectively. There was an effect for morphological characterization (P < 0.001), with the best means observed in hybrids 9929030 and 9929026. The highest total fresh matter yields were found in SF15, SF11, 12F042150 (93.95, 82.61 and 79.27 t ha-1, respectively). Adequate dry matter contents for ensiling were observed in hybrids 9929030, 12F042224, 12F042150, FEPAGRO18, FEPAGRO19, FEPAGRO11, SF15, SF25, 1141572, 1141570 and BRS Ponta Negra.

41,2020,Characteristics of the root system in two Brazilian upland rice varieties which exhibit contrasting behavior towards drought tolerance,"Root system architecture plays a fundamental role in the adaptation of rice to environments subjected to abiotic stresses. This study aimed to characterize the root architecture and morphology of two Brazilian upland rice varieties which display contrasting behavior towards drought tolerance: the tolerant Catetão and susceptible Mira varieties. Two experiments were carried out under greenhouse and growth chamber conditions. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme (varieties × drought stress conditions) with four replicates. Rice varieties were subjected to control and drought conditions for 14 days. Drought stress was applied either by withholding water until the desirable soil tension was achieved or by addition of 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) to the nutritive solution. After harvest, the dry weight, root architecture, as well as physiological and root features were assessed. Under drought stress, a higher root biomass was recorded in Catetão compared to Mira. A higher ratio of deep rooting (RDR) was observed for Catetão, while Mira remained stable in response to drought stress. The evaluated physiological features showed that the Catetão variety is less likely to compromise membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation during drought stress. Moreover, analyzed root features exhibited a significant increase in lateral root emission and root density for Catetão in response to drought treatment, which may be considered an important feature when selecting for superior genotypes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33708/26861,E-ISSN 1679-0359
41,2020,Genotype-environment interaction on baby corn production,"The phase of genotype evaluation for recommendation in different environments is seen as the key stage of breeding programs, in view of the importance of the genotype – environment interaction on the main traits. The objective of this study was to evaluate different field corn, popcorn, white corn, and sweet corn genotypes for their capacity of baby corn production and the genotype - environment interaction. Twenty-nine genotypes were evaluated, in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experiments were performed in the main and second season in Rio Verde – GO and in the second season in Maringá – PR. Significant (p < 0.05) differences between the genotypes were observed for all evaluated traits. The genotype - environment interaction was only significant for mean ear diameter, prolificacy and ear yield, indicating a differentiated performance between genotypes in response to environmental variations. The predominance of the complex part of interaction on prolificacy and yield is emphasized. Although the baby corn harvest is performed even before ear fertilization, the results suggests that the variations in the traits related with babycorn production and quality are mainly influenced by genetic-environmental factors. The genotypes P30K64, HD 332, IPR 119, and IAC 125 obtained the highest means for the evaluated traits. The groups of white and field corn genotypes stood out for with a significantly better performance than the others, principally for ear yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33311/26858,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Radiographic imaging revealed a complete comminuted diaphyseal femur fracture, which was corrected through intramedullary pin placement along with plate osteosynthesis. After two months the animal returned to the hospital presenting severe diffuse enlargement of the left hindlimb, characterized as a non-delimited, solid, and firm plaque-like mass surrounding the pin and bone, which extended from the femorotibiopatelar joint to the pelvis, and infiltrated the adjacent musculature. Incisional biopsy exam indicated a highly malignant sarcoma. The entire limb was surgically removed and sent to histopathological evaluation. Microscopically, the mass was composed of spindle shaped cells, displaying high pleomorphism and cellular atypia. Abundant collagen production was evidenced through Masson's trichrome stain and strong cytoplasmic staining for vimentin. These results were consistent with fibrosarcoma.

Marandu. fertilised with low and high doses of nitrogen (N). The design was completely randomised, in a subdivided plot scheme, with four replications. Leaf appearance rate (LAR) and leaf elongation rate (LER) were higher in young tillers than in old ones. At the beginning of the deferment period, the canopy under high N doses had higher LAR and LER values. At the end of the deferment period, we observed no difference between the doses of N for LAR. The stem elongation rate was higher at the beginning than at the end of the deferment period, while the leaf senescence rate (LSR) was higher at higher N doses when compared to lower doses. The highest LSR values and leaf lifespan were observed at the end of the deferment period. The greatest number of young tillers occurred at the beginning of the deferment period and with the highest N dose. In this sense, higher N doses, applied during the active growth period and before the deferment period, favour he maintenance of a larger number of young tillers, which have a greater growth potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34633/25941,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Zeolite inclusion in dog extruded diets: digestibility, fecal characteristics, and palatability","Addition of zeolite to caninedietscan improve fecal characteristics, reducing its moisture and odor. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an increasing dietary inclusion of zeolite on nutrient and energy digestibility, fecal characteristics, and diet palatability for dogsfed diets containing high soybean meal level. Two experiments were performed. The first experiment evaluated the effect of increasing concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 g/kg) of zeolite (clinoptilolite) in extruded dog foods on diet digestibility and fecal quality. Six adult dogs were distributed to treatments arranged in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. The second assessed the effect of 20 or 50 g clinoptilolite per kg of diet on food palatability, where in 20 dogs were distributedinto two tests, in a completely randomized experimental design (0 vs.20 g/kg and 0 vs. 50 g/kg zeolite). Despite the small variation, dietary zeolite inclusion reduced diet metabolizable energy content (15.4 to 14.7 MJ/kg, P < 0.05) and the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility of dry matter (0.773 to 0.740, P < 0.05). Fecal dry matter (fDM) content increased as zeolite concentrations increased (30.4% to 36.1%, P < 0.05), but fecal score had no effect. Zeolite concentrations caused no changes (P > 0.05) in ammonia nitrogen, sialic acid, fecal pH,or diet palatability.The inclusion of up to 50 g natural clinoptilolite per kg of diet increases fDM content, maintains adequate fecal score and has no negative impact on diet palatability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34607/25940,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Technological indicators and productive performance of dairy cattle farming in the city of Rondon do Pará, state of Pará, Brazilian Amazon","The objective of this study was to evaluate the technological level and productive performance of the milk producing units of the municipality of Rondon do Pará in the state of Pará. Data were collected through interviews with questionnaires, conducted at 55 dairy farms, which accounted for 43.3% of the milked cows in the municipality. The factors that characterize the systems of bovine milk production were estimated by means of factorial analysis using 12 variables representative of the production units surveyed. Five factors were extracted: F1 = size of the enterprise; F2 = environment and nutrition; F3 = technical assistance and herd management; F4 = animal health; F5 = schooling. From the scores associated with each factor, the index for productive performance of dairy cattle (DFPI) was calculated. The properties were classified into three levels of productive performance, including two considered to have a high level of DFPI, 16 with intermediate productive performance and 37 considered to have a low level of DFPI. There is a need to adopt technologies that promote the productive performance of dairy cattle in Rondon do Pará, as well as enable adaptation to socio-environmental public policies, with the aim of strengthening sustainable rural production through strategic actions that facilitate an increased technological level in farming systems production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34592/25957,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Application of low dose of equine chorionic gonadotropin at acupoint Hou Hai for fixed-time artificial insemination in beef cows,"This study evaluated the efficiency application of low dose of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) using Hou Hai acupoint for fixed-term artificial insemination (FTAI) in beef cows. Seventy cows received intravaginal devices with progesterone, and 3 mg of estradiol benzoate on day zero (D0) of FTAI. On D9, the devices were removed, and 150 ?g of prostaglandin F2? was applied; the animals were then randomly distributed to three treatment groups: T1 (n = 23), 300 IU of eCG intramuscularly (IM); T2 (n = 23), 90 IU of eCG at acupoint Hou Hai; and T3 (n = 25), 90 IU of eCG at false acupoint IM. On D10, the animals received 1 mg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone IM, and FTAI was performed, 52 h after the devices were removed. The quantitative variables with normal distribution were assessed using analysis of variance at 5% probability. For variables that did not show normal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis test at 5% probability was used. No significant difference was noted among the groups (P > 0.05) for the interval between device withdrawal at ovulation (58.2 ± 12.2 h), diameter of the largest follicle on D9 (9.9 ± 2.2 mm), diameters of the ovulatory follicle (12.2 ± 3.0 mm) and the second largest follicle (6.7 ± 2.1 mm), follicular growth rate (0.8 ± 0.3 mm/d), ovulation rate (82%), corpus luteum size (2.32 ± 0.35 cm2), and pregnancy rate (58.67%). The protocol cost per animal was US$ 10.67 (T1) and US$ 8.50 (T2 and T3). The use of 90 IU of eCG applied at Hou Hai acupoint or at false acupoint caused satisfactory synchronization of estrus in beef cows. In addition, this procedure was cost-effective.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34108/25937,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Supplementation of cows with linseed: effects on antral follicle count, oocyte quality, and nutritional and plasma metabolite parameters","Linseed is distinguished by its composition of fatty acids, which are rich in unsaturated acids, and by the slow release of oil in the rumen, consequently providing a greater amount of lipids of interest for intestinal absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of linseed supplementation on the antral follicle count (AFC) and oocyte quality of Girolando cows, as well as their digestive parameters and plasma metabolite. Twelve Girolando cows were used in the study and were randomly distributed in two experimental groups: control (CTL, n = 6) and linseed (LINS, n = 6). During the 126 days of supplementation, seven transvaginal ultrasound-guided ovum pick-up (OPU) sessions were performed at intervals of 21 days. AFC was performed in each OPU session. The cows fed with linseed showed no significant difference in the dry matter coefficient of digestibility (63.11 and 62.88), crude protein (62.7 and 55.26), neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 75.36 and 77.15), or acid detergent fiber (ADF; 72.45 and 74.77) for LINS and CTL, respectively. On the contrary, a higher level of ethereal extract was observed for LINS (69.31 vs. 40.7). There was no effect (p > 0.05) of lipid supplementation on plasma metabolite between groups and OPU sessions. There was no difference (p > 0.05) in the mean number of antral follicles (CTL: 31.14 ± 1.97; LINS: 25.52 ± 2.68), cumulus oocyte complexes recovered (CTL: 6.45 ± 1.66; LINS: 5.28 ± 1.18), or oocyte quality (CTL: 60.48% ± 8.46; LINS: 64.54% ± 7.77).

40,2019,Characterization of gelatins from Nile tilapia skins preserved by freezing and salting,"After Nile tilapia skin was preserved using the methods of freezing and dry salting, characteristics of skin gelatin were evaluated with regard to yield, rheological features and physical and chemical properties. Preservation was performed after filleting, at which time skins were either frozen (-18°C) for 7 days or salted (25°C) for 7 days. Although no differences (p > 0.05) were observed with respect to humidity, protein, lipid, ash and calcium levels, gelatin from salted skins had a higher concentration of iron relative to frozen skins. Further, twenty-three fatty acids were detected in salted skins compared with merely three found in skin derived gelatin. Of amino acids found, glycine, alanine, proline and arginine were the most abundant. Hydroxyproline abundance in salted and frozen skin gelatin were 8.76% and 8.71%, respectively. In addition, salted skin gelatins had a greater accumulation of saturated fatty acids and lower rates of monounsaturated fatty acids.

40,2019,"Influence of nitrogen, environment, and cultivars on the industrial quality of wheat","The quality of wheat is a pre-eminent factor in the criteria for commercialization of this cereal, and several parameters contribute to the evaluation of wheat quality. The objective of this study was to verify the effects of nitrogen fertilization on the cover and the environment for wheat cultivars and the effects on the industrial quality of the grain. Furthermore, we sought to identify correlations between the parameters of industrial quality. Experiments were conducted in Londrina for 2 years, in two distinct environments (A1 and A2). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with four replications. The cultivars IPR Catuara TM, BRS Gaivota, Quartzo, and CD 120 were evaluated with different forms of nitrogen management: N1, without N in coverage; N2, 60 kg ha-1 of N in the form of urea at the beginning of tillering; N3, 80 kg ha-1 of N in urea formulation (60 kg ha-1 in tillering and 20 kg ha-1 in booting); N4, 100 kg ha-1 of N in the form of urea (60 kg ha-1 in tillering and 40 kg ha-1 in booting); N5, 80 kg ha-1 of N (60 kg ha-1 of N in the form of urea at the beginning of tillering, and 20 kg ha-1 of N in the form of ammonium sulfate in booting); N6, 100 kg ha-1 of N (60 kg ha-1 of N in the form of urea at the beginning of tillering, and 40 kg ha-1 of N in the form of ammonium sulfate in booting). Further, we evaluated grain yield, protein content, sedimentation volume with sodium dodecyl sulfate, and parameters of alveograph and farinograph. Nitrogen fertilization did not influence industrial quality parameters. The stability of the mass was influenced by the isolated effects of cultivars and the environment. The interaction of cultivars and environments influenced the parameters of alveograph and water absorption of the mass. The higher the protein content, the lower the stability of the mass, independent of the cultivar.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34203/25932,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Outbreak of Clostridium perfringens type D enterotoxemia in sheep,"This work describes the first Brazilian laboratory-confirmed outbreak of enterotoxemia caused by Clostridium perfringens type D in sheep, which occurred in the state of Paraná. We address the epidemiological aspects involved, the diagnostic modalities employed, and the clinical signs and pathological findings observed. Eight healthy pregnant female sheep with no history of vaccination for clostridiosis presented with a history of abrupt feeding changes and neurological manifestations that quickly evolved to illness, coma and death. Four other females with clinical neurological signs were referred to the Veterinary Hospital of the Universidade Federal do Paraná, Palotina Sector. These animals presented with lethargy, motor incoordination, opisthotonus, pedal movements, muscle tremors, spastic paralysis, bruxism, mandibular trismus, sialorrhea, hyperexcitability and the inability to stand. They were examined and euthanized due to the seriousness of the clinical picture with an unfavorable prognosis. We performed gross anatomical and microscopic analyses of the organs and intestinal contents. We also performed bacterial isolation with molecular typing. From the intestinal contents, we detected toxins by means of the seroneutralization technique in mice. At necropsy, we noted pulmonary edema (2/4), necrotizing enteritis (4/4) and hyperemia of the leptomeninges (1/4). Microscopically, we observed lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia, necrotic enteritis associated with the presence of rods, and nephrosis with interstitial lymphohistiocytic nephritis. No significant brain lesions were observed. Using serum neutralization, we identified epsilon toxin in the intestinal contents of all four animals. C. perfringens type D was identified. Based on the history, clinical signs, postmortem findings, and laboratory confirmation of the presence of epsilon toxin, we concluded that C. perfringens type D enterotoxemia caused this outbreak of sheep deaths.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32883/25934,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment was carried out in greenhouse in Nova Odessa/SP, Brazil, from August to December 2015. A 52 fractional factorial design with 13 combinations for doses of phosphorus and calcium in mg dm-3: 0-0; 0-40; 0-80; 15-20; 15-60; 30-0; 30-40; 30-80; 45-20; 45-60; 60-0; 60-40; 60-80, in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Two cuttings were made on the plants. The phosphorus x calcium interaction and the isolated doses of calcium were not significant for the parameters assessed. The production of dry biomass of the aerial part, the leaf area, the number of leaves and the number of branches of Macrotyloma showed significant responses to the isolated doses of phosphorus applied in the primary growth. In the secondary growth, only the number of branches and the dry biomass production of the dead material responded to the doses of phosphorus. Phosphorus was a modulator of dry biomass production of roots and of the production of nodules and the number of nodules of macrotyloma. The content of calcium present in the soil, together with the increase of the value of base saturation to 50%, was sufficient for the establishment and growth of the legume. Therefore, a supplemental dose of this nutrient was not required.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34146/25931,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Shade nets and substrates in seedling production of Annona squamosa L. in the Roraima Cerrado,"Sugar apple (Annona squamosa L.) is one of the most widely grown member of the Annonaceae family in several regions, but there is still a lack of agronomic data regarding the management of its initial growth stages under Cerrado conditions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the production of Annona squamosa L. seedlings under different environmental conditions achieved by using shade nets (E1: ChromatiNet® Silver 50%; E2: ChromatiNet® red 50%; E3: ChromatiNet® red 35%; E4: ChromatiNet® Silver 35%) in combination with four different substrates (S1: soil + sand + chicken manure; S2: soil + sand + cattle manure; S3: soil + sand + cattle manure + chicken manure; S4: soil + sand + sheep manure). An experiment was set up using a completely randomized design with treatments in a split-plot arrangement, with four replicates and ten plants per experimental unit. Seedling growth parameters and quality indices were evaluated. The tested environments had higher local temperatures relative to the external environment, which had a negative effect on plant growth. Environment E2 resulted in the highest plant height and dry weight, but led to uneven growth among the evaluated plant parts. The substrate with sheep manure (S4) did not benefit seedling production. The best results for seedling growth and quality were obtained with substrates S2 (soil + sand + cattle manure) and S3 (soil + sand + cattle manure + chicken manure), which are therefore promising for Annona squamosa L. seedling production in the Roraima Cerrado.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34013/25976,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Clinical and molecular diagnosis of Chlamydophila in captive parrots in Pará State, Brazil","Parrots (Order Psittaciformes) are globally distributed birds that, together with members of the Columbiformes, represent the most susceptible animals, in regards to infection by Chlamydophila psittaci, which is an obligate, zoonotic, intracellular bacterium that causes chlamydiosis in domestic and wild birds and psittacosis in humans. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of C. psittaci in Brazilian psittacids kept in conservation breeding sites in Pará State, Brazil. Cloacal and oropharynx swab samples were collected from 201 psittacids that were distributed among four breeding sites: Metropolitan Area of Belém (C1 and C2), Northeastern Pará (C3), and Low Amazon (C4). The samples were screened for C. psittaci using semi-nested PCR, and the resulting incidence data were analyzed using proportion and chi-square tests. Chlamydophila infection was confirmed for all the breeding sites, with an overall prevalence of 31.84%, and no species-specific predisposition was observed. Furthermore, 13.93% of the sampled birds eliminated the infectious agent by the cloaca, whereas 11.44% eliminated the agent by the oropharynx, and 6.47% eliminated the agent by both routes. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the incidence of Chlamydophila infection of breeding sites C2 and C3 (p=0.029), which yielded the smallest and largest number of diagnosed cases, respectively. In the present study, most of the birds (27.86%) were considered unapparent carriers of Chlamydophila infection, and only 3.98% of the birds yielded both a positive diagnosis and clinical signs of chlamydiosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33434/25935,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Manganese toxicity in rice plants mitigated by silicon effects on leaf tissues,"Anatomical modifications of leaves and other organs associated with mineral nutrition have been observed in many plants. However, little is known about the quantitative effects of Si and Mn on the anatomy of plant leaves, especially in rice. This study aimed to quantify the tissue thickness of rice leaves and the density of silica bodies in rice leaves grown in a nutrient solution supplemented with Si and Mn and evaluate the possible effects of Si on Mn toxicity. Treatments were arranged in a 2×3 factorial scheme = six combinations of treatments, two doses of Si (0 and 2 mmol L-1), and three doses of Mn (0.5, 2.5, and 10 µmol L-1) in randomized complete block design with four replications. After 39 days in the nutrient solution with the respective treatments, anatomical and micromorphometric measures of the leaf blade were carried out to determine the thickness and area of leaf tissues. The data were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test of means(p?0,05). The abaxial and adaxial epidermal thickness, as well as the density of silica bodies increased with the addition of Si to the nutrient solution. This study demonstrated that Si reduced the number of vascular bundles and Mn reduced the thickness of the chlorenchyma with increasing doses. Manganese doses of up to 10 ?mol L-1 do not inhibit the uptake and deposition of silicon in rice leaf tissues. Higher Si concentration in the solution caused anatomical changes in the leaf, which was associated with a possible alleviation of Mn toxicity due to the higher concentration of Si in plants since this effect was observed mainly when Si was present in the nutrient solution.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33979/25928,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This fungus is capable of bioaccumulating metals in the mycelial biomass when cultured in the presence of them; however, this capacity is little explored for functional food production. This study aimed to evaluate the amount of iron or zinc bioaccumulated in the vegetative mycelium of sixteen strains of A. subrufescens. Mycelia were grown in malt extract agar added with 50 mg/L of iron or with 7.5 mg/L of zinc. The metal bioaccumulation in the mycelial biomass was strain-dependent. In general, metal can inhibit or stimulate the mycelial growth ranging from -81 to +78% for iron and from -86 to +100% for zinc. The highest bioaccumulated iron and zinc concentrations in the mycelial biomass was 2,595.65 mg/kg and 1,655.83 mg/kg, respectively and occurred in the U4-4 strain. The supplementation of mycelial biomass using iron or zinc is an alternative to develop food supplements, that can be used both in the human and animal diet and in the prevention of diseases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33941/25927,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In commercial fields in the region of Alto Paranaíba, MG, Brazil, onion plants of the cultivars ‘Optima’ and ‘Sirius’ were collected during the cycle in 2014 and 2015 to determine dry matter and macronutrient accumulation. The yield was determined at harvest time. Three phases of dry matter and nutrient accumulations were observed. The first phase had a slow accumulation and was followed by a fast increment and subsequent stabilization in phases two and three, respectively, for most of the nutrients in both cultivars and years of cultivation. Duration and accumulated at each phase were different between cultivars and years of cultivation. The total and commercial bulb yield did not vary between cultivars but only between years of cultivation, with average values of 117 and 60 Mg ha?1 in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The partitioning of dry matter and macronutrients followed the same model for both cultivars and years of cultivation. Macronutrients with the largest partitioning for bulbs are P and S. The decreasing extraction order for both cultivars was K > Ca > N > P > Mg > S in 2014 and K > N > Ca > P > S > Mg in 2015.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33935/25926,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Compatibility between entomopathogenic nematodes and crop protection products used in maize seed treatment,"Chemical insecticides are widely used to control soil pests but not always effective. Entomopathogenic nematodes (NEPs) are found in the soil and depend on host insects to complete their life cycle, and therefore have the potential to control soil pests. Thus, we aimed to investigate the possible joint use of these control methods by assessing the compatibility of two nematodes (Heterorhabditis amazonensis GL and Heterorhabditis amazonensis MC01) with five crop protection products used for maize seed treatment (Maxim®, Cruiser 350 FS®, Fortenza 600 FS®, Avicta 500 FS®, and Amulet®), as well as one neem-based product (NeenMax®). The experimental design was completely randomized with five replicates, six treatments, and one control, in which only distilled water was added to nematode suspension. Each replicate consisted of a test tube containing 1 mL suspension with 2,000 infective juveniles (IJs) and 1 mL of diluted product, following the manufacturer's recommendation. The evaluated parameters were viability, infectivity on Tenebrio molitor larvae and IJs production after exposure to products. Both nematodes were compatible with NeenMax® and Fortenza 600 FS® since they did not differ from the control and were classified as innocuous. Cruiser 350 FS ® was also compatible with the nematodes since the effect value of the product was lower than 30%. Amulet® was classified as slightly noxious, reducing H. amazonensis MC01 and H. amazonensis GL infectivity by 17.5% and 28.5%, and production by 18.2% and 22.3%, respectively. Despite not having reduced viability, Avicta 500 FS® and Maxim® were considered harmful. This is because Avicta 500 FS® and Maxim® reduced productivity by 70.0% and 72.5% and production by 66.1% and 65.4% for H. amazonensis MC01, respectively. For H. amazonensis MC01, both Avicta 500 FS® and Maxim® reduced infectivity by 76.19%, and production by 63.7% and 62.3%, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33789/25925,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Severity ranged between the minimal (0.5%) and maximal (55%) limits of disease severity, and intermediate severity levels were defined according to the ""Weber-Fechner stimulus response law"". The proposed scale describes six levels of severity based on how much of the leaf is affected: 0.5%, 3%, 8%, 23%, 36%, and 55%. Validation was carried out by eight evaluators, four inexperienced and four experienced. They estimated the severity of disease in 60 maize leaves, with and without the proposed diagrammatic scale. A relationship was shown by regression analysis between estimated and actual severity, with and without the use of the scale. When both inexperienced and experienced evaluators used the scale, they were able to estimate disease severity more accurately and precisely.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33561/25924,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Fatty acid composition of beef cattle finished on tropical pasture and supplemented with crude glycerin,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of crude glycerin supplementation on the chemical composition and fatty acid profile of the muscle of cattle grazing on Urochloa decumbens. Thirty-five crossbreed bulls, with an average initial body weight of 428.0 ± 32.11 kg, were supplemented with dry matter corresponding to 1% body weight for 74 days on pasture and distributed to five treatments (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12% low purity glycerin in the total dry matter of the supplement) in a completely randomised design. After 74 days, the animals were slaughtered, and the longissimus dorsi muscle was sampled and frozen for meat composition analysis. The addition of glycerin did not affect the mean moisture (73.6 ± 0.3%), protein (22.8 ± 0.4%), total lipid (1.1 ± 0.1%) and ash (1.0 ± 0.04%) contents of the animal muscle. However, there was an increasing linear effect (P < 0.05) on the contents of trans-vaccenic acid (increase of 175% in relation to the control) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (25% increase in relation to the control). We observed an increasing linear pattern in monounsaturated fatty acid levels (39.8 to 44.5%) and a decreasing linear pattern in polyunsaturated fatty acid content (13.5 to 9.5%). The inclusion of crude glycerin promoted a linear decreasing pattern for ?-3 fatty acids. Thus, the inclusion of crude glycerin in the supplement of beef cattle affects the fatty acid composition of the meat. The use of this byproduct promotes desirable changes in the chemical composition of fatty acids, increasing the levels of conjugated linoleic fatty acids (18: 2 c9 t11) and monounsaturated fatty acids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31357/25305,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Kidney disease in natural infection by Ehrlichia canis in dogs,"Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by the intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia canis, can affect different organs, including the kidneys, in different stages of infection, and kidney involvement is considered one of the main causes of death related to the disease. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of kidney disease in dogs naturally infected with E. canis and to correlate antibody levels with the severity of renal disease. Serum concentrations of urea, creatinine, and proteins (albumin and globulin), along with urine concentration, urine gamma-glutamyl transferase, and urine protein levels, were evaluated in 60 dogs with E. canis infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction. The detection of anti-E. canis antibodies was also performed for each dog. Of the 60 dogs with E. canis infection, 73.33% presented anti-E. canis antibodies. Laboratory abnormalities consistent with renal disease were observed in 33 (55%) infected dogs, and of these, 43.3% were in stage I chronic kidney disease. A positive correlation was observed between antibody levels and total plasma protein (p = 0.0332) and serum globulin (p = 0.0057) levels. In this study, renal disease was observed on routine laboratory testing in 55% of dogs with monocytic ehrlichiosis; however, there was no correlation between the stage of renal disease and the antibody titer against E. canis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32720/25281,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Effect of the environment and diet on the physiological variables of sheep in the Brazilian semi-arid region,"This study aimed to evaluate and compare the physiological variables of three sheep genotypes: Morada Nova, Somalis, and Dorper x Somalis crossbreed regarding the environment and diet in the Brazilian semi-arid region by using 30 animals (10 from each genetic group). Five of these animals had 30% of the tifton hay replaced by hairy woodrose hay. The temperature and relative air humidity were registered, the black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) was calculated, and the rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), and surface temperature (ST) were measured in the morning and afternoon. The experimental design was a completely randomized design in a 3 × 2 × 2 factorial scheme, which consisted of three genotypes, two diets, and two periods, and five replications each. BGHI presented values of 81 in the shade and 90 in the sun and a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed for the studied variables in relation to the periods, with higher values in the afternoon. The average ST was 35.48 °C in the morning and 38.11 °C in the afternoon. Morada Nova presented the lowest RT and RR (P < 0.05) among the genetic groups, with a higher tolerance to heat. The 30% substitution of tifton hay by hairy woodrose hay did not negatively affect the thermoregulatory capacity of sheep.

40,2019,Effect of the inclusion of lysine and methionine on the nutritional performance and ingestive behavior of lambs,"Lysine and methionine are the most limiting amino acids for ruminants; their inclusion in the free form is not effective, since they are quickly degraded by ruminal microorganisms, making the fulfillment of the requirements of metabolizable protein difficult. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of including different levels of lysine and methionine, protected from ruminal degradation, in the diet of lambs; more specifically, their effects on intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and ingestive behavior. The experiment was conducted at the Experimental Farm Capim Branco, Federal University of Uberlândia, from September to October 2016. Five 1/2Dorper x 1/2Santa Inês lambs, at approximately eight months of age and an average weight of 50 kg, were distributed in a 5x5 Latin square design, with five treatments and five replicates. The treatments consisted of different levels (0 g, 8 g, 16 g, 24 g and 32 g) of lysine and methionine added to the diet, protected from ruminal degradation (MicroPEARLS LM ®). The feed was composed of corn silage and concentrate (30V: 70C), offered twice daily at 08h00 and 16h00. The experiment lasted 75 days and was divided into five phases. Each phase lasted 15 days, with 10 days for adaptation of the animals and five days of data collection. The animals were kept in individual metabolic cages, with a feeder, drinker and salt shaker. A digestibility assay was performed to determine the consumption and apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber and acid (NDF/NDA). Urine volume and density, stool weight and fecal score, nitrogen balance and ingestive behavior were recorded. In relation to metabolic and body weight, DM intake (kg day-1) presented a positive linear response with the inclusion of amino acids, as well as the CP intake, NDF intake, ingested nitrogen and nitrogen balance, which were positive in all treatments. There was no difference (P < 0.05) in the digestibility coefficients of DM, CP and NDF. Water consumption was high in all treatments, but did not differ by treatment (P > 0.05). Ingestive behavior was not influenced (P > 0.05). The inclusion of up to 32 g of protected lysine and methionine increases DM and nutrient intake, without negatively affecting digestibility. The high CP intake induced an increase in the urinary nitrogen excretion, and consequently, an increase in the energy expenditure.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33777/25278,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effects of neutral detergent fiber concentration of sugarcane-based diets on the performance of Holstein heifers,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of increasing the neutral detergent fibers (NDF) concentration of sugarcane-based diets on the growth and development of Holstein heifers. Twenty-seven Holstein heifers with a mean body weight of 265.5 ± 36.4 kg were housed in a sand bedded tie stall and fed individually. The experimental diet consisted of fresh sugarcane and concentrate. Three concentrations of sugarcane NDF were compared: 33% (SC33), 38% (SC38), and 42% (SC42). Crude protein content of experimental diets was 16%. The following parameters were evaluated: dry matter intake, weight gain and morphometric measures, digestibility, feeding behavior, and ruminal pH. The experimental design was a randomized block and all analyses were performed using the MIXED procedure in SAS. Intake of DM decreased as NDF concentration increased (p=0.07), but weight gain and growth were not significantly affected (p=0.74). As dietary NDF increased, chewing activity per unit DM intake increased (p=0.001), but rumen pH was not significantly affected (p=0.91). Diets formulated with 330?420 g of sugarcane NDF/kg of dry matter were sufficient to support the growth of Holstein heifers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33731/25277,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Growth curves and genetic parameters in Nelore animals estimated by random regression models,"The objective of this work was to estimate growth curves and genetic parameters from birth to 650 days of age of Nelore cattle raised in pasture in two production regions of the Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (233,835 weight records from 47,459 cattle were analyzed). Genetic parameters were determined by random regression using Legendre orthogonal polynomials of cubic order, and age at weighing was considered in the model as a fixed effect to model the average growth trajectory. In the models, the effects of the contemporary group were considered as fixed and, as covariates, the animal age at weighing and the cow age at calving were nested in the animal age class (linear and quadratic effects), forming eight age classes. All models included the direct genetic additive, maternal genetic, and animal permanent environment as random effects, and the most appropriate model to describe the studied effects was defined according to the AIC and BIC criteria. Heritability estimates for birth weight varied between the two production regions, Campo Grande-Dourados (R1) and Alto Taquari-Bolsão (R2) and R1 (0.36 ± 0.02) and R2 (0.28 ± 0.03), and there were variations in the estimates at advanced ages. In both regions, the highest heritability values at 650 days of age were 0.47 ± 0.03 and 0.65 ± 0.02 for R1 and R2, respectively, with high heritability reflecting the high values of additive genetic variance. The random regression methodology was efficient in estimating growth curves and genetic parameters. Growth curves were different when they were estimated separately by sex, birth season, and production region. Genetic parameters estimated separately by region indicate differences in additive genetic variance, maternal additive, and animal permanent environment for weights up to 650 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33658/25276,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Effect of including different levels of crude glycerin in feed on plasma triglyceride concentrations in pigs, and the composition and qualitative attributes of pork","This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of including two types of crude glycerin (CG) in feed on plasma parameters, quantitative and qualitative carcass characteristics, and the fatty acid profile of the Longissimus dorsi pig muscle. Sixty-three commercial line pigs were used, with an average weight of 30.53 ± 1.59 to 59.55 ± 4.27 kg in the growing phase and 60.35 ± 2.25 to 89.91 ± 5.23 kg in the finishing phase. The pigs’ diet included two sources of CG (vegetable and mixed) at four inclusion levels (3%, 6%, 9% and 12%). One CG was derived from soybean oil (VCG) and the other from 80% animal fat + 20% soybean oil (MCG). The control diet contained 0% glycerin. Blood samples were collected at the beginning, middle and final phases of the trial. In addition, at the end of the finishing phase, the animals were fasted for 12 h and then sacrificed to measure the quantitative and qualitative carcass characteristics and the fatty acid profile of the Longissimus dorsi. The results indicate that in both phases there was a quadratic effect on plasma triglycerides. There was no effect on carcass parameters. A quadratic behaviour for pH24 h was obtained, with the lowest value attained at 1.05% CG inclusion. There was an interaction between the type of glycerin and the inclusion level in the diets for polyunsaturated fatty acids. VCG and MCG can be used at up to 12% inclusion because they cause no negative effects on carcass characteristics and pig meat quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33595/25275,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Nutritional evaluation of corn grown using different organic fertilizers for slow-growing broilers,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition, energy values and nutrient metabolizability coefficients of corn grown using different organic fertilizers and its use for feeding slow-growing broilers. Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, two hundred 21-day-old broilers were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and four replicates of 10 birds per experimental unit. The treatments were a control diet and four test diets (corn fertilized with crotalaria, corn fertilized with millet, corn fertilized with humus, and corn without fertilization), including corn at 30% in the control diet. The apparent metabolizable energy, apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen balance, and apparent metabolizability coefficients of dry matter, crude protein and gross energy were determined. In the performance trial, two hundred and fifty 1-day-old chicks were distributed in a completely randomized design into five treatments (T1 – control diet with commercial corn, T2 – corn without fertilization, T3 – corn fertilized with humus, T4 – corn fertilized with millet and T5 – corn fertilized with crotalaria) and five replicates of 10 birds per experimental unit. Weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion and final weight at 20 days were evaluated. The AME and AMEn values of corn fertilized with crotalaria, millet, humus and corn without fertilization were 3246 and 3239 kcal kg?1; 2965 and 2954 kcal kg?1; 2909 and 2877 kcal kg?1; and 3265 and 3201 kcal kg?1, respectively. The apparent metabolizable coefficients of DM, CP and GE were: 89.75%, 66.88% and 88.5% for corn fertilized with crotalaria; 84.38%, 58.73% and 81.4% for corn fertilized with millet; 80.38%, 53.45% and 78.95% for corn fertilized with humus; and 89.48%, 68.95% and 87.85% for corn without fertilization, respectively. Feeding broilers with corn cultivated with different fertilizers affected (P < 0.05) weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion and final weight. The treatments using corn fertilized with crotalaria, millet, humus and commercial corn did not differ, with better results in relation to corn crop cultivated without fertilization. The use of crotalaria and millet as a green manure, and humus derived from dairy manure are alternatives that can be used on corn crop as they resulted in grains with adequate nutritional composition, energy values and metabolizable coefficients for slow-growing broilers from 1 to 20 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33421/25273,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Performance of two varieties of Nile tilapia farming in hapas and excavated ponds in Brazil,"The great commercial potential of Nile tilapia is due to features such as its high production performance, its adaptability to different farming systems, and the development of genetic varieties with superior performance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of two varieties, GIFT (Genetic Improvement of Farmed Tilapia) and Supreme, grown in hapas in concrete tanks and grown in excavated ponds. Were used 200 and 1234 fingerlings of both varieties, GIFT and Supreme (average initial weight of 0.83 g), for farming in hapas and ponds, respectively. Biometric measurements were taken at four farming stages (fingerling, juvenile, growth, and fattening). Were measured weight (g), total length (cm), standard length (cm), trunk length (cm), head length (cm), head height (cm), body height (cm), weight gain (g) and head/edible-part ratio. For all parameters and in all stages, superior results were observed for tilapia reared in excavated ponds. When the varieties were compared, GIFT had the best performance for most parameters in the fingerling stage, and for weight, total length, and body height in the juvenile stage. Both varieties grew better in excavated ponds. Moreover, GIFT showed higher growth than Supreme during all stages when grown in excavated ponds. Supreme showed higher growth than GIFT in hapas only in the growth stage. Thus, it is concluded that the rearing in excavated ponds provided better results, with superiority of the GIFT variety, which was more able to take advantage of the favorable conditions of this system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33386/25326,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,In vitro fermentation of the rations containing Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) using two types of inoculum,"The effect of inclusion of Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) in standardized diets of sheep on in vitro digestibility and parameters fermentation was examined using two different inoculums (ruminal liquid and sheep feces). To determine the nutrients’ in vitro digestibility coefficient (IVDC), two sheep were used as inoculum donors. The experimental design was factorial (4 × 2), with four diets containing different proportions of Noni and two types of inoculum. The different dietary proportions of Noni (0%, 8%, 16%, and 24%) did not affect the IVDC of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) for both inoculums. The IVDC of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) differed significantly between the inoculums. After in vitro incubation for 24 h, the pH value of the fermented material differed between the different diets and between the inoculums. Moreover, the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen was affected by the proportion of Noni and differed between the inoculums after incubation for 24 h. The inclusion of up to 24% of Noni in standardized rations for ruminants did not affect the IVDC of DM, OM, CP, and NDF. The use of feces as inoculum for in vitro fermentation produced lower IVDC values than those by ruminal liquid. The diet containing 8% of Noni and fermented with ruminal liquid produced higher pH values after 24 h of incubation. Taken together, the different dietary Noni proportions and the different inoculums can alter the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen of sheep diets after 24 h in vitro fermentation; however, they seem not to affect the IVDC of the nutrients.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33331/25267,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,In vivo biometry and carcass characteristics of lambs in different finishing systems,"The aim of this study was to assess the influence of different finishing systems on the in vivo measurements, quantitative and qualitative carcass characteristics, commercial cut ratio, and shoulder tissue composition of lambs. Thirty-two male lambs were distributed in four finishing systems with eight replications each, as follows: suckling lambs on pasture; suckling lambs in confinement, with access to creep-feeding containing corn bran and soybean meal; weaned lambs fed roughage, characterized by ad libitum supply of alfalfa hay; and weaned lambs fed concentrate, composed of oat grain and soybean meal. The lambs were slaughtered as they reached the pre-set live weight at slaughtering of 30 kg. Most of the in vivo biometry variables were not significant (P > 0.05) when comparing the finishing systems, except for hindlimb height and thoracic perimeter. Regarding the quantitative carcass characteristics, all variables differed (P < 0.05) between systems, except for carcass length, leg width, and subcutaneous fat thickness. For the qualitative carcass characteristics, only the fatness and carcass conformation presented significant differences (P < 0.05). Most in vivo measurements and the proportion of carcass cuts were not influenced by finishing systems. Weaned lambs fed an exclusive concentrate diet presented leaner carcasses with an inferior conformation when compared to the other finishing systems. Suckling lambs in confinement presented shoulders with a higher fat deposition when compared to those weaned. Suckling lambs both on pasture and in confinement presented a superiority in the quantitative carcass characteristics when compared to weaned lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33357/25325,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Management of natural pasture increases native and exotic herbaceous biomass and biodiversity in the Caatinga of Brazil,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of savanna thinning and enrichment with grasses to maintain local biodiversity and intensify biomass production in an area of Caatinga. The study was carried out in a Caatinga area thinned into savanna and an unmanipulated area during the rainy and rainy-dry transition seasons of 2016. The herbaceous biomass production, diversity, and equability of the thinned and unmanipulated areas were evaluated by calculating values of the Shannon-Weaver (H?) and Pielou (J?) indices. The establishment of massai and buffel grasses in the savanna-thinned area was also evaluated. The area thinned into savanna produced more native herbaceous forage biomass in both the rainy (1,940.55 kg ha-1) and rainy-dry transition seasons (1,918.55 kg ha-1) than that in the unmanipulated area in the same periods (78.42 and 37.40 kg ha-1, respectively), without compromising biodiversity, as the Shannon-Weaver and Pielou indices for the savanna-thinned area (H? = 1.48 and J? = 0.62, respectively) and for the unmanipulated area (H? = 1.29 and J? = 0.72) were comparable. The frequency of species with a known forage value in the area thinned into savanna was still able to increase by 141% in the rainy season and 1,700% in the rainy-dry transition season. Massai grass became better-established in the savanna-thinned area that buffel grass, where it produced up to 3 t of dry matter ha-1. The thinning and enrichment treatments promoted an increase in the biodiversity of the area, and moreover contributed to increases in forage biomass in the Caatinga.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33362/25270,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Heifers were grouped into three weight classes at the age of 24 months: 50-59.9% (55%), 60-69.9% (65%), and 70-80% (75%). The pregnancy rate in the first reproductive year in heifers from weight classes 55%, 65%, and 75% was 38.0%, 56.4%, and 69.0%, respectively. The pregnancy rate in the second reproductive year was not affected by weight at first mating (p > 0.05) and corresponded to 41.6%; 42.1%, and 50.4% in the three weight classes, respectively. The weight class of heifers before mating at the age of 24 months affected reproductive performance at first mating but did not increase the pregnancy rate in the second reproductive year.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33328/25266,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Physicochemical characteristics and gene expression of meat from does fed with dried carnauba wax palm fruit,"This trial was carried out with the objective to evaluate the effect of feeding dried carnauba wax palm fruit on the quality of goat meat. Initially, the animals were divided into two groups: a control group, fed with ground corn-based concentrate, and a treatment group, fed with dried carnauba wax palm fruit included in the concentrate. After 28 days of feeding, the animals were slaughtered, and different muscles (Longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus) were evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, fatty acid profile, and expression of some genes related to meat quality. The diet with carnauba wax palm fruit does not interfere in the chemical composition of the meat in terms of moisture content, protein, fat, pH, and meat color. On the other hand, palmitic (C16:0) and linoleic (C18:2) fatty acids presented differences between muscles in the group fed carnauba wax palm fruit. The treatment with carnauba wax palm fruit reduces the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and cholesterol metabolism, suggesting the production of a tender meat with lower cholesterol content. The inclusion of carnauba wax palm fruit in the diet of does maintained the physicochemical characteristics of the loin and leg, and it reduced the expression of the analyzed genes, suggesting improvement in meat quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33052/25264,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Age polynomial functions of different orders were evaluated using a random-effect modeling associated with a genetic study of cattle growth curves. For this purpose, weight records (15,148) were performed in Polled Nellore bovines (3,115), aged between 1 and 660 days, reared in northern Brazil and born between 1995 and 2010. The fixed effects of analytical models comprised age-matched groups, heifer calving age (linear and quadratic), and fourth-order Legendre age polynomial (cubic), depicting the mean growth curve. Besides, different order functions were considered for random effects, so that (co) variance associated with genetic effects (direct and maternal) and permanent environmental effects (animal and maternal) could be modeled. Residual variance was fitted by six heterogeneous classes throughout the analyzed period. According to AIC and BIC criteria, the model 6333 allowed the fitting of changes in variance and covariance over time (genetic and environmental). Thus, this model can be used to describe age-related changes in Polled Nellore cattle reared in northern Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32783/25263,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Isolation and identification of Yersinia enterocolitica in bovine milk samples of bulk tanks from dairy farms in São Paulo, Brazil","Milk and its derivatives are good substrates for the proliferation of pathogenic and quality-deteriorating microorganisms, demanding rigorous care with milking, processing, and storage. Among the various bacteria that can grow in raw refrigerated milk, Yersinia enterocolitica, is an invasive enteropathogen of humans. This bacterium can cause a number of intestinal and extraintestinal clinical symptoms, ranging from mild gastroenteritis to mesenteric lymphadenitis, similar to appendicitis. To evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica in raw milk from bulk milk tanks located in the State of São Paulo, 102 bovine milk samples (one per dairy farm) were evaluated by microbiological analyses, followed by biochemical tests PCR and genetic sequencing. Microbiological testing did not isolate Y. enterocolitica. However, PCR analysis revealed six samples that were positive for Y. enterocolitica (5.9%), confirmed by genetic sequencing. Only the inv gene was detected, which is present in virulent and avirulent Y. enterocolitica strains. There was great difficulty in microbiological isolation due to the difficulty of competitiveness of Y. enterocolitica in a very rich microbiota of raw milk. Although virulence genes known to be present in potentially pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica have not been identified, the presence of this pathogen in milk from expansion tanks, identified through PCR and confirmed by genetic sequencing, suggests that Y. enterocolitica may be a risk to public health, especially if milk and its derivatives are consumed without heat treatment.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33875/25259,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Ruminal metabolic parameters and milk fatty acid profile of cows grazing Marandu grass supplemented with roasted soybeans,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the ruminal metabolic parameters and milk fatty acid composition of cows managed under continuous grazing on Marandu grass. Four rumen-cannulated Holstein x Gyr cows with an average milk yield of 21±2 kg day-1 and 79±16 days in milk were used in a 4 x 4 Latin Square design. Each cow received 6 kg day-1 of a concentrate formulated with 0 (control), 1.3, 2.6 or 3.9 kg of roasted soybeans (as-fed basis), which were the experimental treatments. The inclusion of roasted soybeans promoted a linear reduction in the acetate concentration, with no effect on the pH and ruminal ammonia N concentration. There was no effect of the treatments on the ruminal degradability of the dry matter and neutral detergent fiber of Marandu grass or on the kinetic parameters of the fluids in the rumen. There were linear increases in the contents of fat and total solids in the milk and a linear decrease in the milk lactose content, but there was no effect of the treatments on the yield of these components or on milk yield. There were linear increases in milk fat stearic, elaidic, oleic, linoleic and ?-linolenic acids contents, but there was no effect of the treatments on the milk fat contents of vaccenic and rumenic acids. Notably, supplementing Marandu grass with a concentrate containing up to 3.9 kg of roasted soybeans improved the nutritional quality of the milk fat due to increases in the milk fat contents of oleic and ?-linolenic acids, which are considered beneficial to human health, and reductions in the levels of lauric, myristic and palmitic, which are considered hypercholesterolemic fatty acids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31124/25261,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Comparison of two methods for the quantification of gastrointestinal nematode infective larvae from pasture,"The economic losses caused by gastrointestinal nematodes are one of the biggest obstacles in the small ruminants production. Understanding the population dynamics of the infective larvae (L3) in the pasture is the key point to develop control programs, and reliable results depend on the used methodology to quantify L3 numbers. The use of the sampling directly from the pasture appears as a viable option, since it is not required the use of animals with an esophageal fistula or tracer animals, decreasing the costs involved in the study. Therefore, the present project, which had as objective evaluate the efficiency of two collection methods for quantification of L3 in the pasture, utilized 64 lambs (n = 16) allocated to four integrated crop-livestock systems (treatments) with 12 paddocks each. Pasture samples were collected every nine days. The W method consists in traversing the area in the form of a W and again an inverted W, forage samples being collected every 10 steps, and the Square method, in tossing a 0.16 m2 square to four random points within the area, the forage within the square being collected after each toss. After the forage samples had been processed, the L3 were recovered and identified. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) was determined. The W-transect and Random-plot methods did not differ (p ? 0.05) with respect to the number of L3 recovered from the pasture, and a positive correlation was found between them, suggesting agreement with one another, being that when the number of L3 recovered by the W-transect method increases, the same occurs in the Random-plot technique. The Random-plot method, which is already used to collect samples of forage for chemical analyses, can also be employed to estimate the pasture contamination by L3. The W-transect and Random-plot methods showed to be important in the epidemiological study of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep. Therefore, the use of both on the same occasions and with different purposes, with one complementing the information that is not provided by the other, may be more effective in the investigation of environmental contamination by L3 of gastrointestinal nematodes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33676/25258,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Effect of supplementation with Escherichia coli phytase for broilers on performance, nutrient digestibility, minerals in the tibia and diet cost","Although phytase has been researched, new enzymes have been produced, leading to different animal responses. In this scenario, the present study proposes to evaluate the inclusion of a bacterial phytase produced by Escherichia coli in broiler diets based on corn and soybean meal, with or without nutrient reductions, on the performance, nutrient digestibility, phosphorus bioavailability, and bone minerals of those animals and on the economic viability of this practice. A total of 896 male broiler chickens were distributed into 32 experimental units, each housing 28 broilers. The experiment was set up as a completely randomized design with four treatments (Positive Control (PC)- diet meeting the nutritional requirements of the broiler chickens; Negative Control (NC) with reductions of 100kcal/kg of ME, 0.14% avP and 0.11% tCa; NC + phytase (500 FTU/kg); PC + phytase (500FTU/kg)) and 8 replicates. Phytase increased (p < 0.05) feed intake and body weight gain and improved feed conversion ratio in starter (1 to 21 days) and total (1 to 42 days) phases, respectively, compared with Negative Control diet without supplementation. The Negative Control + phytase diet also led to a feed intake similar to Positive Control in the starter and total phases. The inclusion of phytase without nutrient reductions improved (p < 0.05) feed conversion ratio in the starter phase, compared to Positive Control diet. There was an increase (p < 0.05) in the digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and phosphorus and in apparent digestible energy in the Negative Control + phytase diet compared to the Negative Control diet. Phytase supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the digestibility of crude protein, calcium and phosphorus, and apparent digestible energy compared to Positive Control diet. Ash, phosphorus, and calcium contents were higher in the Negative Control + phytase diet compared with those observed in the Negative Control diet without enzyme (p < 0.05). The Positive Control + phytase diet provided higher ash contents (p < 0.05), but calcium and phosphorus deposition was similar to those obtained with Positive Control diet. Phytase inclusion allows for a reduction in the diet cost per ton of produced feed. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with bacterial phytase produced from Escherichia coli for broiler chickens is recommended, as it provided increases in production performance, nutrient digestibility, and energy metabolizability and a reduction in the diet cost.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32706/25262,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis in equines in the northwest region of Paraná,"Leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis are diseases that may affect man and domestic and wild animals. They also have wide geographical distributions and thus cause large public health issues. The objective of the current study was to conduct leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis seroepidemiology in horses used for animal traction in small rural propertiesof the municipality of Umuarama, in northwest region of the state of Paraná, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 312 horses from 87 small farms. Microscopic agglutination tests (MAT) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis were performed on sera to detect leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis, respectively. These were performed in conjunction with an epidemiological questionnaire. The MAT results included 180 (57.69%) samples that were considered reactive with titers between 100 and 12800 for one or more serovars. Thirty-three (10.57%) samples subjected to IIF were considered reactive, with titers ranging between 64 and 1024. From the analyzed variables, contact with wild animals (p= 0.012) and animal exchange between properties (p = 0.004) were associated with toxoplasma infection. The study revealed that horses in the northwestern region of Paraná were exposed to Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii, with an insignificant implication of the animals’ clinical condition; however, since it is possible for animals to transmit infection to other animals as well as humans via the intermittent shedding of leptospires through urine into the environment, it may be considered a problem of one health. As for the presence of T. gondii antibodies, these horses played the role of sentinel of the infection. Environmental sanitation measures, serological studies of herds, control of rodents and felids on properties, and the dissemination of information about these diseases are relevant for disease control at the study site.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33616/25369,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Herbage accumulation dynamics in digit grass subjected to defoliation frequencies,"This study was undertaken to examine the herbage accumulation dynamics and structural characteristics of digit grass subjected to different defoliation frequencies in the period of January 2015 to February 2016. Four defoliation frequencies [very high (25 cm), high (35 cm), medium (45 cm), and low (55 cm)] were evaluated in two periods of the year [greater insolation (September to March) and lesser insolation (April to August)]. The experiment was set up as a randomized-block design with four replicates. Overall, the decreasing defoliation frequencies increased the cutting interval; leaf area index; total-herbage, stem, and dead-herbage accumulation rates; and percentages of stems and dead herbage. This reduction in defoliation frequency also resulted in a lower leaf accumulation rate and percentage of leaves. In overall terms, digit grass showed higher total-herbage, leaf, and stem accumulation rates; percentages of stems and dead herbage; stem volume density; and tiller density in the period of greater insolation. In the period of lesser insolation, however, digit grass exhibited a lower dead-herbage accumulation rate and a lower percentage of dead herbage. Less frequent defoliations increase the herbage accumulation rates of digit grass, but result in a less desirable morphological composition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29721/25260,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Digital radiography and ultrasonography in evaluation of the canine prostate,"This study aimed to evaluate the canine prostate using ultrasonography and digital radiography. The study involved 21 intact dogs of mixed breed, with a mean weight of 8.7 ± 3.09 kg and without previous hormonal treatment. The dogs were divided into three groups according to the age: GI (0-3 years); GII (3-7 years); GIII (7+ years). Prostates from each animal were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by means of digital rectal examination, ultrasonography and digital radiography. A total of 882 measurements were obtained and 84 qualitative analyses. The results demonstrated association and high agreement between digital rectal examination and radiography for prostatomegaly diagnosis (p = 0.0030; K = 0.829268). Ultrasonography and digital rectal examination did not present an association and had low agreement for diagnosis of alterations in prostatic parenchyma (p = 1; K = 0.049383). Also, there was a difference between ultrasonographic and radiographic measurements (height: p = 0.0002; length: p < 0.0001; width: p < 0.0001). However, the measurements from distinct radiographic projections showed no difference between each other (width: p = 0.3543; length: p = 0.3079 and p = 0.9725; height: p = 0.3208). Prostatic volume based on ultrasonographic measurements showed a positive correlation being proportional to the age of the dog (p = 0.0383). It was concluded that both methods, ultrasonography and radiography, are relevant diagnostic tools in evaluating the canine prostate, beyond just complementing each other. There are limitations associated with both imaging methods, which should be taken into consideration when planning a specific investigation of the canine prostate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32668/25255,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Outbreak of salt poisoning in goats in the state of Pará, Brazil","The present study reports two outbreaks of salt poisoning in goats on a property in the state of Pará, Brazil. The outbreaks occurred in July and August 2011 when young and adult goats received a mineral mixture after approximately three days of restriction from the supplement. The animals were kept in barns with a high stocking density and had an inadequate supply of water. In the second outbreak, the goats were supplemented too with brewery residue added to 3.3% of the mixture mineral. From a flock of 191 goats, 12 animals (nine crossbreeds, two Anglo-Nubians and one Boer) showed nervous symptomatology, and the morbidity rate was 6.28%. The most frequent clinical signs were head lowering, head tilt, muscle weakness, mydriasis and ataxia. Three goats died, four recovered spontaneously from the first outbreak, and five recovered from the second outbreak over three days after treatment with dexamethasone, thiamine and gradual water supply. The lethality rate was 25%. In two animals, necropsy was performed, and no macro- or microscopic alterations in the nervous system or other organs were observed. These negative pathological findings indicate that the neurological clinical signs were initiated by functional disturbances in the central nervous system. In the brain, a high sodium concentration (3703 and 3675 ppm), compared with the reference values for cattle was detected. Normonatremia was observed in the sick goats, and hypernatremia was observed in the goats from the same lot of affected animals based on blood serum samples obtained before the first outbreak. These results pointed out that the goats were consuming high sodium concentrations. Normal values for the sick animals were assigned after rapid osmotic control via adequate water intake. We conclude that the salt poisoning on the goats occurred due to a high intake of the mineral mixture caused by management errors and associated with water restrictions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33091/25256,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Histopathological alterations in the reproductive tract of male dogs with Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis,"Dogs are considered the main domestic host of Leishmania infantum. The transmission between vertebrate hosts normally occurs during blood feeding of Lutzomyia sp., a genus of phlebotomine sand flies. However, other forms of transmission without a vector have been reported. Presence of amastigotes of Leishmania sp. in different organs can cause several pathologies depending on the immune status of the host and the parasite load. The aim of this study was to evaluate histopathological changes in the reproductive tract of male dogs. Samples of testes, epididymis, and prostate gland were collected from 70 animals that were grouped according to serology test results for visceral leishmaniasis and clinical symptoms. Three experimental groups were formed based on serological results and clinical presentation: asymptomatic, symptomatic and control. Prostatic changes were seen regardless of the serological results; however, the changes were more severe in symptomatic animals. In the testes and epididymis, lesions such as interstitial infiltrate, degeneration, and fibrosis were seen more frequently and were more severe in positive animals when compared to the control group. These results demonstrate that dogs infected with Leishmania sp. can develop nonspecific changes in the reproductive tract, which are more severe in symptomatic animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29763/25254,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Consumer preference and the technological, cooking and nutritional quality of carioca beans","Carioca beans will achieve better consumer acceptability if they exhibit high grain quality. The objectives of this work were to identify the visual quality traits that determine consumer choice of carioca beans; to evaluate whether the commercial brands of carioca beans present differences in their technological, cooking and nutritional quality traits; and to select the best commercial brand of carioca beans according to these traits using a selection index. For this purpose, six different commercial brands of carioca beans were evaluated with respect to consumer preference and their grain physicochemical traits. The visual quality traits, colour and grain size, defined the consumer choice of carioca beans. The commercial brands of carioca beans presented differences regarding their technological, cooking and nutritional quality traits. Brand 4 had lighter colour grains (L* = 53.33), a slightly red shade (a* = 6.20), medium-sized beans (27.52 g), an elliptical shape, a semi-full flatness, and a fast cooking time (15 min and 25 s). The brand 4 showed high concentrations of protein, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, zinc and copper, and this sample was the preference of 51.92% of the survey participants. The best commercial brand of carioca beans selected by the selection index was brand 4 for its technological, cooking and nutritional quality traits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33874/25253,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Economic of the irrigated production of forage millet,"Irrigation is an agricultural technique that increases crop yield and reduces periods of forage shortage. However, this technique increases production costs, and the process is economically viable only when costs are lower than the financial return. Determining the technical and financial viability of irrigation is essential to assess the feasibility of forage production systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the technical and financial viability of irrigated producing of forage millet in different growing seasons in two microregions of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The water requirements of the growing seasons of 2012 to 2017 in the microregions of Santiago and Santa Maria varied and affected the cost of irrigation. The irrigated production of forage millet increased the total average cost by 13.42% and increased the financial return by 43.03% and 22.49% in Santiago and Santa Maria, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32701/25251,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Microbiological quality of colonial cheese sold in Porto Alegre-RS,"Colonial cheese is a traditional dairy product in southern Brazil and is commonly purchased by the citizens of Porto Alegre. However, there is still a lack of technical regulation of colonial cheese, and there is little information about the microbiological quality of this product at the retail level. Thus, the objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate compliance with the legal microbiological standards of colonial cheese sampled from street fairs and the central market of the city of Porto Alegre; (ii) statistically test the hypothesis of an association between noncompliance with the standards and local purchasing (street fairs or central market); (iii) estimate the number of Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in the positive samples; and (iv) characterize the L. monocytogenes strains by serotyping and macrorestriction (PFGE). For this purpose, 205 cheese samples belonging to 17 different brands were analyzed. The microbiological analyses were conducted according to ISO standardized protocols for the detection of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. or by enumeration of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and coliforms at 45°C. Among the samples, 47.31% did not comply with at least one of the microbiological standards established by the Brazilian legislation and were thus unsuitable for human consumption. Regarding the coliforms at 45ºC and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, 10.73% and 40.48% of the samples presented higher counts than the legal parameter, respectively. There was no association between the frequency of samples with coagulase-positive Staphylococcus counts above the legal parameter and local of purchasing; however, the commercial brand influenced the frequency of unsuitable samples. This may indicate failures of hygiene during cheese production. Salmonella spp. were not detected. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from 2.9% of the samples. The estimated average populations of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes were low in the positive cheese samples at -3.3 log CFU g?1 and -2.26 log CFU g?¹, respectively. The strains of L. monocytogenes belonged to serovars 1/2a, 1/2b and 1/2c and could be grouped into five pulsotypes with no evident epidemiological relation among them. The results demonstrate the need to improve the hygiene procedures during colonial cheese production and to strengthen monitoring at the dairy plants and retail levels.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33488/25324,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Diversity of the edaphic macrofauna in areas managed under no-tillage for different periods,"Agriculture can considerably change the composition and richness of the edaphic macrofauna, affecting the ecological and biological functions exerted by the fauna. This study was carried out in commercial production systems in the municipality of Guaíra, state of Paraná, Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of no-tillage systems (NTS) and seasonality on the diversity, richness, and composition of the edaphic macrofauna. Three areas managed under NTS for different periods 7 years (NTS-7), 14 years (NTS-14), and 23 years (NTS-23) under crop succession with soybean (summer) (aNTS7) and maize/wheat (winter) (NTS14 and NTS23) were evaluated, in addition to a native Atlantic Forest segment, which was used as a reference. Faunal samples were collected in the dry season (September 2013) and rainy season (February 2014). The edaphic macrofauna was evaluated using the method proposed by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Program. Parametric statistics were applied, and the results were compared using Tukey’s test at a level of significance of 5%. Species density and total richness were usually higher in the NTS14 and NTS23 in the dry season. However, higher indexes of equability were not detected because of the dominance of groups Formicidae and Isoptera. The areas with the highest equability were the reference area in the dry season and NTS23 in the rainy season, corresponding to 0.87 and 0.61, respectively. These results indicate the higher faunal diversity in these areas, which reflects the greater stability of the ecosystem.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32106/25249,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Physiological potential of popcorn seeds submitted to water stress after treated with bioregulator,"Seed performance is one of the key points for high productivity in crop development. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological potential of popcorn cultivar seeds (IAC 125 and BRS-Ângela) treated with Stimulate® bioregulator under water stress. Popcorn seeds were submitted to different osmotic potential levels 0; -0.1; -0.3; -0.6 and -0.9 MPa and induced by mannitol, after being treated with bioregulator at the dose of 1.5 L 100 kg-1 of seeds. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, in a 5 × 2 × 2 factorial design (osmotic potential levels x cultivars x absence and presence of bioregulator). The variables evaluated were: first count and final count of germination standard, shoot length, primary root length, and dry biomass of seedlings. Treating popcorn seeds with bioregulator is inefficient in improving the physiological potential under normal conditions and little water restriction, but under conditions in which water may be limited, the use of bioregulator positively influences germination, growth, and initial performance of seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31617/25322,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Nitrogen as a mitigator of salt stress in yellow passion fruit seedlingss,"The poor chemical quality of water, especially in arid and semiarid regions, almost always precludes the practice of irrigated agriculture, thus demanding the adoption of techniques that mitigate the deleterious effects of excess salt on soil and plants. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of nitrogen fertilization in mitigating the negative effects of excess salt in irrigation water on the growth of yellow passion fruit seedlings grown in a greenhouse in plastic tubes containing 0.65 dm3 of substrate. The treatments were organized in randomized blocks, in accordance with a 5 × 3 factorial scheme – five electrical conductivities of irrigation water (0.3, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 dS m?1) combined with three levels of nitrogen fertilizer (no nitrogen fertilization and 150 mg dm?3 of N derived from either ammonium sulfate or urea). Evaluations were performed 80 days after sowing and consisted of measuring the seedling height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf concentration of chlorophyll a and b and total chlorophyll, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, and Dickson quality index. An increase in the electrical conductivity of irrigation water hindered the production of yellow passion fruit seedlings. Nitrogen fertilization, with urea or ammonium sulfate, mitigated the effects of irrigation water salinity and favored the growth and quality of yellow passion fruit seedlings. Yellow passion fruit seedlings with a minimum quality standard (DQI) can be produced with irrigation water with salinity of 1.8 dS m?1, which means they can be considered as moderately sensitive. The higher quality provided by nitrogen to the yellow passion fruit seedlings made them more tolerant to salinity, allowing the use of water with salinity of 2.1 and 2.5 dS m?1 under fertilization with ammonium sulfate and urea, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32663/25250,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) alters the nutrients in the hemolymph, fat body, and cytochemistry of Diatraea flavipennella Box (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) hemocytes","Nutritional and physiological interactions depend on the evolutionary history of the host-parasitoid interaction considering that the host’s regulation by the parasitoid is species-specific. Cotesia flavipes Cameron was introduced in Brazil in the 70’s to be used in the control of Diatraea sugarcane borer complex; however, Diatraea flavipennella Box is restricted to Brazil. Thus, this study investigated the possible nutritional changes in the hemolymph and fat body, and cytochemistry of D. flavipennella hemocytes parasitized by Cotesia flavipes. The levels of nutrients were quantified using colorimetric tests in the hemolymph and fat body. Levels of acidic polysaccharides, mucin, and lipids were investigated only in hemocytes using cytochemical techniques. In addition, histological sections of parasitized and non-parasitized caterpillars were prepared to observe volume changes and the presence of glycogen in the fat body. The results showed a reduction in protein and lipid concentration in the hemolymph of parasitized caterpillars. The parasitism reduced the levels of total carbohydrate, glycogen, and protein in the fat body and almost completely consumed the perivisceral fat body. It changed the cytochemistry of hemocytes and reduced acidic glycans in prohemocytes and oenocytoids, mucin in plasmatocytes and granulocytes, and lipids in adipohemocytes, granulocytes, and prohemocytes. We concluded that the presence of the parasitoid leads to different changes in D. flavipennella hemolymph and fat body and alters the cytochemistry of hemocytes causing a significant reduction in the reserve tissue. The results from this study contribute to consolidating the use of C. flavipes in biological control programs targeting D. flavipennella in sugarcane crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30632/25244,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Growth, nutrient concentration, nutrient accumulation and visual symptoms of nutrient deficiencies in cherry tomato plants","Tomato is one of the most popular vegetables, with high nutrient demand. The nutrient concentration can vary depending on the development phase, cultivation system, temperature, soil conditions, luminosity, relative humidity and management practices. The aim of this work was to characterize cherry tomato visual symptoms of deficiency, as well as the effect of nutritional restriction on the development and nutrient concentration of plants cultivated in nutrient solution. Plants of the cherry tomato, cultivar Sindy, were grown in green house. We have used eleven treatments, one control with complete nutrient solution and the other ten omitting respectively the nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, zinc and iron. The experiment was performed in randomized design with three repetitions. After 60 days, the plants were removed from the solutions and their main symptoms were photographed and described. The traits evaluated were: total dry matter yield, dry matter of leaves, dry matter of stems and dry matter of roots; number of leaves, number of inflorescences; number of fruits and root volume. The concentration and accumulation of nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, zinc and iron in leaves, stems and roots were evaluated. Nutrient concentration and accumulation were influenced by the deficiencies imposed. The visual symptoms of deficiency that had appeared firstly were those of phosphorus, boron and iron, respectively. The omissions of the nutrients nitrogen, magnesium and boron were the ones that most compromised the dry matter production of the cherry tomato plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32077/25323,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Modeling of water erosion by the erosion potential method in a pilot subbasin in southern Minas Gerais,"Soil losses due to water erosion threaten the sustainability of agriculture and the food security of current and future generations. This study estimated potential soil losses and sediment production under different types of land uses in a subbasin in the Municipality of Alfenas, southern Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. The objective of this research was to evaluate the application of the Potential Erosion Method by the Intensity of Erosion and Drainage program and correlate the findings with the results obtained by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation as well as geoprocessing techniques and statistical analyses. In the Potential Erosion Method, the coefficient indicating the mean erosion intensity was 0.37, which corresponded to erosion category IV and indicated weak laminar erosion processes, and the total soil loss was 649.31 Mg year-1 and the mean was 1.46 Mg ha-1 year-1. These results were consistent in magnitude with those obtained in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, which estimated a mean soil loss of 1.52 Mg ha-1 year-1 and a total soil loss of 668.26 Mg year-1. The Potential Erosion Method suggests that 1.5% of the area presents potential soil losses above the soil loss tolerance limit, which ranged from 5.19 to 5.90 Mg ha-1 year-1, while the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation indicated that 7.3% of the area has potential soil losses above the limit. The maximum sediment discharge was 60 Mg year-1, meaning that 9.3% of the total soil loss reached the depositional areas of the river plains or watercourses. The Potential Erosion Method was efficient in the evaluation of water erosion in tropical soils, and the results were consistent with models widely employed in the estimation of soil losses. Thus, the model can support the evaluation of soil losses in Brazil and is a robust tool for evaluating the sustainability of agricultural activities.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30999/25321,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Identification and characterization of maize lines resistant to leaf diseases,"Among the maize leaf diseases, white leaf spot, northern leaf blight, gray leaf spot, and southern rust are recognized not only by the potential for grain yield reduction but also by the widespread occurrence in the producing regions of Brazil and the world. The aim of this study was to characterize common maize lines for resistance to white leaf spot, northern leaf blight, gray leaf spot, and southern rust and suggest crosses based on the genetic diversity detected in SNP markers. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with three replications in order to characterize 72 maize lines. Genotypic values were predicted using the REML/BLUP procedure. These 72 lines were genotyped with SNP markers using the 650K platform (Affymetrix®) for the assessment of the genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was quantified using the Tocher and UPGMA methods. The existence of genetic variability for disease resistance was detected among maize lines, which made possible to classify them into three large groups (I, II, and III). The maize lines CD 49 and CD50 showed a good performance and can be considered sources of resistance to diseases. Therefore, their use as gene donors in maize breeding programs is recommended. Considering the information of genetic distance together with high heritability for leaf diseases, backcrossing of parent genotypes with different resistance levels, such as those of the lines CD49 x CD69 and CD50 x CD16, may result in new gene combinations, as they are divergent and meet good performances.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/28899/25320,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Interaction between sugarcane families and plant growth-promoting bacteria in two crop cycles,"The response of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) families to the inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) may show positive or negative interaction values depending on the plant genotype, allowing the selection of responsive genotypes to the association. Based on these precepts, this study aimed to evaluate the response of 27 sugarcane families treated with two PGPB-based inoculants in two sugarcane cycles: plant-cane and first ratoon. Four months after germination, 27 families from crosses between clones of sugarcane were: (T0) not inoculated; (T1) inoculated with Triazo, which consists of a mixture of the strains Abv5, Abv6, and Abv7 of Azospirillum brasilense; and (T2) inoculated with an inoculant called Mix, which contains five strains of PGPB (Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5, Azospirillum amazonense CBAmC, Burkholderia tropica Ppe8, Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans HCc103, and Herbaspirillum seropedicae HRC54). The productivity traits evaluated were the number of stalks, average height, stalk diameter, and Brix. The correlation values between the two cycles were 0.87 for the number of stalks, 0.70 for average height, 0.48 for stalk diameter, and 0.63 for Brix. Differences were observed between treatments for average height, stalk diameter, and Brix. Differences were also observed between families for all the studied traits. Brix was the only parameter that presented a significant interaction between family and inoculant. Different responses were observed between cycles for some families, showing that other factors can also influence the association.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29039/25243,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Seroepidemiological survey for leptospirosis in equines from semiarid region of Paraíba state, Northeastern Brazil","The aim of this survey was to determine epidemiological indicators for leptospirosis in equids from Paraíba state, Northeastern Brazil. A total of 138 equids were sampled from 58 rural properties, and for the diagnosis of leptospirosis it was used the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) with 22 serovars as antigens. A seropositivity found was 40.6% (56/138). The reactive serogroups were Australis (43%), Sejroe (16.3%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (14.3%), Grippotyphosa (10.2%), Canicola (6.1%), Tarassovi (4.1%), Pomona (2%), Ballum (2%) and Hebdomadis (2%). Animals over 36 months of age presented higher chance of get seropositive (odds ratio = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.23 – 7.56; P = 0.016). The results obtained in the present work point to the high occurrence of seropositive equids for Leptospira sp. in the semiarid of Paraíba, Northeastern Brazil. As it is the first report of seropositive equidae in Paraíba, other surveys should be conducted in the region aiming to isolate and identify the agent for the determination of the current infection in the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31775/25709,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Propolis as a potential alternative for the control of Dekkera bruxellensis in bioethanol fermentation,"Dekkera bruxellensis is one of the most important contaminant yeasts of alcoholic fermentation. The use of propolis, which can selectively target contaminating yeasts without affecting the starter one, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, could be a useful nonconventional strategy for controlling the growth of contaminant yeasts. The objective of this research was to evaluate four samples of propolis produced by Apis mellifera honeybees from different regions of Argentina as antimicrobial agents against the growth of D. bruxellensis and S. cerevisiae. Hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis were prepared with ethanol:water (70:30 v/v), and the specific absorbance and final concentration of the samples were evaluated. A qualitative in vitro assay in solid medium was performed with different propolis concentrations, and the evaluation of yeast growth was based on a qualitative scale. A quantitative in vitro assay in liquid medium was also performed to assess the yeast cell number, using two different propolis concentrations. The cell number of D. bruxellensis decreased 1.52 and 1.85 log cycles with the two propolis extracts utilised at a concentration of 4.5 mg mL-1 while the cell number of S. cerevisiae decreased 0.48 and 0.76 log cycles with the same samples of propolis. The results from both assays demonstrated the selectivity of propolis use on the yeast species, leading to a higher inhibition of D. bruxellensis growth. This indicates a good potential for using propolis at the concentration of 4.5 mg mL-1, as a nonconventional strategy to control the growth of D. bruxellensis without significantly affecting S. cerevisiae, the yeast starter of ethanol fermentation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34595/25660,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Bone parameters and organ morphometry of two broiler chicken lines exposed to heat for different periods,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different times of exposure to heat on bone parameters and organ morphometry of Cobb Slow® and Hubbard Flex® broilers exposed to high temperatures for 1, 2 or 3 h daily, from 14 days of age. A total of 1120 one-day-old male chicks (half of each line; average weight of 44 g) were housed into 32 cages with 35 birds each, in a randomized-block experimental design. From the first to the 13th day of age, the birds remained under the thermal conditions recommended for their lines; thereafter, from the 14th day, the shed was separated into four parallel sections of 5.60 × 10.20 × 2.8 m delimited by double-sided plastic curtains along the width of the shed. Cyclic heat stress was generated by average temperatures of 36 ºC from 14-20 days, 35 °C from 21-27 days, 34 °C from 28-34 days and 33 °C from 35-42 days. The total length, width, density and mineral matter of the tibia; the size of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum; and the weights of the bursa of Fabricius and spleen were measured. No interaction effect between thermal environment and line was observed. Heat stress for up to 3 h daily, from the 14th to the 41st day of age, led to a longer but narrower tibia. There was no influence on small intestine morphometry. The Hubbard line presented longer and wider tibiae as well as higher relative and absolute weights of the bursa. In conclusion, heat stress from 2 h daily modifies the structure of the tibia in broilers, which increases in length and reduces in width, but heat exposure has no influence on the small intestine or lymphoid organs. The Hubbard line shows better tibia development than the Cobb line as well as different primary lymphoid responses, represented by a heavier bursa.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34398/25655,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Melatonin concentration in the milk of cows supplemented with vitamins and milked twice daily,"Melatonin, a hormone secreted in cow milk, has beneficial effects on human health. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin supplementation and nocturnal milking on the concentration of melatonin in cow milk. Twenty-one confined cows in the final period of lactation were used for the study and the supplemented vitamins were: rumen-protected B vitamins, A, D3, E, and niacin (B3) not protected from rumen degradation. The experimental period had a duration of 10 days. Milk samples were collected during the first two days, without supplementation of vitamins (WITHOUT), and during the final two days, eight days after the beginning of supplementation (WITH). Samples of milk produced without and with supplementation, milked at 05:00 h (NIGHT) or from the total milk produced in the two daily milkings (TOTAL), were analyzed. The concentration of melatonin was determined by enzyme immunoassay using the ELISA kit, and the results were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey´s test with 5% significance. Supplementation of the diet with vitamins (WITH) did not affect melatonin concentration in TOTAL milk, but it resulted in a concentration 40.55% lower in the NIGHT milk than in the milk from cows without (WITHOUT) supplementation (6.57 vs. 11.06 pg mL",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34449/25656,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment was carried out at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU), Experimental Farm Capim Branco, from 7 December 2016 to 6 January 2017. Ten lambs (Santa Inês × Dorper) aged between four and five months, and with a mean weight of 25.9 ± 2.8 kg, were used. The animals were placed in metabolic cages equipped with a feeder, drinking fountain, and salt shaker, and which had a wooden slatted floor. The treatments consisted of extruded ration with 30R:70C or 70R:30C. Treatments were distributed in a randomised, complete block design, with each treatment being performed twice and with ten replications. The experiment was carried out in two blocked stages. Differences in the means of treatments were evaluated by Tukey’s test at a significance level of 5%. Intake and digestibility of dry matter and nutrients, water intake by animals, and nitrogen balance were also analysed. The 30R:70C treatment resulted in a lower intake of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and hemicellulose, and caused higher dry matter and neutral detergent fibre digestibility. The 30R:70C treatment also resulted in a lower intake and faecal excretion of nitrogen, consequently establishing a higher ratio between retained and ingested nitrogen. In conclusion, the ration with 30R:70C results in lower intake, and better utilisation of nutrients by the animal.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34155/25653,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The dehydration curve was evaluated at 7 time point (0, 13, 18, 22, 37, 42, and 44 hours after cutting) until baling, using five replicates. The time 0 (zero) corresponded to the time before cutting, performed at 19:00 hours. The design was completely randomized with measures repeated over time. Gas exchanges was evaluated 0, 14, and 18 hours after cutting, using 10 replicates. The nutritional value of cowpea hay was evaluated in two open and closed environments (SO and CS), three storage times (30, 60, and 90 days), and five replications. Dehydration of hay was carried out for 44 hours, rapid rates of dehydration was observed in the leaves. Gas exchange was more intense before cutting and up to 14 hours after cutting. Crude protein (CP) content was higher at the time of cutting and decrease after storage. The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content showed no variation between the sampling time and storage systems evaluated.

40,2019,Use of golden mussel and wattle tannin in the supply of cut chickens,"This study aimed to evaluate the use of acacia tannin as a toxic metal adsorbent in the diets of broilers fed with the inclusion of golden mussel meal in substitution for calcitic limestone. In the first trial, 648 male 21-day-old animals were divided among six treatments and six replicates, with 18 birds per experimental unit, organized in a completely randomized design (DIC). The treatments were diets with different acacia tannin levels (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, or 1250 g ton-1). The results indicated that 250 g ton-1 of tannin was not harmful to weight gain, final weight, or feed conversion. Tannin levels caused a decrease in carcass yield and fat deposition and an increase in liver size. For the second trial, 900 male broilers of 21 days of age were used and distributed in a DIC, with different levels of substitution of calcitic limestone by the golden mussel meal (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 %) and supplementation or not with acacia tannins (250 g ton-1), with 5 replicates and each experimental unit being composed of 18 birds. The performance data show that the use of 250 g ton-1 of tannin is detrimental to bone performance and resistance and golden mussel meal can be used to substitute up to 100 % of the limestone in the diets without affecting the variables studied.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33993/25651,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Soybean hulls and / or white oat grains on the ingestive behavior of confined steers,"Dry matter and neutral detergent fiber contents act as physical regulators of voluntary intake in ruminants. Therefore, different levels of these components may interfere with animal performance and require careful assessment of the used raw material. This study was conducted with the purpose to assess the effect of soybean hulls and white oat in distinct or associated uses in the concentrate diet on the ingestive behavior of cattle. Thirty-six steers with an initial mean age of 20 months and initial mean weight of 226 kg were used. The diet was composed of 50% sorghum silage and 50% concentrate based on dry matter. The tested diets were soybean hulls (concentrate fraction composed mainly of soybean hulls), white oat grains (concentrate fraction composed mainly of white oat grains), and mixture (concentrate fraction composed of equal parts of soybean hulls and white oat grains). The experimental design was a randomized block design with 12 animals per diet. The data were compared by the PROC MIXED procedure with repeated measures in time, and the means were compared by the least significant difference test at 5% significance level. Diets presented different contents of neutral detergent fiber (66, 56, and 47%) and lignin (3.2, 3.7, and 4.1%) as the percentage of white oat grain increased in the diet. The total rumination time was lower (447 minutes) for animals that received equal parts of soybean hulls and white oat grains in the diet when compared to animals receiving a diet containing soybean hulls (483 minutes) and white oat grains (495 minutes), with no difference from each other. Animals fed a diet containing soybean hulls and white oat grains showed longer feeding time, a higher number of daily meals, shorter rumination time, shorter time spent chewing, and fewer number of chews per bolus and day. This diet results in a better dry matter and neutral detergent fiber rumination efficiencies.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31839/25649,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from clove and lemongrass against pathogenic bacteria isolated from bovine, swine and poultry feces","The objective was to verify the antibacterial activity of lemongrass and clove oils against Escherichia coli isolated from poultry feces, Staphylococcus aureus isolated from swine and poultry feces and Salmonella sp. isolated from swine and bovine feces. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the disc diffusion test using different concentrations of the oils: 160, 80, 40, 20 and 10 ?l ml -1. The multi-resistance of strains relative to that of conventional antimicrobials was also evaluated by the disk diffusion technique, using Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index. The oils were characterized based on the results of chromatographic analyses, of which, analysis of lemongrass has been previously published (AZEVEDO et al., 2016). Lemongrass and clove essential oils presented citral and eugenol as the major compound, respectively. The concentrations of the essential oils had a significant effect on the extent of the growth inhibition halo and the coefficient of determination (r²) was higher than 0.80. Clove essential oil generated the largest zone of inhibition when tested against Escherichia coli and S. aureus from poultry feces and Salmonella sp. from the feces of swine, while lemongrass essential oil presented better results against S. aureus isolated from swine feces and Salmonella sp. from bovine feces. S. aureus and Salmonella sp. were multi-resistant to the antimicrobials tested. It is concluded that the essential oils tested have antimicrobial activity against bacteria isolated from bovine, swine, and poultry feces and that this activity is proportional to the concentration of oils and the microorganisms studied.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33753/25650,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,The glutaraldehyde test and its use in dairy cattle,"During a physical examination of cattle, it is often difficult to evaluate inflammatory processes, particularly in cases where the inflammation occurs in deeper regions. The glutaraldehyde test (GT), carried out using a sample of whole blood, allows the visual and semiquantitative identification of an inflammatory process in cattle. Considering that there are few biochemical tests that can be used in the field, the objective of this study was to verify the efficacy of the GT in detecting and predicting mild and severe inflammatory processes in bovine species, classified according to a physical examination, and in the presence of different diseases or lesions. The GT was used in conjunction with a physical examination in 176 cows over 12 months of age, with additional laboratory evaluations of packed cell volume, total protein, albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen. Using a cutoff point at 3 minutes of coagulation, the GT showed a sensitivity of 35.1%, specificity of 94.1%, positive predictive value of 74.1%, and negative predictive value of 75.2%. The GT correctly detected the most severe inflammatory processes under the field conditions of this study.

40,2019,"Effect of using trace minerals (copper, zinc, selenium, and manganese) and vitamins A and E on the metabolic profile of Holstein cows in the transition period","The aim of this study was to assess the metaphylactic effect of subcutaneous doses of trace minerals (copper, zinc, selenium, and manganese) and vitamins A and E on biochemical (NEFA, BHBA, fructosamine, urea, triglycerides, HDL, and calcium) and hormonal parameters (cortisol, insulin, and IGF-1) of Holstein cows in the transition period. Sixty animals kept in a semi-confinement system, with an average production of 22 liters of milk per day (Farm 1) and 24 liters of milk per day (Farm 2) and a diet according to NRC (2001) with a low metabolic challenge, were divided into two groups: a treatment group, supplemented with trace minerals and vitamins (MTVG) (n=30), and a control group (CG) (n=30). The collection of blood samples was performed at the moments M1 (21 days prepartum), M2 (14 days prepartum), M3 (7 days prepartum), M4 (parturition day), M5 (7 days postpartum), M6 (14 days postpartum), and M7 (21 days postpartum). The experimental design was a randomized block design and the data were submitted to analysis of variance with repeated measures in time within the random variable cow. Differences were considered significant at 5% significance level and trend at 10% level. No difference was observed between treatment and the interaction treatment × day in the assessed parameters. However, some variables showed a significant difference of day. NEFA levels (P < 0.0001) were higher on the parturition day. BHBA concentrations were higher after parturition (P=0.0031), with a peak at the third week of lactation. Fructosamine showed increasing values until the parturition day (P=0.0373), in which higher concentrations were observed. Average values of HDL were higher at 21 days postpartum (P < 0.0001). Triglycerides levels remained high during the prepartum period but showed a sudden drop on the parturition day (P < 0.0001), with lower values postpartum. Regarding serum calcium and IGF-1, lower values were observed on the parturition day (P < 0.001) for both parameters. Cortisol presented a difference regarding day, with higher values on the parturition day (P=0.0151). Thus, the use of trace minerals and vitamins A and E in animals with an adequate body score and low metabolic challenge presents a low response to biochemical and hormonal parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34122/25645,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Characterization of caseous lymphadenitis in caprine animals slaughtered in a semi-arid region of Brazil,"In the Northeast of Brazil, goat breeding plays an important socioeconomic and strategic role in coexistence within the semi-arid region. The rural nature of the species and adaptations that are appropriate for the climate are some of the characteristics that favor the Northeast as the largest national producer of goats (93% of the national herd). In spite of this, sanitary deficiencies facilitate the appearance and diffusion of pathogenic agents that compromise the productivity, e.g., Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, which are widespread in the national herd and cause damages in the industry. The objective of this study was to characterize caseous lymphadenitis (CL) in lamb cuttings at semi-arid abattoirs. The research was carried out between March and August 2017 at the Municipal Abattoir of Patos, State of Paraíba, Brazil, where the caprines from this region are slaughtered. We studied 304 animals with no defined racial pattern, of both the sexes, characterized according to their age group as evidenced by their teeth, submitted to ante- and post-mortem examinations with microbiological confirmation. Cheek material was processed for diagnostic confirmation, using the techniques of isolation and microbiological identification (gold standard). The bacteriological examination confirmed the presence of the agent in 21.38% of the animals, in which 13.16% were females and 8.22% were males. Of those affected, 11.51% had the clinical form of the disease, while 9.87% had the subclinical form and 1.31% had both the clinical form as well as the internal impairment. The precrural (25.71%), mammary (11.43%), and prescapular (11.43%) lymph nodes were the most affected. Internally, the most affected were the liver (63.33%), lung (13.33%), and medium mediastinal lymph nodes (10%). The presence of skin lesion/scars (Odds ratio = 2.394, 95% CI = 1.371 - 4.182, p = 0.003) and sex (females) (Odds ratio = 1.845, 95% CI = 1.053 - 3.232, p = 0.044) were found to be risk factors. CL is present in goats from the intermediate geographical region of Patos, reinforcing the need for control measures, with attention to the inspection of animals in the slaughter line.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33738/25644,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,An epidemiological study of caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) in breeder goats from Northeastern Brazil,"Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) is a retrovirus that infects goats. This study evaluated the prevalence of CAEV in breeder goats from the states of Maranhão, Ceará, Piauí, Alagoas, Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraíba. We collected a total of 531 serum samples from 251 properties. On average, two male breeder goats were examined from each farm. Results from western blotting demonstrated that the prevalence of CAEV was 6.2% (32/513). In each state, the following prevalence values were found: Piauí, 5.9% (7/119); Maranhão, 2.0% (01/48); Sergipe, 7.1% (03/42); Alagoas, 17.6% (03/17); Rio Grande do Norte, 4.7% (05/105); Paraíba, 2.1% (02/94); and Ceará, 12.5% (11/34). We also conducted a univariate analysis to determine the risk factors that are associated with CAEV. This analysis revealed that breeding season, records of herd data, criteria adopted for the first mating of females, castration of male goats, origin of breeders, and identification of the animal were associated with CAEV. Adopting control measures to identify CAEV-positive animals and avoid virus transmission to females, especially during breeding seasons, is crucial since, males carrying CAEV can be sources of infection for the entire herd.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33617/25643,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Microvessel density assessment in canine mammary carcinomas as a predictive factor for metronomic chemotherapy,"The canine mammary tumor is the neoplasia that most commonly affects intact female dogs (not spayed) in routine veterinary practice. Canine mammary tumor therapy is a challenge because only few effective treatments have been described for high-grade tumors in veterinary medicine. One such therapeutic option that slows down tumor growth is metronomic chemotherapy (MC), a therapeutic modality that acts by decreasing tumor angiogenesis. Quantification of intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) has been proposed as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of MC in human and canine tumors. In this study, MVD is proposed as a predictive factor for the effectiveness of MC in canine mammary tumors. Twenty female dogs with mammary carcinoma were equally distributed into a mastectomy group treated only with mastectomy, and a MC group treated with MC (cyclophosphamide and piroxicam) orally and daily for 28 days followed by mastectomy. Mammary tumors were classified and graded histologically. MVD was ascertained by CD31 immunostaining. The analysis showed statistically significant difference in MVD scores between groups, corroborating a quantitative reduction in tumor microvasculature in the group treated with MC. Our findings suggest that MVD may be an important predictive factor for the selection of female dogs with malignant mammary tumors that may benefit from MC.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33018/25642,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Protective efficacy of commercial vaccines against a virulent field strain of Clostridium chauvoei,"Blackleg is an acute and frequently fatal infection that mainly affects cattle and is caused by Clostridium chauvoei. Formalin-killed, whole-cell vaccines are commonly used to control blackleg. The aim of this study was to verify the protective efficacy of two commercial vaccines against the infection of guinea pigs with two strains of C. chauvoei, a virulent field strain (SBP 07/09) and the reference strain used in official tests (Manguinhos-Teixeira or MT). The strains used in the challenge were characterized by whole genome sequencing, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 15 antimicrobials were determined. To assess the protective efficacy, guinea pigs were vaccinated and subsequently challenged with C. chauvoei. All four vaccinated and challenged groups seroconverted after vaccination, while the control group remained seronegative, as determined by indirect ELISA. The identical performance of the two C. chauvoei strains in terms of virulence after challenge and their inability to infect vaccinated animals was correlated with their high genetic homology. Both commercial vaccines showed good protective efficacy against both the reference and field strains. Although C. chauvoei vaccination failures have been reported, the results from our study and others reported high similarity among C. chauvoei strains from all over the world, which suggests that the vaccine failures are not due to antigenic variability but inadequate vaccine management.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32898/25641,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Management and population fluctuation of cassava mealybug Phenacoccus manihoti Matile-Ferrero (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae),"Cassava is one of the main foods in Brazil, playing a key role in the diet of several communities. In the Central-Southern region of Brazil, several pests are associated with cassava, among which the cassava mealybug stands out due to its high potential for damage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the population dynamics and the effect of pruning and different cassava management on the developmental stages of mealybug, Phenacoccus. manihoti. The experiment was conducted in Santa Monica, PR, with ‘Cauiá’ cultivar, involving a randomized complete block design with four replications and six treatments: 1) No pruning: intact plants, 2) Pruning soil: pruned close to the soil without plant material, 3) Pruning at 15 cm: conventional pruning at 15 cm of the soil with vegetative material, 4) Pruning + branches: conventional pruning, with the middle portion of the plant in the plot and removal of the apical region of the plant, 5) Pruning + apical: conventional pruning, with the removal of the middle portion of the plant and retaining the apical parts of the plant, and 6) Pruning - branches - apical: conventional pruning, with the removal of the middle and apical portions of the plant. After 7-days of pruning, the number of eggs, nymphs, and adults were counted, and the population variation was monitored at weekly interval for a month. For the insect count, four sites were randomly chosen in a zigzag manner within each plot and four plants were evaluated, totaling 16 plants per plot. Based on the counts, the percentage of plants with eggs, nymphs, and adults was calculated. The data of the variables were transformed by ?(x+5), subjected to analysis of variance and Scott Knot test (5%). The percentage of plants with egg mass and adults of P. manihoti was highest in plots that had no pruning. The pruning close to the soil combined with the removal of vegetative material resulted in plants with fewest eggs of P. manihoti. Removal of the apical region portion of the cassava plant reduced the number of P. manihoti nymphs and adults.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33622/25689,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Accelerated aging test for forage pea seeds,"Forage pea is an important annual, cold climate crop with high levels of essential amino acids in its seeds, which are lacking in the composition of cereal grains. Therefore, livestock farmers use its seeds as a nutritious source of forage. To plant fields of this forage, it is necessary to know the quality of the seeds, determined through germination and vigor tests. In the literature, studies on vigor tests for forage pea seeds are scarce. This study aimed to verify the efficiency of vigor tests, with emphasis on accelerated aging to evaluate the physiological quality of forage pea seeds in order to select lots for seedling emergence in the field. Using accelerated aging tests, 10 lots of forage pea were evaluated for moisture content, thousand-seed weight, emergence percentage, emergence first count, speed index of seedlings in the field, germination, germination first count, and electrical conductivity. The following variations of methodology were used: temperatures of 41 and 42 °C, exposure times of 48 and 72 h, and different relative humidity values in the aging atmosphere, using distilled water (100 % RH), saturated solution of potassium chloride (87 % RH), and sodium chloride (76 % RH). The tests of germination, emergence first count of seedlings in the field, emergence speed index, and electrical conductivity are promising to evaluate the vigor of forage pea seed lots. The accelerated aging test conducted in a solution saturated with potassium chloride at 42 °C for 48 h is adequate to estimate the vigor of forage pea seed lots, providing information similar to that of the emergence of seedlings in the field.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33121/25639,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Comparative epidemiology of late blight and early blight of potato under different environmental conditions and fungicide application programs,"Three experiments were carried out in an experimental field from Viçosa city, Minas Gerais, Brazil, to compare late blight (LB) (Phytophthora infestans) and early blight (EB) (Alternaria grandis) epidemics under different environmental conditions and fungicide application programs. Each experiment consisted of two side-by-side trials that were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five treatments and five replications. At 30 days after planting the potato (‘Ágata’ cultivar) plants in plots of trials 1 and 2 were inoculated with an isolate of P. infestans (A2 mating type) and four isolates of A. grandis, respectively. Fungicide applications were initiated at seven days after inoculation and repeated at 7- or 15-day intervals. The severity of LB and EB was assessed every two days, and the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated for both diseases. The yield was quantified by weighing the tubers of all the plants from each plot after their maturation. Yield data were converted into kg ha-1 and the percentage of loss was calculated for each treatment. Based on the AUDPC, the LB severity was greater than the EB severity under all three environmental conditions, and this was reflected in the yield. LB and EB caused yield losses as high as of 82 and 45%, respectively. The fungicide effects on both LB and EB and the associated yield losses changed according to the environmental conditions, therefore, indicating the importance of using tools such as a forecast system to help farmers to decide the best time for fungicide application.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32994/25638,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Coleopterans prospection associated to forest ecosystems of Swietenia macrophylla (King), Eastern Amazonia","Few research on the entomofauna associated to forest plantations with Swietenia macrophylla (King) in Brazil has been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the Coleoptera communities in forest ecosystems with S. macrophylla, Brazilian mahogany, with emphasis on the diversity of families and the main functional groups. The insects were collected through pitfall traps in three forest ecosystems: monoculture, consortium and forest enriched with Brazilian mahogany, during dry and rainy periods in two consecutive years. The identification of the captured insects occurred in the entomology laboratory of the Federal Rural University of Amazonia. The analysis was performed through Past Paleontological Statistic 3.14 and ANAFAU, where the difference was considered significant only when p ? 0.05. 11,358 specimens from 21 families were captured, of which 8,058 were sampled in the rainy season and 3,299 in the dry season. There was influence of seasonality and types of forest ecosystems during collection. The families Nitidulidae, Staphylinidae, Carabidae and Meloidae presented greater abundance and richness in the complex ecosystems. Anobiidae, Cerambycidae, Bostrichidae, Brentidae, Buprestidae, Curculionidae, Elateridae, Chrysomelidae and Lagriidae were considered to be pests and common to all studied ecosystems; however, the families Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae, Tenebrionidae and Passalidae had the function of decomposers; Carabidae, Coccinellidae, Histeridae, Meloidae, Staphylinidae, Cantharidae and Hydrophilidae were the predators.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31865/25636,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Soybean seed origin effects on physiological and sanitary quality and crop yield,"The suitable establishment of a crop depends on seed quality, among another factors. However, with high production costs many producers use uncertified seeds, to reduce expenses with this input at sowing time. The objective was to evaluate germination, vigor and health of soybean seeds, diseases incidence in cvs. NS 5445 IPRO and BMX Ativa RR, whose seeds were of certified and uncertified origins, as well as yield components and grain yield of soybeans, with or without fungicides application. The experiments were conducted in the 2015/16 and 2016/17 crop season, in Erechim-RS. Two experiments were carried out in a completely randomized design (DIC): one in the laboratory, under a 2 x 2 factorial scheme (cultivar x origin); and another in the field in a homogeneous area, in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme (with/without fungicide application and certified/uncertified seed) for two cultivars, both with four replications. The variables evaluated were: germination and seed health, yield (kg ha-1), thousand grains weight (g), number of grains per plant, and incidence of foliar fungal diseases. The main fungi identified in seeds were Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp. and Fusarium sp. The highest incidence percentage were obtained in uncertifed seeds, at two harvests. Both cultivars and origins presented the minimum germination required for commercialization, however, certified seeds had better performance for seed vigor. As for normal seedlings, there was a significant difference only for the 2016/17 crop season, with the highest percentage obtained in certified seeds (52.0% for NS 5445 and 73.5% for BMX Ativa). Best productivity was achieved with cultivation of certified seeds associated with fungicides in both crops and cultivars. For thousand grains weight (TGW) there was no difference in origin, but only for cultivar and fungicides apply. The number of grains per plant was higher in plants from certified seeds and that received fungicides, being cv. BMX Ativa the most responsive for the two harvests analyzed. The main diseases found in the two harvests were: Asian rust, powdery mildew, mildew, septoriosis and cercosporiosis. However, seed origin, in both crops, did not differ in the incidence of Asian rust, powdery mildew and mildew, but for septoriosis and cercosporiosis, considered soybean late season diseases, seed origin is a determining fator.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32187/25663,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Comparison of non-parametric indexes to select soybean genotypes obtained by recurrent selection,"In the final steps of a breeding program, it is necessary to evaluate several traits, which makes it difficult to select the superior genotypes. This study aimed to compare nonlinear indexes in the selection of superior soybean inbred lines obtained by recurrent selection. The experiment was carried out in Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil. During the 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons, 67 soybean inbred lines and two commercial controls (BMX Potência RR and NK 7059 RR) were evaluated. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replicates. The evaluated traits were: days to maturity, agronomic value, lodging, first pod insertion height, and grain yield. A combined analysis of variance for seasons was performed and the sum of ranks index, ideotype distance index, and cultivars selection index were applied. All traits were significant for the genotypic source of variation and showed complex genotype × environment interactions. The selection indexes were consistent with each other. The ideotype and cultivar selection index showed higher concordance on indication of 15 superior inbred lines with a coefficient of coincidence of 80%. The inbred lines SR-03, SR-12, SR-22, SR-41, SR-49, SR-55, SR-61, and SR-62 were indicated for all indexes and are therefore considered superior to other inbred lines.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31135/25635,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Physiological potential of Physalis peruviana L. seeds under different temperatures and light wavelengths,"Physalis peruviana L. is a plant that produces small sweet berries of great nutritional and medicinal importance. This plant is propagated mainly through seeds, which requires information on germination response to temperature and light changes. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of different temperatures and light wavelengths on the physiological potential of P. peruviana seed batches. The experiment was conducted with seeds from plants cultivated in 2015/15 and 2016/16. The treatments applied were the following: two germination temperatures (constant temperature of 25 °C and alternated between 20/30 °C), two seed batches (2015/15 and 2016/16), and four forms of light exposure during germination (blue, red, white, and dark). The data were analyzed by principal component analysis using the correlation matrix obtained through the standardized mean equal to zero and variance 1 of the parameters evaluated for each treatment. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix were obtained using the SAS University Edition® statistical software. The analyzed variables were: Germination test performed on the 7th and 28th day considering root protrusion, normal seedlings, shoot length, root length, and total dry matter mass. The data showed that the seed germination test of Physalis peruviana L. should be performed under a constant temperature of 25 °C, in the presence of light (white, blue, or red). When the option is the application of the test in the dark, it is necessary to use a thermoperiod of 20–30 °C to provide the expression of maximum physiological potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30087/25632,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effect of the fertilization and growth promoting microrganisms on Schizolobium parahyba,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the chemical and biological fertilizing on the development of two varieties of Schizolobium parahyba, paricá and guapuruvú. The chemical fertilizer NPK 20-05-20 and the plant growth promoting microorganisms, Rhizobium sp. (Rhi) and Rhizophagus clarus (Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus - AMF). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with five replicates and eight treatments. Forty-six day old seedlings of each variety were planted in pits containing hydroretent gel. Then the treatments were added: 1. Control; 2. Rhi; 3. AMF; 4. NPK; 5. Rhi + NPK; 6. Rhi + AMF; 7. AMF + NPK; 8. Rhi + AMF + NPK. Plant length, stem diameter and survival in the environment were evaluated. The ANOVA followed by the Duncan test (? = 0,05) was used to compare the means of the treatments. In the four evaluated periods (37, 111, 250 and 360 days), both varieties had a positive effect on height, diameter and survival when applied to NPK treatments. The interaction AMF and Rhizobium sp. favored the growth in diameter of the guapuruvú. For paricá variety that same treatment provided higher growth in height, however, AMF impaired development in diameter of this variety. Thus, it was observed that under low fertility conditions, the interaction AMF + Rhi favored a greater resistance of guapuruvú to abiotic stress compared to treatment 3, and the presence of grasses in the experimental area may have contributed to the reduction on the development of S. parahyba.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31121/25633,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Determination of ptaquiloside in cow's milk by HPLC-UV,"Ferns of the genus Pteridium are known to be responsible for cases of poisoning in cattle. The commonly found species of Pteridium in Brazil are P. arachnoideum and P. caudatum. The toxic principle of these ferns is ptaquiloside, a norsesquiterpene glucoside, which is a known carcinogen. Ptaquiloside can be secreted in the milk of cows grazing on bracken ferns, thereby posing a potential health risk for the milk consumers. The objective of the present study was to develop an analytical methodology using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection to determine the concentrations of ptaquiloside in cow´s milk. HPLC-UV method, based on the conversion of ptaquiloside into pterosin B and its subsequent extraction using dichloromethane, was successfully developed for estimating concentrations of ptaquiloside in milk samples. However, the presence of ptaquiloside was not detected in milk samples obtained from cows with a history of bovine enzootic hematuria resulting from grazing on P. arachnoideum infested pastures in Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33751/25472,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Carbon in aggregate size classes in a Rhodic Eutrudox under different cropping systems,"Soil productive capacity is related to levels of carbon (C) in aggregates of different sizes. The aim of this study was to assess total organic carbon levels in different size classes of water-stable aggregates in a Rhodic Eutrudox under different production systems. The cropping systems assessed were no-tillage (NT); no-tillage scarified every three years (NTS); disk plowing (DP) and heavy disking (HD). All systems were subjected to crop succession (S) (soybean - Glycine max / wheat - Triticum aestivum) and rotation (R) (soybean, maize (Zea mays), wheat) and cover and green manure (Lupinus albus, Raphanus sativus and Avena strigosa). Intact soil samples were collected in trenches at depths of 0–0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20–0.30 and 0.30-0.40 m. The highest levels of carbon were found under no-tillage, irrespective of the aggregate size class. In all treatments, the top layer (0.0–0,10 m) under crop succession showed the highest carbon content for all aggregate size classes. However, at depths below 0.10 m, crop rotation exhibited the highest carbon levels (between 12 and 20 g kg-1). After 29 years of trials, cropping systems with the lowest soil disturbance combined with crop rotation were found to contribute to raising the level of carbon in the soil and maintaining stable aggregates.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33100/25471,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Qualitative monitoring of corn silage stored in commercial bunker silos and used as feed for dairy cattle in the western region of Santa Catarina State, Brazil","Corn ensiling is a feed preservation practice used for ruminant production. During the process of making and opening the silos, the quality of the silage may change due to the entrance of air, which can cause damage and decrease the voluntary intake of the animals. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of corn silages during their use in commercial bunker silos, as well as to correlate this with qualitative and quantitative characteristics related to the silage making process. Technical data on silage making and samples were collected from 14 bunker silos, with five samples collected along each silo (at 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of their lengths); additionally, two sampling methodologies were compared (“W” vs. layer collections in silo panels: top, middle and bottom). The values for the pH and titratable acidity (TA) were significant (p < 0.05) in relation to the sampling method, where the pH of the top was higher (3.8±0.5) than that of the middle and the bottom layers (3.6±0.3 and 3.5±0.3); therefore, the TA was lower in the top of the silos. The dry matter, ashes, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, pH, TA, as well as the silo sampling method during the unloading of commercial bunker silos did not differ for any of the variables (p < 0.05). Also, the particle size did not differ during the unloading of the commercial bunker silos (p > 0.05). According to the collected technical data, 78.57% of the bunker silos were built directly on the ground, the harvesting equipment was mostly borrowed from municipalities or farmers’ associations (for 35.7 and 28.5% of the farms, respectively), and in only 64.2% of the farms, the harvester was sharpened before silage cutting. Good practices were applied during the corn silage process and throughout the use of the silos, homogeneous quality was detected in the western region of Santa Catarina. Either “W” or layer collections can be used to sample corn silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34609/25470,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Milk fatty acid composition of Holstein x Gyr dairy cows fed sugarcane-based diets containing citrus pulp supplemented with sunflower oil,"Sugarcane is a strategic roughage source for milk production in the tropics, and its supplementation with plant oils offers great potential for obtaining milk enriched with beneficial fatty acids, such as oleic (cis-9 C18:1), vaccenic (trans-11 C18:1), and rumenic (cis-9, trans-11 CLA) acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the milk fatty acid composition of cows fed 60% chopped sugarcane-based diets containing citrus pulp and 0.0% (control), 1.5%, 3.0% and 4.5% sunflower oil on a dry matter basis. Twelve multiparous Holstein x Gyr dairy cows with an average milk production of 17±5 kg day-1 and 96±25 days in milk were allocated in a triplicate 4 x 4 Latin square design. There was no effect of dietary treatment on milk production, but sunflower oil supplementation linearly reduced the milk fat content and yield. The milk fat contents of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), and palmitic (C16:0) fatty acids were linearly reduced with increasing sunflower oil levels. There was a quadratic effect on the milk fat oleic, vaccenic, and rumenic acid contents, while the concentrations of elaidic acid (trans-9 C18:1), trans-10 C18:1 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA linearly increased in response to sunflower oil inclusion. Diet supplementation with sunflower oil linearly reduced both the atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indices and linearly increased the ratio between hypo- and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids in milk fat. The inclusion of up to 4.5% sunflower oil in 60% chopped sugarcane-based diets improved the nutritional quality of milk fat from Holstein x Gyr dairy cows as a result of the increased content of oleic, rumenic and vaccenic acids, which are beneficial to human health, and the concomitant reduction of hypercholesterolemic lauric, myristic and palmitic acids. However, there was an increase in the milk content of trans-10 C18:1 and elaidic acid, which are associated with deleterious effects on cardiovascular health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34476/25468,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Replacing oat hay with coffee husk in the feed of finishing lambs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of replacing oat hay with coffee husk for the feeding of confined lambs. In this study, 24 male Texel lambs of approximately 60 days of age and with a mean ± standard error weight of 21.95 ± 5.81 kg were examined. Their diet was composed of 30% oat hay and 70% concentrated feed per kilogram of dry matter. The experimental design was randomized and included four treatments (0, 7.5, 15, and 22.5% of coffee husk in the total dry matter), with six replicates of each treatment. The animals were slaughtered when they reached a mean live weight of 32 kg. There was no significant difference in dry matter intake and mean daily weight gain (which were 197 g day-1) among treatments. The mean daily weight gain (DWG) was not significantly affected (P > 0.05) by the replacement of oat hay with coffee husk in the diet, with the overall mean DWG being 215.05 g day-1. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) among treatments in any of the studied carcass variables, and the mean true carcass yield was 53.9%. The lambs presented a mean finishing score of 2.96 (on a scale of 1 to 5) and a conformation of 4.21 (on a scale of 1 to 6), characterizing them as good carcasses. In terms of economic viability, the 7.5% diet stood out as the one that had the highest profitability, generating a profit of $ 3.25 USD per kg of carcass produced. Coffee husk can therefore replace oat hay in the feed of finishing lambs in concentrations of 0.075 to 0.225 kg kg-¹ of total dry matter with biological and economical efficacy and generating good commercial carcasses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34154/25501,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Quality of fresh and aged meat from lambs fed peanut meal and glycerin,"Abstract: Were evaluated the microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of fresh and aged semimembranosus muscle from 40 uncastrated male Ile de France lambs with 17.15 ± 1.56 kg of initial body weight. Treatments involved fresh and meat aged for 14 days at 4 ºC from lambs receiving four diets, as follows: control; PM - diet with 20% peanut meal replacing soybean meal; G - diet with 25% glycerin replacing corn; and PMG - diet with 10% peanut meal and 12.5% glycerin. The forage:concentrate ratio was 40:60, and corn silage was used as roughage. The diets had similar values of crude protein and metabolizable energy (17.47% and 2.72 Mcal kg/dry matter). A completely randomized design was adopted in a 4×2 factorial arrangement (four diets × fresh and aged meat). Diets and aging did not favor the development of microorganisms in the meat. There was an interaction effect between diets and aging for pH, color, cooking weight loss (CL), and shear force (SF). The fresh meat from animals fed G was lighter compared with the meat from those consuming PM and PMG (lightness of 38.45, 36.26 and 37.88 respectively). Aging increased lightness (37.63 to 40.87), red intensity (15.12 to 15.93), yellow intensity (2.48 to 3.42) and CL (23.84 to 32.59%), reduced pH (5.66 to 5.45), water holding capacity (61.85 to 58.87%) and SF (22.60 to 16.95 N). By-products from biodiesel and peanut production can be used to replace corn and soybean meal in diets for lambs without compromising their meat quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34092/25464,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Production behavior and prices of beef cattle in the Brazilian Amazon,"This study evaluates the production behavior and prices in the beef cattle industry in the Brazilian Amazon. We used time series data obtained from various sources and employed multiple regression and polynomial regression analysis. For the price analysis, we used the classical time series model and separated the seasonal and cyclic indices based on the 12-month centered moving average. The analyses covered the period from 1990 to 2015, when the regional cattle population grew at a rate of 5% per year, compared to the national growth rate of 1.7%. The price analysis reveals the existence of cycles in regional cattle ranching, defined mainly by an inverse correlation between the price of fattened cattle and the slaughter of matrices. As for the variables determining the growth of the cattle population, we find that rural credit policy assumes an important role in enabling the supply of resources for financing livestock projects that are more popular than investments in agriculture. The creation and structuring of state agricultural defense agencies in the late 1990s represents an important measure in the institutional sphere, as the implementation of animal health policies and programs has generated a favorable environment for the expansion of investments in meat production and processing, in addition to opening up opportunities for trade in the domestic and international markets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34144/25466,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effect of age and genetic group on the development of calves weaned at 63 days until one year of age,"The development of beef calves born of Charolais (CH), Nellore (N), and Charolais × Nellore crossbred cows with Charolais (CHP) and Nellore (NP) predominance, was evaluated from birth to 12 months of age. The cows were grouped into three age classes: primiparous, young and adult. The net energy requirements for maintenance and gain of the calves were also evaluated, as were the production and availability of energy in the milk of the evaluated cows. We used 93 pairs of contemporary cows and calves maintained in natural pasture. From birth to 21 days of age and from 21 to 42 days of age, the calves of adult cows presented the highest average daily weight gain (ADG), while the calves of young and primiparous cows had similar ADG. The highest net energy requirements for maintenance (NEm) and gain (NEg) were for crossbred and Charolais calves, the latter being similar to Nellore calves. The energy available in the milk of the adult cows was 33% higher than that of primiparous cows. The weight gain of calves was influenced by the age of the cow until weaning. The pre-weaning and post-weaning weights of calves were affected by the genetic group, and adult and young cows produced heavier calves in the pre-weaning period than primiparous cows.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34105/25465,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Seasonal variations in thermoregulatory patterns enable Morada Nova sheep to adapt to Brazilian semi-arid,"The present study aimed evaluate possible modifications of thermoregulatory morphophysiological responses of Morada Nova sheep throughout the year in 4 properties of the nucleus of participatory genetic breeding. In the months of March, June, September and December, respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperatures (RT) and surface (ST) were recorded as well as the environmental variables air temperature (airT), relative humidity (RH) wind (Ws). Calculated the radiant heat load (RHL) and the Black Globe Humidity Index (BGHI). The coat thickness was measured and hair samples were collected and determined hair density, hair length and hair diameter. Blood collection was collected for determination of T3 and total T4 concentrations. In the rainy season, which includes the months of March and June, higher values of RR and RT, probably due to the combination of high RH, associated to RHL, BGHI and airT were recorded, as these hamper loss and heat. All values of RT independent of month and flocks remained within values considered normal for the species. September and December are inserted in the dry season, with a low RH factor that can facilitate heat loss through evaporation. In these months, lower values of RT and RR were observed when compared to the rainy season, lower values of RR were recorded between 40 and 60 mov.min-1 . The secretion of thyroid hormones was greater in the environmental conditions considered more comfortable. The homeothermia was maintained by Morada Nova sheep at different times evaluated as indicated by the normal physiological parameters. The rainy season was considered the most stressful for the animals, since they used a more intense set of variables in order to thermoregulate and maintain the homeothermia, which justifies the importance of providing shelters, with the objective of reducing the overheating, even in view of their great adaptive capacity, already demonstrated in previous studies. Changes in the coat characteristics were observed during all the months of the year, assisting for either physical protection or heat dissipation and could therefore be indicated as a thermotolerance phenotypic marker with the potential to be used as selection criteria in breeding programs and conservation of resistant animals to heat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33678/25461,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Productive and structural responses of Urochloa brizantha cv. piatã subjected to management strategies,"This experiment was carried out to evaluate management strategies for Piatã grass grown in the soil-climatic conditions of the south region of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. The treatments corresponded to four management strategies determined by the following pre- and post-harvest heights: 30/10, 30/15, 35/20 and 40/15. A completely randomized design with five replications was employed totaling twenty experimental units. The highest number of harvests was observed in the plots subjected to strategies 35/20 and 30/15, which allowed for two additional harvest cycles when compared with strategies 40/15 and 30/10. The strategies that provided plants with the greatest pre-harvest heights, 40/15 and 35/20, resulted in lower leaf elongation rates, stem elongation rates, and leaf senescence. Because of the lower post-harvest height, strategy 30/10 resulted in the largest tiller population, an average of 829 tillers m2. The highest herbage accumulation value, 18.600 kg ha-1 DM, was observed with management strategies 40/15 and 30/15. The management of Piatã grass based on the harvest target of 30/15 associates elevated herbage production with a favorable pasture structure for grazing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33620/25459,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Supplementation strategies and their effects on ewes colostrum and milk compositions in the initial third lactation period,"The objective of this study was to analyze colostrum and milk compositions of ewes kept in pasture receiving different types/levels of supplementation and to analyze milk composition variation throughout the initial third lactation period. After confirmation of pregnancy, 54 ewes were kept in pasture and supplemented from the final third of gestation until weaning with multiple mixture or concentrate (0.4% or 0.8% of body weight). Milk collections were carried out in the postpartum period to collect colostrum (day 0), and on the seventh, 14th, 21st and 28th milking days. Samples were obtained by manual milking and analyzed for protein, fat, casein, lactose, total solids and defatted dry extract. No effects from the different types of supplementation were observed on the colostrum composition or in relation to milk composition. An effect of supplementation was only found for lactose contents, which were higher for animals that consumed a higher level of supplementation. In relation to the milking days, a linear decrease in protein, casein, total solids and defatted dry extract contents was observed between the seventh and the 28th day of lactation. No interaction between type of supplementation and the milking days was observed. The different types of supplementation did not alter the colostrum composition of Santa Inês crossbred ewes, however they had an influence on milk composition. Protein, casein, total solids and defatted dry extract decrease linearly between the seventh and the 28th day of lactation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33147/25457,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,The effect of combinations of dried or ensiled corn and sorghum on the performance of feedlot lambs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of combinations of dry and moist corn and sorghum grain on the carcass and cut characteristics of crossbred lambs Suffolk x Santa Inês produced in feedlots. The experimental design was a randomized block with four treatments and three replicates. Sixty uncastrated male lambs with an initial average weight of 15.5 kg were used in this experiment. Four combinations of grain were evaluated: dry sorghum milled + silage of high-moisture sorghum grain (DS: MS); dry corn milled + silage of high-moisture sorghum grain (DC:MS); dry corn milled + silage of high-moisture corn grain (DC:MC); dry sorghum milled + silage of high-moisture corn grain (DS:MC). There was no difference between treatments for carcass yield, warm and cold carcass weight and for cooling loss. The slaughtering weights of lambs fed DC:MS associations were higher (29.46 kg) than lambs fed DC: MC (24.17 kg), but both did not differ DS:MS (26.18 kg) and DS:MC (25.21 kg). There was influence of the grain associations on the yield of commercial cuts palette and shank. Combinations of corn and sorghum grain, dried and ensiled, can be used to feed lambs in confinement for meat production without affecting the quality of the carcass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33520/25458,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Seroprevalence and predominant serogroups of Leptospira sp. in serological tests of ruminants in northeastern Brazil,"The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis and the predominant serogroups in serological tests of ruminants performed at the Transmissible Diseases Laboratory of the Federal University of Campina Grande, Patos, Paraíba, northeastern Brazil, between 2010 and 2017. This research included the records of serological tests for leptospirosis from 5594 animals, including 1527 cattle, 1761 goats, 2170 sheep, and 136 buffaloes from four Brazilian states (Paraíba, Pernambuco, Maranhão, and Rio Grande do Norte). Of the 5594 serum samples, 662 were serologically positive, corresponding to a frequency of 11.8%. Serjoe (30.6%), Autumnalis (13.6%), and Icterohaemorrhagiae (11.3%) were the most frequent subgroups among all species. The individual frequencies in cattle, goats, sheep, and buffaloes were 20% (306/1527), 8.3% (147/1761), 7.9% (171/2170), and 27.9% (38/136), respectively, with titers ranging from 1:100 to 1:3200. The most frequent serogroups according to animal species were as follows: Serjoe predominated in cattle (62%), followed by Icterohaemorrhagiae (12.5%) and Tarassovi (6.6%); Autumnalis was the most frequent in goats and sheep (29.4% and 26.9%, respectively), followed by Seramanga (12.5%) in goats and Icterohaemmorrhagiae (13.5%) in sheep; and Australis predominated in buffaloes (39.5%), followed by Pomona (31.6%) and Canicola (21.1%). Leptospira sp. infection, determined by serology, is widespread in ruminants (cattle, goats, sheep, and buffaloes) in northeastern Brazil, suggesting the existence of alternative transmission routes that are less dependent on environmental factors. Identification of the most frequent serogroups highlights the need to improve sanitary conditions, and implement efficient and targeted control measures directed at the primary infection sources.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34034/25499,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,In vitro embryos production of oocytes selected based on follicular size and by brilliant cresyl blue staining,"We evaluated the competence of bovine oocytes via morphological selection associated with follicular diameter and by brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) staining, in order to improve oocyte selection and the efficiency of in vitro embryo production. Follicles with small (2 < 4 mm), large (4–8 mm) or mixed (2–8 mm) diameters were aspirated from slaughterhouse ovaries. Next, the morphologically categorized oocytes were stained and evaluated with 26 ?M of BCB (90 min), followed by an assessment of in vitro maturation (MII) and blastocyst production. Oocytes from the large (61.1 ± 3.9%) and mixed (52.9 ± 4.6%) follicular groups showed comparable (p > 0,05) BCB+ rates, but both differed (p < 0.05) as compared to the small-diameter group (41.0 ± 4.5%). Between the BCB+ and BCB – oocytes, there was no difference (p > 0,05) in MII rate in the mixed (respectively 86.7 ± 3.4 and 75.8 ± 2.2), large (respectively 89.4 ± 2.6 and 79.7 ± 2.3) and small (respectively 76.7 ± 2.9 and 67.2 ± 2.5) diameter groups. Comparing BCB (+ and -) oocytes, we observed (p > 0,05) no change in the percentage of embryos in the large group (respectively 67.3 ± 3.3 and 53.5 ± 5.8) and in the small group (respectively 43.8 ± 5.3 and 33.9 ± 2.2), but there was a difference (p < 0.05) in the mixed group (respectively 57.8 ± 3.9 and 39.6 ± 7.5). Furthermore, when we compared between follicular groups, the BCB+/large-diameter group (61.1 ± 3.9%) had a significant higher percentage of embryos (p < 0.05) than the small-diameter BCB+ (43.8 ± 5.3) groups. To conclude, selection procedures that use follicle size and/or BCB staining may be used as an additional tool to improve the in vitro production of embryos.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34067/25456,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Use of hormonal subdoses applied in Bai Hui acupuncture in estrus synchronization protocols for goats,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of delivering reduced doses of hormones via the Bai Hui acupoint in estrus synchronization in goats. A total of 40 goats received intravaginal sponges with medroxyprogesterone acetate for 7 days. The goats were then randomly distributed into 5 treatment: T1 - application of 132.5 ?g of cloprostenol and 300 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), both by intramuscular injection (IM); T2 - application of 39.75 ?g cloprostenol at the Bai Hui acupoint, and 300 IU of eCG by IM; T3 - application of 132.5 ?g of cloprostenol by IM, and 90 IU of eCG at the Bai Hui acupoint; T4 - application of 39.75?g of cloprostenol and 90 UI of eCG, both in Bai Hui and T5 acupuncture: application of 39.75?g of cloprostenol and 90 UI of eCG, both applied in false acupoint. The goats were subjected to an estrus synchronization protocol and monitored for estrus detection, coverage and evaluation of reproductive parameters to detect entry into estrus. The data were subjected to normality tests, followed by appropriate statistical analyses of each variable. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the percentage of animals in estrus (95.00 ± 11.18%), interval between sponge removal and beginning of estrus (49.72 ± 8.93 h), interval between sponge removal and end of estrus (76.84 ± 11.98 h), duration of estrus (27.08 ± 8.68 h), size of the largest follicle (6.82 ± 0.44 mm), interval between sponge removal and ovulation (78.28 ± 10.82 h), time from ovarian onset to estrus (28.52 ± 5.44 h), follicular growth rate (0.86 ± 0.29 mm/day), number of ovulations (1.32 ± 0.23), plasma progesterone concentration at 7 days after ovulation (10.28 ± 1.65 ng.mL-1), and gestation rate at 30 days after the beginning of estrus (75 ± 12.5%). However, the cost of the synchronization protocol per animal was 43.42% lower in treatments 4 and 5 (30% of the doses) than in treatment 1 (100% of the dose). Ovulation and estrus were efficiently synchronized with the use of 39.75 ?g of sodium cloprostenol and 90 UI of eCG, applied at the Bai Hui acupoint or at a false acupoint.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33904/25454,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Clinical and hematological prognostic factors in dogs with parvoviral enteritis and sepsis,"Parvoviral enteritis is a common viral infection in dogs and is associated with many clinical and hematological changes. Bacterial translocation is a common complication and may result in sepsis. The objective of this study is to determine the presence of clinical and hematological factors associated with the risk of death in puppies with naturally occurring parvoviral enteritis and sepsis. Twenty-four dogs with parvoviral enteritis confirmed by chromatographic immunoassay during the clinical routine of a university veterinary hospital were selected. At admission and every 24 hours until the third day of hospitalization or until death, venous blood samples were collected for complete blood count, renal and hepatic biochemistry, and lactate and magnesium measurement; arterial blood samples were collected for gas analysis. Sodium, potassium, and ionized calcium were also analyzed, and a complete physical examination was performed. The factors associated with mortality were evaluated by Cox univariate analysis at a level of significance of 5%. The increase in urea and heart rate was associated with an increase in the risk of death. In contrast, an increase in total leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, partial pressure of oxygen, base deficit, bicarbonate ion, and oxygen saturation were associated with a reduction in the risk of death.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33744/25498,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Influence of the microbiological quality of raw milk on the shelf life of pasteurized milk,"The dairy industry strives to produce high quality products with high nutritional value as well as to meet the legal standards for longer shelf life. However, these goals are made unfeasible by the poor quality of raw milk produced in some regions of Brazil. Others Brazilian dairy regions, however, already succeed in producing milk with low microbial counts, such as the municipality of Castro, Paraná state, designated as the ‘Brazilian dairy capital’. In order to evaluate the effect of raw milk quality on microbial counts during the shelf life of pasteurized milk, samples were collected from two dairy regions of Paraná: the northern and Castro region, characterized by milk production with high and low microbiological counts, respectively. Samples were experimentally pasteurized and the total microorganism counts were analyzed for 18 days at 7°C, using the Brazilian standard microbiological count limit for pasteurized milk (8 x 104 CFU/mL) as the end of the shelf life. Low microbiological counts in raw milk (Castro) resulted in significantly lower counts shortly after pasteurization and over the entire shelf life, meeting the pasteurized milk standard for 18 days. The temporal evolution in the counts over 18 days for the milks of high and low microbiological count was similar; however, the disparity between the absolute counts between the regions was significant (p < 0.05). Of the milk samples from northern Paraná, four (44.4%) already had counts higher than that of the legislative limit for pasteurized milk immediately after pasteurization. The others (five) reached the maximum microbiological count limit for pasteurized milk on the 6th day after pasteurization. In contrast, the milk from the Castro region remained below the limit throughout the analysis period. Thus, it can be stated that the microbiological quality of raw milk is directly related to the initial count of microorganisms after pasteurization, and that pasteurized milk produced from raw milk with low microbiological counts complies with the Brazilian legislation for 18 days following thermal processing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32903/25450,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Amh Polymorphisms and their association with traits indicative of sexual precocity in nelore heifers,"Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) is a protein expressed in the gonads and related to ovarian follicular development. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of polymorphisms in the AMH gene in a Nelore herd to analyze the genetic constitution of this population and to perform association studies with early pregnancy occurrence (EPO) and age at first calving (AFC). Phenotypic data consisted of verification of early pregnancy and age at first calving of 197 unrelated heifers exposed to the mating season and aged between 15 and 17 months (precocious group) and 24 months (non-precocious group). The ""precocious"" group consisted of 67 heifers with age at first calving of 26.5 ± 0.59 months, and the ""non-precocious"" group was composed of 130 heifers with age at first calving of 36.4 ± 0.99 months. All five exons of the AMH gene were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequenced. A total of three SNPs were identified in this study, all of them located in exon 5 (rs527023314, rs722016629, and rs134387246), the latter one positioned in the stop codon. All three SNPs identified in exon 5 characterized synonymous mutations. Only SNP rs134387246 exhibited a significant value (P ? 0.10) for EPO and AFC. The association study of SNP rs134387246 revealed an over-dominance effect (P = 0.056), and no additive effect was observed (P = 0.67). A reduction of 2.5 months (75 days) in the age at first calving of heterozygous heifers for the SNP rs134387246 was observed. For the first time, polymorphisms of the AMH gene were described in Nelore heifers and associated with sexual precocity traits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33767/25453,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Maize-crotalaria intercropping systems,"The objective of this study was to identify a maize-crotalaria intercropping system feasible for producing straw while maintaining maize yield. A study with a completely randomized block design was performed in 2015 and 2016, with 7 × 2 + 1 split plot and three replications in a clayey Red Oxisol. Seven intercropping systems were allocated to each plot, and two crotalaria species (Crotalaria spectabilis and C. ochroleuca) cultivated with maize in monoculture were allocated to each subplot. Crotalaria yield, total chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, plant height, plant dry matter, thousand grain mass, and corn grain yield were evaluated. C. spectabilis was more sensitive to water level variations during the crop cycle than C. ochroleuca. Crotalaria sown before maize planting with maize seeds incorporated in the soil presented a relatively higher phytomass but decreased corn grain yield. The management system in which crotalaria was sown in the inter-row with a ridge planter at the time of maize planting and the system in which crotalaria was sown in the maize sowing furrow were feasible for straw production because they did not decrease corn grain yield and did not affect maize harvesting operations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33278/25449,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Hydrogen peroxide on acclimation of soursop seedlings under irrigation water salinity,"The Brazilian Northeast region provides favorable conditions for the exploitation of several crops, but the high salt concentration in irrigation water constitutes a limiting factor for production in most cases. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence, growth and partition of photoassimilates in soursop seedlings, cv. ‘Morada Nova’, subjected to irrigation with water of increasing salinity levels and to exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide. The study was carried out in plastic bags under greenhouse conditions, using a sandy loam Regolithic Neosol, in the municipality of Campina Grande, PB, Brazil. Treatments were distributed in randomized blocks, in a 5 x 5 factorial arrangement, relative to five levels of irrigation water electrical conductivity - ECw (0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8 and 3.5 dS m-1) and five concentrations of hydrogen peroxide - H2O2 (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM), with four replicates and three plants per plot. Increasing salt concentration compromised all variables analyzed and leaf area was most sensitive. As irrigation water electrical conductivity increased, the deleterious effects of water salinity on the emergence percentage, emergence speed index, stem diameter and leaf area were attenuated by the exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide, with highest efficiency at the concentration of 50 µM. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations above 38 µM inhibited the specific leaf area of soursop, cv. ‘Morada Nova’.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33206/25448,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Type and quantity of biochar influenced soil microbial activity and carbon priming effect,"Biochar has shown much potential to be used as soil amendment and conditioner as well as an effective alternative to waste disposal. However, the effect of biochar on soil organic matter varies according to the type of feedstock. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different types and rates of application of biochar on soil microbial activity and on soil carbon priming effect. The incubation experiment was set up as a completely randomized design in a 2 x 5 factorial scheme, with two types of biochar (coconut husk and orange bagasse) and five rates of application (0, 5, 10, 15 and 30 t ha-1), with three replications. Soil microbial activity was evaluated through the concentration of CO2 released from the soil during a period of 130 days. Carbon priming effect was determined based on the CO2 respired in the biochar treated soil and in the control soil. Both biochars increased the total oxidizable carbon in the soil when they were applied at 30 t ha-1, however, the orange bagasse biochar was more effective than the coconut biochar. Coconut biochar increased the cumulative soil microbial respiration at all rates of application during the incubation period, therefore, it contributed to a positive carbon priming effect and should be applied with caution to avoid excessive loss of carbon from the soil. Orange bagasse biochar had little influence on the cumulative CO2 emission, except at 15 t ha-1, which increased soil microbial activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30912/25445,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Pathogenicity and virulence of entomopathogenic nematodes against Dichelops melacanthus Dallas (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae),"Infestations of Dichelops melacanthus (Dallas; Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in corn and wheat in Brazil, and the subsequent damage, have increased in recent years, mainly owing to this insect’s ability to survive the off-season. The control of this insect is mainly carried out with chemical insecticides, but the development of alternative methods, such as biological control, can contribute to a more sustainable management. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) for the control of D. melacanthus. A selection test was performed with 15 isolates of genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis regarding their pathogenicity and virulence on adults of D. melacanthus. Concentration (10, 20, 40, 50, and 100 infective juveniles (IJs)/cm2) and greenhouse tests were carried out only with the Steinernema feltiae isolate (IBCB-n 47). All experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design. The selection test data were submitted to the Scott-Knott averages test (P ? 0.05), and those from the greenhouse test to the Student's t-test. The results of the concentration assay were subjected to regression analysis. All isolates showed pathogenicity and virulence in adults of D. melacanthus. The isolates GL (Heterorhabditis amazonensis), IBCB-n27 (Steinernema sp.), and RSC05 (H. amazonensis) were the most virulent (80.0, 82.0, and 88.0% mortality, respectively). The higher concentrations of S. feltiae (50 and 100 IJs/cm²) were responsible for the highest mortality rates of green belly stink bug (88.0 and 86.0%, respectively). In the greenhouse test, S. feltiae caused higher mortality (38%) than the control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32760/25446,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the initial shoot development and root architecture of citrus cultivars used as rootstocks. Seeds from five rootstocks, ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin, ‘Rangpur’ lime, ‘Rough’ lemon, ‘C13’ and ‘Troyer’ citranges, were sown in black polyethylene bags. A completely randomized block design with five replications and one plant per plot was applied. At 30 and 45 days after emergence, shoots and roots were collected for analysis. Shoot analysis measured the total number of leaves, leaf area, stem diameter, plant height, and fresh and dry matter weights. Root analysis evaluated fresh and dry matter weights and root architecture by image analysis, which recorded root traits including primary, secondary, and tertiary root numbers; length and total volume; and the percentage of secondary roots present in the upper third of the primary root. Shoot and root data of fresh and dry weights were submitted to variance analysis and compared using Tukey’s test (5%). The remaining root data were standardized for variance 1 and studied through principal component analysis. The ‘C13’ citrange showed good shoot development, with greater leaf area, plant height, stem diameter, and shoot fresh and dry matter weights during both evaluation periods, followed by the ‘Troyer’ citrange. The ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin had the smallest shoot and root development during both evaluation periods, presenting lower primary root, secondary root, and root volume than other cultivars evaluated at the same time. The ‘Troyer’ citrange had fewer roots in the upper third of the primary root and a higher root insertion angle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/30111/25444,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Selectivity of pesticides used in peach orchards to eggs and pupae of the predators Chrysoperla externa and Coleomegilla quadrifasciata,"This study aimed to assess, under laboratory conditions, the selectivity of nine pesticides used in peach to the egg and pupal stages of the predators Chrysoperla externa and Coleomegilla quadrifasciata. Tests consisted of the direct application of pesticides on eggs and pupae of predators and assessment of sublethal effects on fertility and fecundity of emerged adults. For eggs, the pesticides were classified according to the effects on the reduction of the percentage of larval hatching, while for pupae they were classified as a function of the total effect, according to the toxicity scale proposed by the International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control (IOBC). All the pesticides (used dose) were harmless (class 1) to eggs of C. externa, but abamectin (80) and copper + calcium (1%) were considered slightly harmful (class 2) to pupae. In bioassays with C. quadrifasciata, abamectin (80), deltamethrin (40), and malathion (150) were classified as slightly harmful (class 2), while fenitrothion (100) was moderately harmful (class 3) to predator eggs; in the pupal stage, abamectin (80), fenitrothion (100), and malathion (150) were considered harmful (class 4). Azadirachtin (1%), chlorantraniliprole (14), deltamethrin (40), copper + calcium (25% + 10%), and sulfur + calcium (3.5 Ba) were harmless (class 1) to eggs and pupae of C. externa and C. quadrifasciata and thus should be prioritized in sprayings for pest control in the IPM of peach.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32896/25447,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Short-term evaluation of Massai grass forage yield and agronomic characteristics and sheep performance under rotational grazing with different pre-grazing canopy heights,"This study aimed to evaluate the morphogenic, structural, chemical characteristics, and forage yield of Massai grass, as well as the performance of sheep under three pre-grazing canopy heights. Eighteen Dorper x crossbred sheep (12 males and 6 females) were subjected to three pre-grazing canopy heights of Massai grass (45, 35, and 25 cm). Rotational grazing was adopted, with a fixed rest period of 12 days and occupation of four days. Before placing animals in the paddock, stocking rate was estimated to ensure a reduction of about 50% in the initial height. Morphogenic and chemical characteristics of forage were evaluated, as well as animal intake and performance. Pasture managed at 25 cm height induced reductions in stem and sheath sizes, and phyllochron but an increased leaf: stem ratio. However, the pasture cut at 35 cm above ground promoted an increase in total dry mass and foliar leaf productions, in addition to greater forage availability and daily accumulation. Yet, pastures with a height of 45 cm had a higher percentage of stem and senescent material, decreasing leaf intake by animals. Among the studied heights, 35 cm is the most suitable for Massai grass, when used for rearing sheep for meat production under pasture conditions in the northern Tocantins. This is because this management provided a greater availability of good quality forage and thereby increasing weight gains per area in animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34060/25431,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Production of annual ryegrass with different doses of nitrogen fertilization in topdressing,"The objective of this study was to assess the growth of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) cv. BRS Ponteio with different doses of nitrogen applied in the pasture, thereby adjusting their growth to the exponential growth model. A randomized block design was used with five nitrogen application rates (0, 150, 250, 350, and 450 kg N ha-1) and four replicates, applied in installments. Each plot measured 9 m2. On April 15, 2014, 25 kg ha-1 of viable pure seeds of annual ryegrass were sown at a depth of 0.02 m, in 18 rows spaced at 0.17 m in each plot. Growth in the control treatment (zero nitrogen) pasture lasted 167 days with only three cuts, whereas in pastures treated with 350 and 450 kg N ha-1, growth was extended for an additional 45 days with a 333% increase in the number of cuts. The pastures were used for the same duration (188 days) in the treatments with 150 and 250 kg N ha-1, however, increased nitrogen resulted in two additional cuts and a shorter time interval between cuts. The time interval between each cut and the degree-days interacted dynamically causing distinct growth. Growth of the annual ryegrass BRS Ponteio without nitrogen application is poor and cannot be represented even by a first order linear model. The application of nitrogen topdressing, in the form of urea, decreases the time interval between cuts, increases the dry matter production per hectare, stimulates this production, and follows the exponential growth model.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34036/25430,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Effects of water deficit and pH on seed germination and seedling development in Cereus jamacaru,"The lack of water and soil acidity are current problems occurring in many regions around the globe. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the effects of seed germination and seedling development, in order to determine the species adaptability to the ever-changing environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of water deficit and pH on seed germination and seedling development in Cereus jamacaru. A completely randomized experiment was performed. A factorial scheme of 6 × 7, corresponding to six osmotic potential values (0.0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, and -1.0 MPa) induced by PEG 6000, and seven pH levels (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) with four replications was used. The variables analyzed were germination (G), germination speed index (GSI), mean germination time (MGT), normal seedling (NS), root length (RL), shoot length (ShL), seedling length (SL), and seedling dry mass (SDM). The statistical analysis included ANOVA and binomial models (G and NS), regression models with quadratic terms (GSI and MGT), and response surface method (ShL and SL) for the variables with at least one significant factor (p < 0.05). C. jamacaru showed susceptibility to water deficit at seed germination and seedling development stages, indicated by the decreases in G, GSI, NS, ShL, and SL at osmotic potential below to 0.0 MPa. The pH interaction with osmotic potential affected C. jamacaru seedling development. The increase in pH was favorable for seedling development, but not for seed germination.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29443/25443,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Environmental effects on pre-weaning traits in Santa Gertrudis cattle,"We aimed to evaluate environmental effects on pre-weaning traits of Santa Gertrudis cattle. We used 213 standardized records for adjusted 205-day weight at weaning (W205), average daily gain from birth to weaning (AGD), and number of days to gain 160 kg from birth to weaning (D160), obtained from the Santa Gertrudis Breeders' Association for animals born between 1990 and 1997. The files were edited with information regarding cow age at calving (CAC) and contemporary group (CG), for which the effects of year and season of birth, animal category, herd, and sex were considered. It was observed that cow age at calving, which had linear and quadratic effects, and effect of contemporary group were significant (P < 0.0001) for the evaluated traits. Estimated averages were 198.05 ± 40.64 kg, 0.790 ± 0.198 kg day-1, and 288.05 ± 67.18 days for W205, ADG, and D160, respectively. Males were 4.67 kg heavier (197.17 kg) than females, on average. Regarding the animal category effect, the classified females were 2.3% heavier than the unclassified, on average. On average, animals born in the dry season were 1.6% lighter than those born in the rainy season (197.18 kg). Thus, environmental effects are important and should be considered in any analysis model.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33806/25427,E-ISSN 1679-0359

We also aimed to evaluate the SDP digestibility for dogs. We used 36 dogs distributed in 3 experiments. In the digestibility assay (Experiment 1), eight adult Beagles were distributed according to a double Latin square design (4 x 4). The following diets were evaluated: 0, 4, 8, and 12% SDP of diet. In the palatability trial (Experiment 2), 20 adult dogs were used. Diets containing 0 and 4% SDP were pair-wised compared. Blood parameters (Experiment 3) were evaluated in eight adult Beagles. Dogs were fed the diet with 0% for 10 days and then the diet with 12% SDP for further 10 days. Dietary SDP inclusion promoted a linear increase (P0.05). In conclusion, SDP shows high digestibility of CP and DM, being feasible its use in diets for dogs. However, it is important to study the effects of inclusion levels lower than 4%, in order to do not compromise diet palatability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33712/25426,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Can silicon (Si) fertilization influence the production and nutritional value of Urochloa Convert HD364?,"Tropical soils are highly weathered, acidic, and low in silicon (Si) availability for plants. Si has been considered an essential nutrient for many grasses. Urochloa Convert HD364 is classified as a forage plant that accumulates Si, but the accumulation of this nutrient in the leaf can influence qualitative characteristics, fiber quality, plant architecture, and development of forage. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the production and nutritive value of Urochloa hybrid cultivar Convert HD364 (CIAT 36087) grown from soils collected in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using 8-L plastic pots and three types of soil. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in a 3 × 5 factorial: three soils [Rhodic Acrudox (Ox1), Rhodic Hapludox (Ox2) and Arenic Hapludult (Ult)] and five silicate rates (0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 Mg ha-1 of calcium/magnesium silicate), with four replications. Application of CaSiO3 to the soil increases the concentration of Si in the leaves of Urochloa Convert HD364. The dry matter, crude protein and mineral matter, fiber quality, and digestibility of Urochloa were not influenced by the increase in Si levels in the leaves until 45 days after seeding. Forty-five days after planting, CaSiO3 did not interfere with the growth characteristics and production of Urochloa Convert HD364. There is no evidence that the increased Si levels in the leaf affected the production and nutritive value, especially fiber quality of Urochloa Convert HD364 until 45 days after sedding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33881/25429,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Productivity, profitability and nutritional quality of forage and silage of winter cereals","This study aimed to evaluate the production, the physical and nutritional composition of forage and silage, as well as the profitability and aerobic stability of different winter cereals harvested at the stage of floury grain. The experimental design was a 2x7 factorial randomized block design, with two forms of foods (fresh forage and silage) and seven genotypes, with four replications. The genotypes used were the white oat (Avena sativa) cv. URS Taura; barley (Hordeum vulgare) cv. BRS Brau and cv. BRS Cauê; wheat (Tricticum aestivum) cv. CD 1440; rye (Secale cereal) cv. BR 01; and triticale (X Triticosecale) cv. IPR 111 and cv. BRS Saturno. The materials were harvested during the stage of floury grain. In forage evaluation, rye showed the highest (P < 0,05) dry biomass production (7,100 kg ha-1), but with a higher percentage of stem (46.7%) in dry matter, implying higher ADF (44.69%) in relation to other cereals. The forage of the white oats cv. URS Taura and triticale cv. IPR 111 provided the best nutritional quality compared to the other evaluated cereals, but in the resulting silage, only triticale remained with forage-like characteristics. It was clear the superiority of barley cv. BRS Cauê, wheat cv. CD 1440 and rye cv. BR 01 regarding the maintenance of aerobic stability (160 hours), while the other silages lost their stability within 32 hours. Rye cv. BR 01 and triticale IPR 111 presented the highest production of recovered dry biomass (5,402 and 5,352 kg ha-1 respectively), barley cv. BRS Cauê and oat URS Taura provided higher cost of production per kg-1 dry biomass, both with R$ 0.29 and higher cost per kg of recovered dry biomass R$ 0.45 and 0.37 respectively. There are several factors to consider when choosing the winter species for silage production, and future studies can fully elucidate these factors.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33674/25425,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Probability of beef tenderness in confined cows - a meta-analytic approach,"This study aimed to assess the probability of meat tenderness in confined cows. For this purpose, CAPES and SciELO platforms were searched for papers under this subject published in Brazil between 2000 and 2015. A total of 43 articles were found, of which eleven were used. Those selected approached the finishing of confined cows and specified animal genetic group, breed, and age at experiment start. Moreover, all these studies evaluated sensory and organoleptic characteristics of meat, following the same method. Each variable was analyzed by logistic regression, using the LOGISTIC procedure of SAS. The factors were evaluated by odds ratio (OR), in which changes in the probability of meat tenderness were estimated by means of an add-on function in regression variable units. Animal age at the beginning of termination, percentages of zebuine blood and heterozygosity, and marbling score are factors that affect (p < 0.30) the chance of beef tenderness. The probabilities of obtaining a tender meat increase when age at termination beginning and zebuine genotype participation are reduced, as well as when heterozygosity (via crosses) and meat marbling score increases.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33863/25428,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Evaluation of sulfur source and dose on the nutritional state and production of piatã forage,"Sulfur deficiency in soils has become a worldwide concern for agricultural production. This study aimed to evaluate the concequence of variable sulfur source and dosing on the nutritional status and production of Piatã forage in a dystrophic Ultisol. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design with four replications. The 4 x 5 factorial treatments consisted of four sulfur sources (elemental sulfur pastilles [ESPA], gypsum [GY], gypsite [GI], and elemental sulfur powder [ESPO]) and five sulfur doses (0, 50, 100, 150. and 200 mg kg-1). The sulfur applications resulted in similar maximum shoot dry mass (SDM) production (16.66 to 17.69 g pot-1) with all sources. However, Piatã grass achieved maximum production in the treatments with 112 mg kg-1 of GI, 118 mg kg-1 of GY and ESPA, and 146 mg kg-1 of ESPO. The number of tillers, the leaf:stem ratio, and SPAD increased with increasing sulfur dose. The greatest increments of root dry mass (RDM) and of the tiller number were obtained with the ESPO source. Macronutrient concentrations in shoot dry mass tissue were in the order K > N > Ca > P > S > Mg. Low sulfur supply resulted in decreased Piatã grass growth with all sulfur sources tested. Differential responses were found with applications of different sulfur sources for SDM, RDM, and tillers number. The sources did not alter the leaf:stem ratio or SPAD index.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33476/25422,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Characteristics of the non-carcass components of steers fed different sources of dietary carbohydrates,"We evaluated the characteristics of the non-carcass components of 24 steers (Charolais × Nelore) fed different carbohydrate sources (ground corn, soybean hulls, or wheat bran) in the diet. The animals were 353.2 kg and 22 months of age at early termination, and had been fed forage consisting of sorghum silage at a forage:concentrate ratio of 40.2:59.8. The carbohydrate sources had no effect on the weights of the carcass, vital organs, and blood. The absolute weights of the intestines and rumen fat were higher (P < 0.05) in animals fed corn than in those fed soybean hulls or wheat bran (10.87 vs. 8.89 and 8.87 kg and 5.26 vs. 4.12 and 3.64 kg, respectively). The same pattern was observed when these organs weights were adjusted for empty body weight. The weight of the omasum was highest (P < 0.05) in the wheat bran-fed animals (6.02 vs. 4.70 and 5.49 kg in the corn- and soybean hull-fed animals, respectively). Animals fed soybean hulls had a higher absolute weight of kidney fat (1.6 kg) than steers receiving wheat bran (1.06 kg) or corn (0.79 kg). Wheat bran gave the highest leg weight compared with corn and soybean hulls (2.46 vs. 2.22 and 2.23 kg per 100 kg of empty body weight, respectively).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33638/25423,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Fermentation times and feed additives improve the quality of olive bagasse silage,"This research aimed to measure the microbiological, chemical composition profile and fermentative characteristics during storage of fresh olive bagasse, in natura and incorporated with corn, soybean and rice brans, respectively. The experimental design was completely randomized, with the plots constituting the four main treatments (olive bagasse in natura or with added corn, soybean and rice brans, respectively), and the subplots allocated the three sampling times, which corresponded to time zero (at the ensilage moment) and 28 and 56 days of ensilage. The fermentative characteristics (dry matter content [DM], pH and ammoniacal nitrogen [NH3-N], microbiological profile (populations of filamentous fungi, lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria and Clostridia) and chemical composition profile (mineral matter, organic matter, crude protein [CP], ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) were determined. The corn grain and rice meal treatments, which demonstrated pH 4.08 and 3.96 at 28 days of fermentation, respectively, provided the best fermentation profile. After storage for 56 days, the samples with added soybean and rice meal reached the highest levels of CP (166.15 and 93.78 g kg-1 DM), respectively. Increasing the storage period reduced the pH of the obtained silages but increased the losses of DM, NH3-N and contributed to the losses of some nutrients. Rice meal and corn grain have been recommended to be used as additives in olive bagasse storage. However, the choice of additives studied is dependent on their commercial availability in each region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33669/25424,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Addition of different probiotics to commercial feeds for piglets during the nursery phase,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the addition of different probiotics to commercial diets for piglets on diet digestibility, total bacterial count (TBC) of faeces, Clostridium count and growth performance. In the digestibility assay, 24 entire male pigs with an average initial body weight of 18.8 ± 0.87 kg were housed individually in metabolism cages and distributed in a completely randomised experimental design; this consisted of three treatments (probiotic-free commercial feed; commercial feed with the addition of 0.2% probiotic containing a blend of microorganisms; commercial feed with the addition of 0.1% yeast-based probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii) and eight replicates. The digestibility of the feeds was determined. At the end of the experiment, 25 grams of faeces were collected for microbiological analysis. In the subsequent experiment, 150 crossbred piglets (entire males and females), weaned at 21 days of age and having an average initial body weight of 6.81 ± 0.71 kg were distributed in a randomised complete block design, with six treatments repeated twice in the first and thrice in the second block, totaling five replicates and five pigs per experimental unit. The treatments, arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement, consisted of a combination of the three experimental diets used in the digestibility test and two genders. The growth performance in the nursery was evaluated during the following phases: pre-starter I (21 to 29 days), pre-starter I and II (21 to 40 days) and the total period (21 to 63 days). There was an effect (p < 0.05) of the diets on the digestible protein and the logarithm of the TBC. There was no effect (p > 0.05) of the interaction or the diets on the growth performance of the pigs in any of the phases. Both in the entire experimental period and in the pre-starter I and II phases, male pigs presented better feed conversion (p < 0.05) than females. There was an improvement in the apparent digestibility of the crude protein of the feed when the pigs were fed commercial feed containing probiotics. Pigs fed commercial feed containing probiotics based on yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii presented a reduced TBC in their faeces. Commercial feed containing probiotics did not influence the growth performance parameters of nursery phase piglets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33416/25421,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Non-carcass component yield of lambs finished in distinct production systems,"Abstract: The aim was to assess the effect of the production system on the yield of non-carcass components of Dorper x Santa Inês crossbred lambs. The study was carried out at the teaching and research unit of sheep and goats of the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Campus Dois Vizinhos - PR using 24 uncastrated Dorper x Santa Inês crossbreed lambs (8 animals per treatment). The experimental design was completely randomized using three treatments with eight replicates. The treatments were: Panicum maximum cv. Aruana pasture, no shade, and no concentrate supplementation (PAss); Panicum maximum cv. Aruana pasture in the shade of Louro-Pardo Nativo trees (Cordia trichotoma) and with concentrate supplementation (PAcs); feedlot pens (COp). Carcass weight did not differ between treatments (p > 0.05). However, sheep in feedlot pens showed higher average daily weight gain. The non-carcass components differed significantly (p < 0.05), apart from the empty gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and reproductive organs. Blood and external body components (head, skin, and limbs) showed higher weight in COp animals. The full gastrointestinal tract showed a significant difference between the treatments with the highest weight in sheep in the two pasture systems. Blood yield and weight of liver, kidneys, spleen, and heart were higher in COp animals. The production systems thus affected the total mass of non-carcass components in Dorper x Santa Inês crossbred lambs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33270/25420,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Agronomic and productive characteristics of maize and Paiaguas palisadegrass in integrated production systems,"Currently, mixed systems for growing annual crops with forage plants of the Brachiaria genus represent an excellent alternative for the cultivation of maize by using the area for agricultural and livestock farming, which provides higher income to the grower and sustainability to the agricultural systems of the Cerrado. However, little is known about the best means for sowing such intercropped plants. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of maize (Zea mays) as well as the productive and nutritional characteristics of Paiaguas palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS Paiaguas) as the second crop in integrated production systems. The experimental design used randomized blocks with four replications. The treatments consisted of the following forage systems: monocropped of maize, monocropped of Paiaguas palisadegrass, maize intercropped with Paiaguas palisadegrass in rows, maize intercropped with Paiaguas palisadegrass between rows, and maize with oversown Paiaguas palisadegrass. The results showed that intercropping of maize with Paiaguas palisadegrass does not interfere with the agronomic characteristics or grain yield of maize, regardless of the system that was adopted. Regarding the production of forage, low production of dry matter was found for Paiaguas palisadegrass oversown in maize, though the nutritional value was better. Intercropping maze and Paiaguas palisadegrass is relevant to integrated production systems, as it allows for of a third harvest in the same crop year, which maintains sustainability especially because a smaller arable area is used compared to conventional systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32198/25418,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Profitability analysis of compost barn and free stall milk-production systems: a comparison.,"The objective of this study was to comparatively analyse the profitability of compost barn and free stall milk-production systems as a means of helping producers and technicians choose the type of facility most suitable for each farm. Data collected from four farms from January to December 2016 were analysed; the data were distributed equally among compost barn and free stall systems. The cost of milk production was estimated according to the operating cost methodology and considering the milk production cost centre, which involved both lactating and dry cows. Additionally, gross and net margins were estimated as indicators of profitability. The results showed that the average gross and net margins were not influenced by the type of facility; they were positive in both of the production systems analysed. Among the components of the net operating cost, the proportion of the ""medications"" item was lower in the compost barn properties, while the cost of bedding for the cows was lower in the free stall farms. Depreciation and total operating cost were similar in the two systems. Milk sales made up a higher percentage of the revenue in the free stall farms, despite the high standard deviation, while the expectations of revenues from wastes were similar in the two production systems. Given that there were no significant economic differences between the types of facility, it is concluded that ease in management, productivity, reproductive performance, animal health (hoof injuries and mastitis), environmental issues, and availability of water and bedding material should be the motivators for choosing one system over the other.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33757/25417,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Seroconversion attributable to vaccination of heifers with the strain B-19 of Brucella abortus,"Bovine brucellosis is transmitted by Brucella abortus and causes considerable economic losses to agribusiness. To determine the seroconversion rate attributable to vaccination of heifers with B. abortus strain B-19, 330 blood serum samples from 110 heifers aged three to eight months from five properties in the municipality of Araguaína, Tocantins, Brazil, were analyzed. On day zero (D-0), blood samples were collected, and 55 heifers from the intervention group were vaccinated. The remaining blood samples were collected on days seven (D-7), 14 (D-14), and 21 (D-21). The serum samples were analyzed using the buffered acidified plate antigen (BAPA) test. The rate of seroconversion attributable to vaccination was calculated by subtracting from the seroconversion incidence rate in the intervention group the incidence rate of the control group. On D-0, 100% (110/110) of the heifers were negative in the BAPA test (95% CI [96.70 - 100%], p < 0.05). On D-7, the seroconversion rate was 94.55% (52/55) (95% CI [84.88 - 98.84%], p < 0.05) in the intervention group and 0% (0/55) (95% CI [0.00 - 6.49%], p < 0.05) in the control group. On D-14, the rate was 98.18% (54/55) (95% CI [90.28 - 99.95%], p < 0.05) in the intervention group and 0% in the control group. Therefore, seroconversion attributable to vaccination varied from 78.39% (84.88 - 6.49%) to 92.35% (98.86 - 6.49%) on D-7 and from 83.79% (90.28 - 6.49%) to 93.46% (99.95 - 6.49%) on D-14, respectively. On D-21, the seroconversion rate in the 55 heifers from the control group vaccinated on D-14 was 100% (55/55) (95% CI [93.51 - 100%], p < 0.05) but was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that of heifers from the intervention group vaccinated on D-7. The results of this study allow making recommendations to the Official Veterinary Service on establishing a vaccination audit, with random collection of blood samples starting on day seven after vaccination in heifers considered vaccinated with B. abortus strain B-19 using the BAPA test as a diagnostic test and considering a minimum seroconversion rate of 75% to evaluate vaccination against brucellosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32801/25415,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,"Evaluation of the chemical, physical and nutritional composition and sensory acceptability of different sweet potato cultivars","The aim of the study was to evaluate the chemical, physical and nutritional composition and sensory acceptability of different sweet potato cultivars to classify the best genotypes for human consumption. We evaluated ten genotypes extracted from the Germplasm bank of Midwest State University, Brazil. The cultivars were evaluated regarding their sensory acceptability and chemical (reducing sugar; nonreducing sugar; total sugar; pH; total soluble solids; titratable acidity; total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio; and instrumental colour) and nutritional composition (moisture; ash; protein; lipid; carbohydrate; energy value; total carotenoid; and ascorbic acid). Greater scores (p < 0.05) for overall acceptance were obtained for the white pulp genotypes Amorano, Júlia, UGA 45, and UGA 49. There was a statistical difference (p < 0.05) in the chemical and nutritional composition of sweet potatoes, except for the pH values. Generally, tuber have a light colour (values of L* greater than 50) with a yellow shade (b*) and green subshade (negative a* values). The exception was noticed in the UGA 34 genotype, which presented a higher red shade (positive a* value) and a yellow subshade. The cultivars more indicated for human consumption were the UGA 34 (favorable nutritional profile), UGA 45 (better acceptability and favorable chemical and nutritional composition), and Amorano (better acceptability and favorable chemical composition). On the other hand, the UGA 29 genotype may be characterized as the less appropriated for consumption. That, due to its less acceptance from the consumers and an inferior chemical and nutritional characterization. We conclude that the Brazilian sweet potato cultivars more indicated for human consumption are the UGA 34, UGA 45 and Amorano, considering that present more favorable chemical, nutritional and sensory acceptability characteristics. The UGA 29 genotype may be characterized as less recommended for consumption.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/34227/25413,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Comparison of water consumption estimates for tropical and winter forages by FDR probes and weighing lysimeters,"Soil moisture determination is essential for a good use of available water resources. In this regard, the use of frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) probes has as advantages mobility and practicality in relation to lysimeters. The experiment was carried out between April and June 2016 at the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ/USP), located in Piracicaba, SP at the geographical coordinates 22°42?14.6? S and 47°37?24.1? W and altitude of 546 m. This study aimed to assess these FDR probes to estimate water consumption in comparison to measurements by weighing lysimeters (ETcLys) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in Mombaça and Bermuda grass pastures under single cultivation and overseeded with oat and ryegrass. Soil moisture was assessed daily by FDR probes by estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETcFDR probe) from soil water balance calculation, which was correlated with ETcLys and ETo (Penman-Monteith, FAO 56). For all treatments, FDR probes presented the highest water consumptions when compared to the other two evapotranspiration methods, with accumulations of 126.5 and 125.6 mm for single and overseeded Mombaça grass, respectively. For Bermuda grass, water consumption was 123.4 mm in the single cultivation and 128.5 mm when overseeded. The method of estimating evapotranspiration by FDR probes showed good correlations with ETo and ETcLys.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33445/25412,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Substrates with organic residues in Fritillaria cirrhosa seedlings for bulbus production,"China is abundant in organic residues from agricultural and forestry efforts. Bulbus Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don (BFC) is a precious wild herb of Liliaceae that grows in the Tibetan area of China and the bulbs are used as a source of medicine. The shortage of germplasm resources restricts the development of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, so improved cultivation methods are urgently needed. The objective of this study was to study the effects of different substrates on the growth of F. cirrhosa seedlings. Sawdust and vermi-compost are common organic residues and were selected as nursery materials to supplement efforts to cultivate Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don from ripe seeds and bulbs. The experiments were conducted in a plastic greenhouse in Ya’an of Sichuan Province from January to May 2013. Vegetative parameters of leaf length, leaf width, seedling fresh weight, seedling dry weight, and bulb size and fresh weight were measured. Additionally, the emergence ratio and preservation rate were calculated. The following results were obtained: (1) Sowing seeds of F. cirrhosa with 70% vermi-compost and 30% sawdust gave the best emergence rate, leaf length (60 days after seedling emergence, 60 DAS), and bulb dry weight (at harvest, 93 DAS). (2) The leaf nitrogen content (60 DAS) was positively correlated with the nitrogen content of bulbs (at harvest, 93 DAS). From the data, we concluded that forestry residues such as sawdust and vermi-compost can serve as excellent growing substrates of BFC seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32936/25409,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Yield and quality of lettuce cultivars irrigated with treated domestic sewage effluent,"Given the scarcity of water resources in semi-arid regions and the potential of water reuse as a strategy to solve this problem, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of domestic sewage effluent on growth, yield, and quality of two crisp lettuce cultivars. The research was carried out in greenhouse conditions utilizing an experimental design with randomized blocks in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, with five concentrations from treated domestic effluent blended with tap water (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of treated domestic effluent) and two crisp loose lettuce cultivars (Scarlet and Cristal) done in triplicate with five plants per trial. The lettuce plants were growth in trapezoid-shaped PVC channels filled with coconut fiber substrate and organic compost (2:1) for 35 days after transplanting. The experimental results indicated that irrigation with 30% sewage effluent diluted in tap water gives higher growth and yield of lettuce. The Cristal cultivar shows growth, soluble solids, and chlorophyll higher than the Scarlet cultivar. The application of treated domestic effluent does not affect the post-harvest quality of the lettuce to both cultivars.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/33095/25410,E-ISSN 1679-0359

40,2019,Budburst and flowering intensity by the spraying of dormancy-breaking products in ‘Eva’ apple trees,"Spraying of dormancy-breaking chemicals is a mandatory procedure to produce temperate fruits in low-chill regions. Although hydrogen cyanamide (HC) + mineral oil (MO) show efficiency enhancing budburst, the usage of HC is restricted in some countries due to its toxicity. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the efficiency of spraying different dormancy-breaking agents on ‘Eva’ apple tree buds, under the conditions of the Depressão Central of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Different doses of Erger® (0, 2, 3, 4, 5%) + 3% Ca(NO3)2 were tested and compared with MO (4%) or MO (4%) + HC (0.6%). Budburst rate of apical and axillary buds, physiological alterations in buds, return bloom, yield and fruit weight were evaluated. Erger® treatments efficiently enhanced budburst, with a result equivalent to HC + MO treatment. The budburst rate increased as the Erger® dose increased, also causing the increment of the return bloom in the following year. However, doses of 4 and 5% caused the death of shoots. The activity of the peroxidases and the content of H2O2 in the buds were affected by the treatments. Yield and fruit mass were different in response to treatments, although the effect varied between years. Erger® + Ca(NO3)2 spraying increase budburst in apical and axillary buds of ‘Eva’ apple tree in low-chill conditions and doses up to 3% of the commercial product do not cause toxicity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/32090/25439,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Structure and development of root gall induced by Meloidogyne javanica in Glycine max L.,"Galls formed by root-knot nematodes have been studied in several cultivated species focusing on understanding the intimate relationship between parasite and the host plant. Species of Meloidogyne induce the development of a feeding site in the cortex or vascular cylinder of the host plant and are totally dependent on this site formation to complete their life cycle. Therefore, we focused on anatomical, cytological and histochemical changes during the establishment and development of galls and giant cells induced by Meloidogyne javanica in the roots of Glycine max. Seeds of soybean (susceptible cultivar M8372 IPRO) were sown in trays with coconut fibre substrate and the seedlings were removed ten days after the seeds emerged for nematode inoculation. The roots from inoculated and non-inoculated (control) were sampled at different stages of development until 55 days after inoculation. Histological, cytological, histochemical analysis were performed in light and electron microscopy in non-galled tissue and galls induced by M. javanica. The galls showed different shapes and abundance in the roots inoculated by M. javanica. The induction of galls occurs by hypertrophy of the root cortex shortly after the initial infection process. Giant cells were formed 18 days after nematode inoculation. These giant or nourishing cells are multinucleated, and have a dense cytoplasm, a thick wall with invaginations, many mitochondria and small vacuoles. The anatomical sections indicated a disorganisation of the cells of the cortex and vascular cylinder in relation to the control root.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31810/25404,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Germination and initial development of Simira gardneriana M.R. Barbosa & Peixoto (Rubiaceae) seedlings under different temperatures and salinity levels,"Simira gardneriana M.R. Barbosa & Peixoto (Rubiaceae) is a species exclusive to the Caatinga biome. It is used as forage, firewood, and in the construction of fence posts. Species from this biome are constantly subjected to abiotic stresses, including salt and thermal stress. Thus, we evaluated the effect of irrigation water salinity on the germination and initial development of S. gardneriana seedlings at different temperatures. The experiment used seeds with an initial moisture content of about 12.32%, arranged in a factorial scheme with eight levels of salinity, obtained by the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), diluted in distilled water at concentrations of 0.0 (control), 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 dS m-1, and the four temperatures 25, 30, 35, and 20-30°C, in four replicates of 25 seeds each. Salinity and temperature effects were evaluated based on germination, germination speed index, seedling shoot length, root length, shoot dry matter, root dry matter, and total dry matter. Increasing water salinity levels interfered with all variables analyzed in the germination of S. gardneriana seeds, especially at a temperature of 35°C. At temperatures of 25 and 30°C, seed germination and initial development were less affected by salinity. Simira gardneriana seeds are sensitive to salinity caused by the increase in NaCl from 1.5 dS m-1, which indicates a low tolerance of this species to saline environments. Our results show that the negative effect on the germination and initial development of S. gardneriana seedlings can be explained by the increase in salt levels and temperature, reducing their capacity to absorb water and nutrients, which indicates sensitivity responses of this species to salinity and thermal stress.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/31539/25403,E-ISSN 1679-0359
40,2019,Electrical conductivity as an indicator of damage due to low temperatures in beans leaves,"The electrical conductivity test indirectly evaluates cell membrane disorganization by quantifying the electrolytes released into the water after tissue imbibing. The objective of this work was to evaluate methodological variations in the electrical conductivity test, for it to serve as an indicator of low temperature-induced damages and estimate the cold tolerance of bean plants. Cultivar IPR Uirapuru plants were subjected to minimum temperatures of 4 °C, 2 °C, 0 °C, -1 °C, -2 °C, -3 °C, and -4 °C for 1 h in a growth chamber under controlled conditions. After the treatment period, the response of plants to cold stress was evaluated by determination of the total protein content, and catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzymatic activities, and evaluation of photosystem II (Fm/Fv) efficiency and leaf anatomy. These results were compared with those obtained in the electrical conductivity test, which was performed in plants under cold stress as well as under a non-stress environment, with 2, 4, 6, and 8 leaf discs immersed in 30 mL of distilled water for 24 h in BOD, at temperatures of 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35°C. Analysis of variance was performed using a completely randomized design, and for electrical conductivity, a number of discs × cold stress temperature combinations were used for each soak temperature. The averages were compared using the Turkey's test at 5% and 10% probability. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the conductivity averages and other cold stress evaluation data was also performed. The results showed a marked reduction in the ratio (Fv/Fm) only in the treatments at -3 °C and -4°C, which indicated tissue death. At temperatures below 0°C, there was a collapse of the leaf blade tissues, and it was not possible to differentiate the palisade parenchyma from the spongy parenchyma in the treatments at -2°C, -3°C, and -4°C. There was an increase in the protein content since the temperature -3°C. The enzyme activity of CAT decrease at -4°C whereas that of APX increased. In the electrical conductivity test, there was a significant interaction between soak temperature and the number of discs, and an increase in conductivity of the solution with a decrease in temperature was verified in several treatments, among which, the combination that best correlated with the other tests was 25°C with six leaf discs. It was concluded that the electrical conductivity test presents results similar to those obtained from other physiological, biochemical, and anatomical tests, and therefore, it can be used to evaluate the damage caused by low temperatures in bean plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/29781/25402,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Detection of mycobacteria in coalho cheese sold in Northeastern Brazil,"The aim of the present study was to detect and identify Mycobaterium spp. in 50 samples of coalho cheese sold in the Northeast region of Brazil. Of the 50 analyzed samples, 35 were produced by the artisanal process, using raw milk, and 15 originated from industrialized establishments that pasteurize milk. Conventional and real-time nested PCR for the rv2807 gene of the M. tuberculosis complex was performed directly from the 50 analyzed samples. Samples of coalho cheese were grown simultaneously in Stonebrink medium, and conventional PCR was performed from the bacterial isolates with primers that flank differentiation region 4 (DR4), specific to M. bovis, mb400F. Bacterial isolates negative by PCR for RD4 were subjected to PCR for hsp65 of Mycobacterium spp., with subsequent DNA sequencing. The cultures were negative for the M. tuberculosis complex, but two samples (4%) from the artisanal process (with raw milk) exhibited identity with hsp65 of Mycobacterium lehmanii (Sequence ID: KY933786.1, identities: 312/363 [86%]); and Mycobacterium rutilum (sequence ID: LT629971.1, identities: 331/371 [89%]), showing to be indicative environmental contamination. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are emergent and ubiquitous microorganisms; therefore, they deserve greater attention in the cheese production chain, both in terms of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and food Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40459/28523,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A total of 650 one-day-old female Japanese quails were distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments according to the dietary levels of bee pollen (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6%), five replicates, and 26 birds per experimental unit. At the end of the experimental period (35 days of age), the performance and relative weight of the gastrointestinal organs and length of small and large intestines were evaluated. The dietary inclusion of bee pollen did not influence (P > 0.05) performance, relative weight of proventriculus, gizzard, pancreas, liver, and large intestine, as well as the length of small and large intestines. However, a linear reduction (P < 0.05) was observed in the relative weight of small intestine as dietary bee pollen levels increased. The inclusion of bee pollen from 0.4 to 1.6% in the diet of growing Japanese quails did neither improve productive performance nor alter the biometry of digestive organs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40383/29180,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Mortality of leaf-cutting ants with salicylic acid,"Strategies for the control of leaf-cutting ants have mainly involved granular baits based on fipronil and sulfluramid as active ingredients, which are commonly coated with attractive citrus-based substances. Their constant use and the lack of alternatives in the market may favor the perception of these substances by ants, causing rejection for foraging and consequent difficulty in their control. In this respect, this study examined the mortality of leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex subjected to direct application with dry powders, in laboratory conditions. As a preliminary treatment, a commercial antiseptic talc powder (C. A. P. T.) was used, followed by isolated treatments that corresponded to its components with potential insecticidal action, namely, salicylic acid, sulfur, boric acid, zinc oxide, in addition to an inert talc powder (Quimidrol®) as the control. For each treatment, 40 (worker) ants, whose activity was reduced due to remaining in a refrigerator prior to the treatment, were placed in transparent crystal polystyrene (‘Gerbox’ type) and were sprinkled with a salt shaker. The ants were kept at 25 ± 2 °C, under a 12-h photophase, and cumulative mortality was recorded every 24 h, considering dead ants as those that were unable to maintain the natural position of their body, i.e., even dying ants were considered dead when they exhibited no reaction when touched by a paintbrush. When sprinkled on ants, C. A. P. T. causes 40% mortality in both species 24 h after application. Subsequent studies of the components of this commercial product have found that when sprinkled on both Atta sexdens rubropilosa and Acromyrmex crassispinus, salicylic acid causes 100% mortality of workers in the first 24 h. This result provides a new prospect of control through a low environmental-impact product, representing an alternative for control in nests in the field that can contribute to the integrated control of ants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41565/29679,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Pasture weed biology and management in Brazil,"The livestock production model historically practiced in Brazil has a strong extractive bias, wherein the premise is to produce livestock with absolutely no concern for the preservation or renewal of environmental resources. The absence of technical criteria for the use of pastures has generated low productivity rates, making the activity unsustainable from both economic and environmental points of view. This scenario led the several sectors linked to the production chain to develop a package of strategies to solve the problems faced by livestock farmers. This package of strategies is conventionally called postmodern or corporate farming, in which the extractive process gives way to the business logic of avoiding waste and recovering profit margins mainly through pasture perpetuation. However, there is still a technical gap in corporate cattle farming related to problems caused by pasture weeds because all the concepts applied are derived or copied from concepts generated in agriculture. Furthermore, few researchers have studied or scientific articles written on elucidating the real problem of weeds in livestock production. Thus, the goal of the present review was to present some aspects related to weed ecology, their interference, and management alternatives in pasture areas, thereby collaborating with corporate livestock farming in Brazil because solutions to weed problems are crucial to increase commitment in all sectors of the production chain.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43106/30596,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Libido and serving skills of Zebu cattle bulls,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the rejection rates of Zebu bulls during behavioral assessment (libido and serving ability) and the importance of this step in bull breeding soundness evaluation (BBSE). A total of 1,534 bulls reared in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, of Nelore (1,340), Brahman (76), Guzerá (98), and Tabapuã (210) breeds were evaluated. The evaluation consisted of four steps. Step I was the general physical examination, Step II genital tract examination, Step III semen evaluation, and Step IV behavioral assessment of libido and the ability to complete copulation. To evaluate the relationship between the binary variables of approved or rejected during different steps of the BBSE, and age groups (young and mature bulls), chi-square tests and logistic regression were used. The general rejection rates in the BBSE were 5.64% and 15.20% for young and mature Zebu bulls, respectively. ¬Problems with the sexual behavior (libido and/or serving ability) of bulls accounted for the rejection of 0.46% and 2.29% of young and mature Zebu bulls, respectively. The lack of libido and serving ability was shown to be an important problem concerning the total number of possible causes of Zebu bull rejection during the BBSE. This result suggests that the behavioral step should be performed regularly, rather than being complementary to the standard BBSE in Zebu cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41993/30691,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Potassium nutrition as a strategy to mitigate salt stress in melon grown under protected cultivation,"The use of saline water is one of the major challenges of agriculture, as it can cause nutritional imbalances and thus reduce crop yield. This study proposes to examine the efficiency of potassium nutrition as a salt stress-mitigating agent in melon grown in a protected environment. The experiment was laid out in a randomized-block design with ten treatments in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement represented by two melon cultivars (McLaren and SV1044MF) and four nutrient solutions (S1 - standard nutrient solution, 2.5 dS m-1; S2 - nutrient solution salinized with NaCl, 5.0 dS m-1; S3 - nutrient solution salinized with NaCl + 50% K, 6.5 dS m-1; and S4 - nutrient solution salinized with NaCl + 100% K, 7.5 dS m-1). Yield (average fruit weight, production, fruit diameter, internal cavity, and pulp thickness), quality (pulp firmness, total sugars, soluble solids [SS], vitamin C, pH, titratable acidity [TA] and SS/TA ratio) and nutritional (K, Na and K/Na ratio) variables were evaluated. Plants fertigated with standard nutrient solution showed the highest values for fruit weight (1,190.6 g), production (2,381.3 g per plant), fruit diameter (13.6 cm) and pulp thickness (2.6 cm). Cultivar McLaren produced heavier fruits (931.4 g) with larger diameter (12.4 cm) and pulp thickness (2.4 cm). The addition of NaCl to nutrient solution induced a reduction in the yield variables but did not influence fruit quality. The addition of extra K to salinized nutrient solution did not mitigate the deleterious effect of salinity on the yield of melon.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43284/30054,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Parasitism capacity of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 and Telenomus remus Nixon, 1937 after ingestion of biological pesticides","Augmentative biological control (ABC) of insect pests is an environmentally sustainable alternative to synthetic insecticides. By performing BC, more than one control agent can be used for the same insect pest that is in different stages of its life cycle or for pests that simultaneously occur in the area. However, this relationship requires biosecurity for the control agents employed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the parasitism capacity of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 and Telenomus remus Nixon, 1937 after ingestion of biological pesticides. The entomopathogens, Baculovirus Anticarsia gemmatalis nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV), Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. kurstaki, Bt var. aizawai, Beauveria bassiana, and Metarhizium anisopliae; the microbiological fungicide, Trichoderma harzianum, at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer; and a negative control (pure honey) were employed in this study. Further, forced ingestion was adopted, with the treatments mixed in honey and offered as food at two dilutions (one-part product: one-part honey and one-part product: nine parts honey). Each treatment consisted of 20 individual females for each parasitoid (T. pretiosum or T. remus). The following parameters were evaluated: female longevity, number of parasitized eggs, egg viability, and number of females and males to determine the sex ratio. For T. pretiosum, B. bassiana (1 × 1013 viable conidia 100 L H2O-1), and T. harzianum (5 × 1012 viable conidia 100 L H2O-1), the longevity of their females was reduced by the 1:1 mixture; however, this mixture did not interfere with other parameters and other biological pesticides compared to the respective controls of both dilutions. The biological pesticides did not negatively influence the parameters evaluated for T. remus. The tested products had low toxicity to the egg parasitoids, T. pretiosum and T. remus. Overall, more work is still required with parasitoids in other stages of development and with other exposure methods to confirm the selectivity of products for egg parasitoids to recommend its combined use in the field.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44611/31773,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Sources of acid insoluble ash as marker of corn digestibility in broilers,"The objective was to evaluate three sources of acid insoluble ash (AIA) (celite, kaolin, and sand), as indicators, to determine the apparent metabolizable energy of corn on a natural matter (AME) basis, dry matter digestibility coefficient (DMDC), and crude protein digestibility coefficient (CPDC) using total and partial excreta collection methods. Two hundred and ten Ross broiler chicks of 18 to 27 days of age were used. Broilers were adapted to experimental the diet for four days, and excreta were collected for 5 days. A reference diet (RD) based on corn and soybean meal was prepared to meet the nutritional requirements of the birds. A test diet was prepared with 40% replacement of RD with corn. The formulated diets were: D1, 99% Reference diet + 1% celite; D2, 59.4% RD + 39.6 % corn + 1% celite; D3, 99% Reference diet + 1% kaolin; D4, 59.4% RD + 39.6 % corn + 1% kaolin; D5, 99% Reference diet + 1% sand; D6, 59.4% RD + 39.6 % corn + 1% sand. The treatments were distributed in a completely randomized design, with six diets and five replicates of seven birds each in a 2x3 factorial arrangement. There were significant interactions for all variables investigated. It was observed that the AME and DMDC values of corn were similar in the two methods of collection, and CPDC values using kaolin and celite makers were similar. However, the AME and CPDC of corn using sand with partial collection method were underestimated by 17.70 and 15.53%, respectively compared to those with the total collection method. The AME values of corn with the collection methods using celite and, the DMDC using celite and sand were significantly different. It was observed that the DMDC using celite and sand provided significantly lower values (4.67 and 5.15%), respectively, and the AME using celite was 2.86% lower than that obtained by total collection. To determine the EMA, DMDC, and CPDC in broilers, it is more efficient to use celiteTM and kaolin as markers with partial collection of excreta. Sand should not be used with partial excreta collection method, because it provides lower values of AME and CPDC compared to with total excreta collection method.xos de AME e CPDC em comparação com o método de coleta total de excreta.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44505/30845,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Vegetative propagation of hops (Humulus lupulus L.): Historical approach and perspectives,"Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) female inflorescences are important raw materials used to produce beers, cosmetics, and medicines. Vegetative propagation is the preferred way of obtaining seedlings for commercial cultivations as female plants produce more lupulin than male plants, a component of commercial interest. It can be carried out by macropropagation (stem cuttings or rhizomes) or micropropagation. This review aimed to systematize different techniques of hop vegetative propagation, with no time frame, from searches in the main academic research bases: Capes Journal Portal, Scielo, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate. Most studies are related to micropropagation, mainly addressing different plant regulators and concentrations, as well as types of explants and culture media, strategies to produce virus-free plants, artificial lighting, and cryopreservation. Experiments with stem cuttings are more common regarding macropropagation, but factors such as size and origin of cuttings, rooting period, and the response of different cultivars need to be better evaluated. Cultivation by cuttings allows the production of clones of female plants and micropropagation the production of virus-free clones in a short time and less physical space. Currently, micropropagation has been widely applied to cryopreservation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/45106/31730,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Apicomplexa parasites in the brains of road-killed wild animals in the State of Paraná, Brazil","The use of run-over wild animals is an efficient strategy for scientific research of pathogens. The aim of this study was to detect DNA from phylum Apicomplexa in the brain of road-killed wild animals from the North-Central and North Pioneer mesoregions of Paraná, Brazil. Pre-established transects were run weekly; when found, animals were packed into individual packages and sent for autopsy. The brain fragments were collected and kept at -20 ° C until processing. The DNA extracted from the samples was amplified by nested-PCR for the 18S rDNA gene from the phylum Apicomplexa. All positive samples were submitted to DNA sequencing to define the species. A total of 90 animals were collected, however, only 68 animals (75.6%) that had integrity of the brain were included in the study. It was possible to identify the species by DNA sequencing in four samples: Sarcocystis spp. was identified in one Colaptes melanochloros (Green-barred woodpecker) and one Mazama gouazoubira (Gray brocket). Neospora caninum was observed in a Leopardus pardalis (Ocelot) and T. gondii was present in Didelphis albiventris (white-eared opossum).

43,2022,Antimicrobial resistance profile of Staphylococcus spp. isolates in cattle herds from Western Amazon,"Staphylococcus is one of the most frequent etiological agents of bovine mastitis, causing economic losses to milk farming. This study aimed to describe the milk production and management practices in 15 herds located in three microregions of the State of Rondônia and to identify the antimicrobial resistance profile of 97 isolates of the genus Staphylococcus from these herds. The isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests using the agar diffusion method. Twenty-nine S. aureus isolates were selected to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In the farms studied, the breeding system was semi-intensive, with the Girolando breed being predominant. Milking was performed predominantly using a mechanical milking system (86.7%), twice a day (66.7%), in the presence of the calf (53.8%). The average number of lactating cows in the farms was 24, with an average milk production of 204.9 L d-1 and a milk productivity of 10.2 L animal-1 d-1. The use of antimicrobials for the treatment and prevention of bovine mastitis was reported for all properties, and therapy for dry cows was adopted in 80% of the herds. The percent susceptibility to antimicrobials ranged from 85.5% to 100% for S. aureus, 22.2% to 88.9% for coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and 69.2% to 100% for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), with the highest resistance frequencies for penicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline. Among the S. aureus isolates, 100% susceptibility to oxacillin, cefalexin, and gentamicin was observed, and among the CNS isolates, 100% susceptibility to gentamicin was observed. None of the antimicrobials tested showed 100% in vitro effectiveness for CPS. CPS and CNS presented lower percentages of susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline than the S. aureus isolates. Twelve resistance patterns were detected, six of which were multiresistance patterns. The most prevalent resistance patterns were penicillin and ampicillin (PEN-AMP) and penicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline (PEN-AMP-TET). Results of the MIC assay revealed that all 29 S. aureus isolates were susceptible to cephalothin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, whereas 25 (86.2%) were susceptible to penicillin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44531/31652,E-ISSN 1679-0359

(lima bean) is a species of the Fabaceae family widely cultivated in the Northeast region of Brazil and is an important source of nutrients for the population. The lima bean has high genetic variability, which results in many cultivated varieties. However, there is little information about the cyanide levels, nutritional quality and sensory acceptance of these varieties, as well as about the changes caused by the cooking process, especially with regard to free cyanide contents. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the cyanide contents, nutritional quality and sensory attributes of lima bean varieties. Potential and free cyanide levels, quality attributes and a Qualitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) were evaluated in raw and cooked grains. The study was carried out in a completely randomized design, with five lima bean varieties (Orelha de Vó, Branca, Roxinha, Rosinha, and Cearense), in 4 replications. Relatively to the raw ones, cooked grains presented larger size and smaller contents of ash, proteins, carbohydrates, potential cyanide and free cyanide, in the studied varieties. The Orelha de Vó lima bean showed higher mass of raw and higher firmness of cooked grains, which was judged to have the bitterest flavor among the others but showed safe levels of free cyanide after cooking. When cooked, Branca lima bean had a greater intention of purchase and global acceptance, due to its greater intensity of characteristic aroma and lower residual bitter taste.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44378/31649,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Silicon increases the production and quality of cherry tomato under different electrical conductivity levels,"The addition of high nutrient concentrations to irrigation water increases its electrical conductivity by contributing to its salinity, resulting in crop yield losses. However, in cases where stress conditions are not observed, silicon can act as a biostimulant and promote vegetative growth, fruit quality, and fruit production. From this perspective, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of fertigation with different electrical conductivity levels associated with potassium silicate on the production parameters of cherry tomatoes grown in a protected environment. The study was conducted in Bom Jesus - PI, and arranged in a randomized block design with four replications and a 6 x 2 factorial corresponding to six electrical conductivity levels (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 dS m-1) in the absence and presence of silicon (2 mmol L-1). The variables analyzed were the number of fruits per plant, fresh and dry fruit biomass, dry biomass of stem, leaves, bunches, root, shoot, and whole plant; and chemical quality of fruits (pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and the ratio of total soluble solids to titratable acidity. Silicon supplementation increased the root and shoot dry masses and improved fruits quality, thus increasing cherry tomato production (Sweet Heaven hybrid) regardless of the electrical conductivity levels.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43879/31648,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Animal abuse and interpersonal violence from the perspective of veterinarians from Paraíba State, Brazil","This study aimed to obtain information about the knowledge and attitudes of veterinarians in the state of Paraíba, Brazil, regarding the care of abused animals, the profile of possible aggressors, and their perceptions of the relationship between animal maltreatment and interpersonal violence. For this purpose, an online survey containing 21 questions was made available to veterinarians registered in the Regional Veterinary Medicine Council of Paraíba (CRMV - PB). The chi-square test with a 5% significance level (p < 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. According to the interviewees, 70.7% (53/75) of the abuse victims were small animals. Negligence (68% [51/75]) and the absence of medical care (68% [51/75]) were the most evident forms of abuse. Furthermore, 82.7% (62/75) of them believed in the relationship between animal maltreatment and interpersonal violence. In addition, 90.7% (68/75) of the interviewees responded that they have not experienced technical difficulty in identifying maltreatment. However, 48% (36/75) stated to not know the animal abuse law, 90.7% (68/75) did not report the aggressors, and 81.3% (61/75) stated that the absence of measures by the competent public bodies makes it harder to report the abuse. This study concluded that these professionals will, at some point in their clinical routine, encounter situations of animal maltreatment and human violence, as they are in a privileged position to identify such acts. However, they need more normative knowledge about animal abuse crimes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/45054/31646,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Prevalence of brucellosis in beef cattle in the northern region of Tocantins, Brazil, and implications of anatomopathological changes discovered during post mortem inspection of the carcass","Brucellosis is a infectious zoonosis with important health and economic impacts, both for animal production and public health. We aimed to determine the prevalence of brucellosis in beef cattle in the microregions of Araguaína and Bico do Papagaio in northern Tocantins and to verify whether there are post-mortem changes suggestive of brucellosis in the carcasses. A total of 2,871 serum samples (2,203 males and 668 females) were collected in the municipality of Araguaína between October and November 2019, from 76 beef cattle herds in 25 municipalities in the north of Tocantins. The screening for buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPA) and confirmation test for 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) were conducted as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply (MAPA). Of the samples, 37.31% were reactive in the BAPA test, and of these, 26.24% were confirmed for 2-ME. Thus, 9.79% (281) of the total evaluated samples tested positive for the presence of brucellosis. The prevalence in males and females was 6.45% (142) and 20.81% (139), respectively. Among the herds evaluated, 77.6% (59) had at least one individual test positive for brucellosis, and at least one herd tested positive in each of the 25 municipalities sampled. As this study evaluated animals in a slaughterhouse, the higher prevalence of positive females may have been related to the disposal of animals with reproductive problems. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of brucellosis in slaughter cattle between the microregions evaluated (p > 0.05). No animals were reagent for brucellosis in ante-mortem documentation, and no anatomopathological changes suggestive of brucellosis were observed during post-mortem inspection. The most frequent post-mortem findings were contamination (43.91%), blood aspiration (17.36%), and pulmonary emphysema (15.98%). Considering the official results of the monitoring programs of the state of Tocantins and previous studies, post-mortem macroscopic inspection of carcasses may not be enough to detect animals with this zoonosis, and it may be necessary to take measures to promote animal and public health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44305/31647,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design, in a 2 × 3 factorial scheme, with and without (control) inoculant consisting of Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium acidipropionici and on three crops, corn, sorghum and pearl millet, with four replicates. The use of the inoculant did not affect the chemical composition of the silages, except the crude protein (P = 0.0062) and lignin (P = 0.0567) contents. Gas production was neither affected (P > 0.05) by the inoculant nor by the crop. Regarding aerobic stability, we observed that the inoculant affected the temperature of the sorghum silage (P = 0.0123). The inoculant decreased the N-NH3 (P =0.0095) content and increased (P = 0.0441) the lactic acid bacteria population in the silages.

43,2022,"Gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and photochemical efficiency of sesame under salt stress and phosphate fertilization","Salt stress is a threat to irrigated agriculture, especially in semi-arid regions, as it can cause irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus at any stage of plant development, reducing chlorophyll biosynthesis, which compromises the photochemical efficiency and the photosynthetic process of plants. In this respect, phosphorus fertilization stands out as an alternative to mitigate the effects of salt stress on plants. Therefore, the present study investigated the growth, gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and photochemical efficiency of sesame cv. BRS Seda irrigated with saline water and fertilized with phosphorus. The experiment was carried out in pots adapted as lysimeters in a greenhouse in Pombal - PB, Brazil. Treatments were distributed in randomized blocks and analyzed in a 5 × 4 factorial arrangement with five levels of electrical conductivity of water (ECw: 0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7, and 3.5 dS m-1) and four phosphorus rates (40, 70, 100, and 130% of the recommended dose for pot trials), in three replicates. The 100% recommendation consisted of applying 300 mg P2O5 kg-1 of soil. Sesame growth, chloroplast pigments, and gas exchange decreased with water salinity above 0.3 dS m-1. The application of 100 and 130% of the recommended phosphorus rate minimized the effects of salt stress on CO2 assimilation rate and photosynthetic pigment synthesis. The increase from 40 to 130% of the recommended phosphorus rate did not change the photochemical efficiency of sesame cv.

43,2022,"Morphophysiology, growth indices, and fruiting of pumpkin in response to organic amendments","A field study was carried out to examine the effects of organic amendment on the morpho-physiology, growth indices, and fruiting of pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) plants. The pumpkin seedlings were raised in polybags and treated without fertilizer (control), cow dung, goat dung, poultry dung, vermicompost, compost, and inorganic fertilizer (NPK). The results showed that poultry dung and cow dung treatments significantly increased the length of vine, leaf number, leaf area, and leaf dry weight of pumpkin plants. Poultry dung treatment increased the absolute growth rate (AGR), relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf area duration (LAD), and fresh plant biomass by 345%, 287%, 770%, 384%, 415%, and 1139%, respectively over the control plants. Poultry dung treatment also increased the internode length and initiated flowers earlier than the control. Petiole length, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll content were 5.59, 1.49, and 1.41 times higher with NPK treatment compared to the control group.

43,2022,Effect of bactofugation of raw milk on total bacterial and aerobic spore counts and on microbial diversity of sporeformers,"This study describes the effect of bactofugation (10,000 × g in a continuous flow of 10,000 L/h) of three batches of raw milk on total bacterial count (TBC) and aerobic spore count, and it also shows the effect on the microbial diversity of spore-forming bacteria by analysing their genetic variability through molecular approaches. Given that milk must be preheated to approximately 55 °C before being bactofuged, for comparison, the three batches were evaluated at different stages as refrigerated raw, preheated, and bactofuged milk. For preheated milk, it was found that bactofugation caused a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of 99.52% (from 4.5 × 106 to 2.1 × 104 CFU/mL) in the mean TBC and of 95% (from 333 to 17 CFU/mL) in the aerobic mesophilic spore count. Due to the effect of bactofugation on preheated milk, a reduction of 82% was observed in both TBC and aerobic spore count. With respect to diversity, 107 isolates from raw milk, prior to bactofugation, and 16 isolates from bactofuged milk were recovered and grouped into 40 and 8 clusters, respectively. The predominant species detected in raw and preheated milk were Bacillus toyonensis (63% - 20 clusters) and Lysinibacillus fusiformis (15% - 8 clusters). Proportionally, B. toyonensis (69% - 6 clusters) and L. fusiformis (25% - 1 cluster) were predominant in bactofuged milk. B. pumilus, L. varians, B. flexus, B. invictae, and B. megaterium, bacteria with a known milk spoilage potential, were isolated from milk prior to bactofugation, and they reduced to undetectable levels in bactofuged milk. Bactofugation of milk, therefore, reduces the TBC and aerobic spore count, with a significant effect in reducing the microbial diversity of spore-forming bacteria, proportional to their incidence in raw milk. Therefore, bactofugation can be an alternative to increase the shelf life and technological potential of milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43980/31641,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Hydrogen peroxide and saline nutrient solution in hydroponic zucchini culture,"Saline water has been used in irrigation due to the limited availability of fresh water, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the use of this type of water can affect crop growth and development. Studies have tested the use of chemical conditioners to minimize the negative effects of salinity on plants. In this scenario, the present study examined the role of hydrogen peroxide in mitigating the negative effects of salt stress on zucchini plants grown in a hydroponic system. The study was carried out in a greenhouse in Pombal - PB, Brazil. The NFT (nutrient film technique) hydroponic system was employed. A randomized complete experimental design was set up with a 4 × 4 factorial arrangement consisting of four levels of electrical conductivity in the nutrient solution (ECns: 2.1 [control], 3.6, 5.1, and 6.6 dS m-1) and four concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2: 0, 20, 40, and 60 uM), in three replicates. Foliar spraying with H2O2 at 60 and 40 uM associated with the nutrient solution of 2.1 dS m-1 increased stem diameter and root length, respectively, at 47 days after transplanting. However, at ECns higher than 2.1 dS m-1, the application of H2O2 at the concentrations of 60 and 40 uM intensified salt stress, reducing stem diameter and root length. Nutrient solution salinity levels above 2.1 dS m-1 reduce photosynthetic pigments; the number of leaves; leaf area; the length of the main branch; and the dry biomass of stems, leaves, and roots of zucchini plants. Chlorophyll b and carotenoid contents are the variables most sensitive to changes in salinity levels.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43137/31640,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In this scenario, the present study was developed to examine the effects of different salicylic acid (SA) application methods on photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll a fluorescence, gas exchange, and biomass accumulation of cherry tomato under salt stress. The study was carried out in a greenhouse, using a Regosol soil (Psamments) with a sandy-loam texture. The treatments were distributed in a completely randomized design, in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement consisting of two levels of electrical conductivity in the irrigation water (0.6 or 2.6 dS m-1) and four salicylic acid application methods (M1 = without SA [control] application; M2 = foliar spray; M3 = irrigation; or M4 = spray and irrigation), with five replicates. Irrigation with 2.6 dS m-1 salinity water negatively affected chlorophyll a fluorescence and the total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, and carotenoid contents, in addition to inhibiting stem dry biomass production and root/shoot ratio. Foliar spray with salicylic acid minimized the deleterious effects of salt stress on gas exchange and chlorophyll content and increased leaf and root dry biomass accumulation and the root/shoot ratio of cherry tomatoes at 120 days after sowing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43299/31639,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study aimed to evaluate the biochemical and physiological changes in seeds of different soybean cultivars submitted to delayed harvest in the field. Seeds of the cultivars NS 5959, BMX Potência, and TMG 1175 were harvested at four times (0, 10, 20, and 30 days after reaching R8). Moisture, germination, first count, accelerated aging, emergence, and tetrazolium tests were performed in each harvest period. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were also evaluated. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design in a 3×4 factorial scheme (three cultivars and four harvest times). A reduction in germination and vigor of seeds of different soybean cultivars was found at R8 + 20 and R8 + 30 days related to field deterioration due to delayed harvest. The seeds of the cultivars did not differ in terms of viability under delayed harvest but differed in terms of antioxidant and physiological responses.

Of the individuals found, 7,418 were collected during autumn, 7,320 in summer, 5,553 in winter, and 5,498 in spring. The soil macrofauna was influenced by seasonality, with a higher density of individuals in autumn and summer. Regarding functional groups, social groups were dominant in all areas and seasons, comprising 74.50% of the total number of individuals. The detritivores group comprised 17.98% of the total individuals. Herbivores, snails, and slugs accounted for 3.98% of the total individuals. The functional groups detritivores, herbivores, and predators were more abundant in the litter, while the social groups were predominant in the soil depths of 0 to 30 cm. As the forest progressed, the richness of the macrofauna groups increased, demonstrating the influence of successional dynamics on the composition of the soil macrofauna.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44407/31637,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Influence of base saturation on buckwheat grain and flavonoid production,"Fagopyrum esculentum is highly nutritious due to its proteins of high biological value and high fiber content. Its most relevant property is nonetheless its antioxidant activity, provided by the presence of flavonoids. It is an important pseudocereal in agriculture, animal production, and human food. The objective of study was to evaluate the grain yield and flavonoid production of Fagopyrum esculentum cultivars as a function of base saturation. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with four replicates. Treatments were represented by cultivars IPR 91 and IPR 92 and five base saturation levels (9, 31, 53, 75, and 97 %), in a factorial arrangement (2 × 5). Agronomic attributes and total-flavonoid and rutin contents and production were evaluated. Subsequently, the data were subjected to statistical analysis. Base saturation does not affect flavonoid production. However, base saturation influences shoot dry matter yield (maximum at 62.0% base saturation) and grain yield (maximum at 9.00%) in IPR 92. The higher-yielding cultivar is IPR 92. This is the first scientific report of base saturation in the species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43410/31636,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Accelerated ageing test and enzymatic expression in the evaluation of kale seed quality,"The demand for high-quality vegetable seeds and the production of vigorous seedlings has increased in recent years, as these characteristics are determining factors of production success. Vegetables are growing in national importance, and kale stands out as an important source of income for small farmers. The objective of this study was to adapt the traditional accelerated aging test methodology with a saturated NaCl solution of kale seeds and evaluate the enzymatic activity after the vigour test. Six batches of kale seeds were used, and the moisture content, weight of one thousand seeds, first germination count, germination, germination speed index, emergence, initial stand, and emergence velocity index were determined. In the accelerated ageing test, the seeds were submitted to the traditional accelerated ageing test method and the accelerated ageing test method with a saturated NaCl solution for ageing periods of 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Electrophoretic analysis of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isoenzymes was also performed. The accelerated ageing test, using the traditional method for 72 hours at 41 °C, is adequate for evaluating the physiological potential of kale seeds. The isoenzymatic analyses of SOD, CAT, and ADH demonstrate that the biochemical markers are efficient at differentiating kale seeds after accelerated ageing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44103/31635,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Supplementation strategies for lactating F1 Holstein x Zebu cows on deferred pastures,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrate supplementation strategies to lactating F1 Holstein x Zebu cows managed on deferred signal grass pasture on milk yield, composition and body weight gain. Thirty-six F1 Holstein x Zebu cows with average days in milk of 102 ± 10 and body weight of 501 ± 19 kg were allotted to a 4 x 5 completely randomized factorial design, with four feeding strategies and five weeks of evaluation. The treatments consisted of four nutritional strategies: deferred pasture as a source of roughage + 700 grams of protein supplement (PDPI); deferred pasture as a source of roughage + 1,200 grams of protein supplement (PDPII); deferred pasture + 15 kilograms of corn silage (natural basis) + 1,200 grams of protein supplement (PDSP) and corn silage (ad libitum) + 700 grams of protein supplement (CSS). There was no interaction (P = 0.99) between supplementation strategies and test days on milk yield and chemical composition. The mean milk yield of cows managed on PDPI, PDPII and PDSP was 11.50 kg/day (P > 0.05), which was 14.30% lower than that of cows managed on CSS. Fat content (P < 0.01), protein (P < 0.01), lactose (P < 0.01), defatted dry extract (DDE) (P< 0 .01), total solids (P < 0.01) and milk casein (P < 0.01) were affected by different supplementation strategies.

43,2022,Water restriction periods affect growth performance and nutritional status of Santa Inês sheep in the Brazilian Semi-arid,"This study aimed to assess the growth performance and nutritional status of sheep under intermittent water supply by means of performance, intake, apparent digestibility of nutrients, water balance and nitrogen. Thirty-two intact male sheep (20.7 ± 2.63 kg, 8 months of age) were distributed in a completely randomized design with 4 water supply intervals via drinking trough (0h00, 24h00, 48h00, and 72h00), with 8 replicates. The extension in the water restriction period caused a reduction in the intake of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, digestible energy, and metabolizable energy (P < 0.05). The digestibility coefficients of dry matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber showed a linear decrease with increasing periods of water restriction (P < 0.05). Water intake via food, total water intake, and water excretion via feces showed a linear increase in response to an increase in the water supply interval (P < 0.05). Water intake via drinking, metabolic water, total water excretion and water balance presented a linear decrease, with increasing periods of water restriction (P < 0.05). Nitrogen intake and absorbed nitrogen were influenced by water restriction, presenting a linear decreasing trend according to water supply periods (P < 0.05). Final weight, daily weight gain, and total weight gain, were influenced by the periods of water restriction, showing a linear reduction (P < 0.05). Feed conversion increased as the water restriction period increased (P=0.004). Intermittent water supply at intervals of up to 72h00 reduced nutrient intake and digestibility, resulting in a decrease in weight gain of the studied animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43132/31632,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Poultry litter biochar rates and incubation times: effects on soil fertility and radish development,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing rates of poultry litter biochar incubated in soil for different periods on soil fertility attributes and the development of the radish plant. An experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at the Federal University of Campina Grande - UFCG. Treatments consisted of the combination of two factors: four incubation times (0, 30, 60, and 90 days) and four biochar rates (12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0 t ha-1), in three replications, totalizing 48 experimental plots, in a completely randomized design. After the incubation period, soil samples were collected from each experimental unit and chemically characterized. Following this, radish was sown and cultivated for up to 30 days. The agronomic development of radish was evaluated based on the following variables: leaf area; leaf area ratio; specific leaf area; shoot biomass production index; transverse and longitudinal tuber diameters; and fresh and dry tuber biomasses. Under the present experimental conditions, biochar increases soil fertility levels and is able to supply nutrients to the plants in a short period, increasing plant variables.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43758/31633,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Machine learning applied to the prediction of root architecture of soybean cultivars under two water availability conditions,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of four machine learning models, as well as multitask learning, to predict soybean root variables from simpler variables, under two water availability conditions. In order to do so, 100 soybean cultivars were conducted in a greenhouse under a control condition and a stress condition. Aerial part and root variables were evaluated. The machine learning models used to predict complex root variables were artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (EGBoost) and support vector machine (SVM). A linear model was used for comparison purposes. Multitask learning was employed for ANN and RF. In addition, feature importance was defined using RF and XGBoost algorithms. All the machine learning models performed better than the linear model. In general, SVM had the greatest potential for the prediction of most of the root variables, with better values of RMSE, MAE and R2. Dry weight of the aerial part and root volume exhibited the greatest importance in the predictions. The models developed using multitask learning performed similarly to the ones conventionally developed. Finally, it is concluded that the machine learning models evaluated can be used to predict root variables of soybean from easily measurable variables, such as dry weight of the aerial part and root volume.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43290/31631,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Different prepartum feeding systems on ewe metabolic profile and lamb growth,"Identifying the metabolic profile of farm animals constitutes an important tool for the clinical diagnosis of metabolic diseases that can affect animal production performance. This study investigates the prepartum metabolic profile of ewes reared in two feeding systems native pasture and cultivated pasture of black oat and ryegrass and their effects on lamb development. Forty adult Texel ewes and their lambs were used and evaluated for metabolites representative of energy, protein, and mineral metabolism in the prepartum period. Ewes kept on cultivated pasture exhibited higher glucose levels than those kept on native pasture (59.67 vs. 31.98 mg/dL, respectively), whereas those kept on native pasture had higher serum Ca and P levels (7.62 and 4.58 mg/dL, respectively) than the ewes on cultivated pasture (6.21 and 3.73 mg/dL, respectively). Albumin was higher in the ewes with single pregnancy (2.92 vs. 2.76 g/dL), while urea levels were affected by the interaction between feeding system and type of pregnancy. Prepartum levels of glucose, phosphorus, and calcium in the blood of the ewes were correlated with lamb weight at 30 days. The feeding system influenced the metabolic profile of the ewes in the prepartum period, with lamb weight at 30 days of age being mainly associated with the mother's glucose level at the end of the gestation period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44524/31630,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Initial vegetative and reproductive development of coffee cultivars in Vale do Ribeira Paulista,"This research is related to the performance evaluation of twelve Coffea arabica cultivars in Vale do Ribeira Paulista, in order to generate consistent information for the technical recommendation for cultivation in the region. The experiment was set in February 2018, at the Experimental Campus of the São Paulo State University “Júlio de Mesquita Filho” - UNESP in Registro, SP, Brazil, in a spacing of 3.00x0.60 m, in a randomized block design with three replications. The following parameters were evaluated: stem diameter, number of plagiotropic branches, plant height, number of internodes of plagiotropic branches, length of the first plagiotropic branch, incidence of brown spots and phoma leaf spot, infestation by leaf miner and yield. The results showed a good adaptation of all cultivars to growing conditions in Vale do Ribeira Paulista, with higher and faster vegetative development of large coffee cultivars. The productive potential of cultivars in the first harvest was similar to the performance of the same cultivars in traditional growing regions, with emphasis on ‘Arara’ and ‘Catucaí Amarelo 24/137’, with about 55 bags ha-1 of processed coffee.

43,2022,Reference gene stability in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle of Colombian Creole sheep,"The Colombian Creole sheep breed has a high economic and social importance for Colombia. Both males and females of this breed are multipurpose animals, and evaluating the production and meat quality of both sexes is important for small farmers in Colombia. This requires the use of tools that help to evaluate critical production points, such as Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which is a widely used molecular tool for the relative quantification of candidate genes in various tissues. For its correct use, the use of housekeeping genes with stable expression, so-called “reference genes”, is required. However, recent studies have shown that the expression of these reference genes can vary among tissues and can be modulated by breed, sex, or external stimuli. Likewise, there is little information regarding the expression of these genes in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle of male and female Colombian Creole sheep. In this study, the stability in the expression of seven reference genes (ACTB, YWHAZ, SDHA, GAPDH, TUBB2A, B2M, and PGK1) in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle of male and female Colombian Creole sheep was compared since they are used in RT-qPCR studies to determine the most stable ones for this breed. Twelve animals, six males and six females, with a body weight of 26 ± 4 kg and 12 ± 3 months of age, were used under grazing conditions. Biopsies of the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle were taken, from which RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. Expression was determined using RT-qPCR, and its stability was analyzed by computational algorithms using the geNorm, Normfinder, and BestKeeper software packages, which were integrated using the RefFinder software package. The results indicate that GAPDH, ACTB, and SDHA have the highest stability, whereas the most variable expression was found for B2M. These data provide the basis for more precise results in RT-qPCR studies of gene expression in the muscle of Colombian Creole sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44494/31629,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Relative transcript level of BMP15, BAX and CASP3 with qRT-PCR in vitrified equine immature cumulus-oocytes complexes","Research focused on female gamete vitrification has increased attention to develop a reliable cryopreservation method to preserve immature equine oocytes. Despite the intensive implementation of biotechnological procedures for horse breeding, vitrification of immature equine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) remain to be clearly elucidated. We aimed to determine the relative transcript level of target genes Bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15); Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX); and Caspase 3 (CASP3) in equine COCs prior to and after vitrification. Ovarian follicles were aspirated from ovaries collected from an abattoir. A total of 240 COCs were collected and distributed into vitrified COCs (VIT, n=120) and non-vitrified (Non-VIT, n=120) groups. Then, COCs were preserved and relative transcript expressions of BMP15, BAX, CASP3 were measured and normalized against GAPDH performed by qRT-PCR. In addition, 38 COCs were evaluated to assess chromatin configuration of germinal vesicle stage prior and after vitrification by exposure to 10 ug/ml of bisbenzimide. A difference was observed in the COCs mRNA level of abundance for the BAX gene between the VIT (2.05 ± 0.47) and (0.85 ± 0.08) Non-VIT groups. There was no difference in mRNA relative transcript level of CASP3 and BMP15 in Non-VIT (0.63 ± 0.20 and 1.55 ± 0.73, respectively) compared to VIT (0.64 ± 0.01 and 2.84 ± 2.20, respectively) equine COCs. All COCs where considered at immature stage of development even though COCs in Non-VIT group showed higher condensed chromatin configuration compared to VIT (100% vs 60.7%, respectively). We demonstrate that BMP15 and CASP3 are detected in VIT and Non-VIT immature COCs. In conclusion, BAX is expressed highly in vitrified immature equine COCs and indicates that activation of apoptosis signaling cascades in cells exposed to vitrification.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44029/31625,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Factors affecting the individual consumption level of milk and dairy products,"The quality and quantity of the demand for milk and dairy products are important indicators for the relevant sector stakeholders. This study aims to examine the amount and differences in individual milk and dairy products consumption, together with the factors affecting this consumption. The study was conducted through a survey on 221 consumers in Hatay, which is a multicultural and cosmopolitan city in Turkey. Monthly average consumptions of milk, cheese, yogurt, ayran/yogurt drink, butter, and milk equivalent products were determined to be 3.45 kg, 0.95 kg, 3.79 kg, 1.32 kg, 0.29 kg, and 30.55 kg, respectively. Consumption frequency was found to be “more than once a week” for milk and “every day” for dairy products. Statistically, men consume more ayran and butter than women (P < 0.05). There are significant differences among different income groups in terms of butter consumption, and among different education groups in terms of “milk and ayran” consumption (P < 0.05). Significant relationships in a positive direction were determined between height and education level and “ayran”; between weight and income level and “milk equivalent” (P < 0.01); between education and income level and “milk consumption” (P < 0.05). The socio-economic, demographic, and biological variables of the consumers should be carefully monitored in order to maintain and increase the demand for milk and dairy products, and marketing strategies should be created specifically to increase the breakfast habit.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44423/31626,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The study was conducted on a 1.5 ha area with well-established African star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). The area was divided into 18 paddocks of 400 m2. for three treatments and six replications that were assigned through a randomized block design. The treatments were: Nap1 =Single N application; Nap2= split into two N applications; and Nap4: split into four N applications. Fertilizer application was 200 kg ha-1 of N in topdressing. Pasture was monitored weekly by sward height. Grazing began when the forage reached between 25 and 30 cm in height and ceased at 10 cm. In almost all months evaluated, Nap1 recorded the highest forage production, daily accumulation rate and available forage mass. Some morphogenic characteristics changed between the fertilization strategies, particularly in the months with greater water availability. The chemical composition did not fluctuate between treatments. African star grass can be fertilized with a single application of nitrogen at 200 kg ha-1 to attain greater forage mass and proportion of leaves, without any changes to the chemical composition and nitrogen fractions. These components were modified by the vegetative phase of the forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43779/31628,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Risk factors associated with the occurrence of multiresistant Staphylococcus spp. isolated from bovine subclinical mastitis in northern Brazil,"Staphylococcus bacteria are often associated with subclinical bovine mastitis. This study aimed to identify multiresistant Staphylococcus spp. associated with subclinical mastitis and the associated risk factors. Twenty-three dairy farms with a history of decrease in milk production, located in the lower Acre region, Brazil, were selected. An epidemiological questionnaire was provided in all farms. All animals were examined using the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and their milk samples were collected for bacterial culture. After isolation and identification, the disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed against nine classes of antimicrobials. Of the 339 cows examined using the CMT, 108 had mastitis. A total of 229 milk samples were collected from individual teats. MALDI-TOF MS found isolates belonging to eight species of Staphylococcus, in 101 of these samples. S. chromogenes (58.4%) demonstrated strongest resistance to the nine classes of antimicrobial active principles. Nineteen isolates with multidrug resistance phenotypic profile were identified. This phenotypic expression indicates wide circulation of resistant genes in this species. The presence of multidrug resistance in Staphylococcus spp. in this study was correlated with lack of water for cleaning the corral, which is a preventive factor, minimizing the transmission and persistence of pathogens in the farms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44031/30848,E-ISSN 1679-0359

43,2022,Oral adenocarcinoma observed in Boa constrictor maintained in captivity,"Information on neoplasms in animals has increased over time, and these studies have helped in the management of reptiles that present tumors. There are similar incidences of neoplasms between homeothermic and ectothermic animals. Furthermore, there are usually more than one type of tumor present. The treatment of wild animals afflicted with cancer usually happens late, contributing to their low life expectancy. Thus, the present work aimed to describe an infrequent case of oral tumor in Boa constrictor. The tumor was observed in an adult female animal, raised in an exhibition area of the Zoo and Botanical Park of the Emílio Goeldi Museum, located in Belém, State of Pará, Brazil. Macroscopically, the mass presented morphologically with an irregular, multilobulated surface, color that varied from white to grey, hemorrhagic areas and its extension was 3.9 x 2.3 cm. The neoplasm was surgically removed, and the histopathological evaluation revealed an adenocarcinoma, with a papillary-like development pattern and a moderate degree of differentiation. The animal died three months after diagnosis due to starvation. The necropsy showed that there was tumor recrudescence and no metastases. Given the impossibility of surgical removal with a greater margin of safety, and adjuvant therapies, this condition favoured the resurgence of the neoplasm. This compromised the animal’s ability to feed and consequently lead to death. Malignant neoplasms in reptiles may have an unfavourable clinical evolution for the maintenance of life, requiring specific therapeutic care such as chemotherapy. Scientific contributions on tumors in these animals are essential for the medical treatment of wild animals, and the conservation of wild species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44084/30849,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Herein, we report a parasitism by Dipetalonema gracile Rudolphi, 1809 (Spirurida, Filarioidea, Onchocercidae), in the peritoneal cavity of a captive Marcgrave's capuchin monkey (Sapajus flavius) that died at the Wild Animal Screening Center (CETAS) of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) in the municipality of Cabedelo, state of Paraíba, northeastern Brazil. The necropsy revealed two filarial worms D. gracile in the abdominal cavity. Exudates, thin fibrin layers and fibrous adhesions were also present in the mesentery and spleen capsule. The mesenteric, mandibular, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were enlarged. Multiple small nodules were seen in the spleen parenchyma. Microscopic examination of the lymph nodes and spleen revealed markedly and diffuse inflammatory reaction, with edema, plasma cells, eosinophils, histiocytes, lymphocytes and rare multinuclear giant cells, with obliteration of the normal histological architecture of the organ. This is the first report of D. gracile parasitism in Marcgrave's capuchin monkeys, a critically endangered species.

43,2022,Effect of quercetin or butylated hydroxytoluene on cooled or frozen-thawed ram sperm quality,"Cooling and freezing processes cause physical and chemical damage to sperm by cold shock and oxidative stress. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two antioxidants on sperm parameters of cooled and frozen-thawed ram semen diluted in an egg yolk-based extender. Semen was collected from 30 rams and processed in two consecutive experiments to test the inclusion of different concentrations of quercetin and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in an egg yolk-based semen extender. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added as a solvent to the semen extender in a ratio of 1 mL DMSO for 90 mg of quercetin and 1 mL DMSO for 880 mg of BHT. After collection, semen was diluted at 200 × 106 motile sperm/mL (control) and split into different groups in each experiment. In experiment 1, semen was diluted with the extender containing quercetin (Q5, 5 µg/mL; Q10, 10 ug/mL; Q15, 15 ug/mL) or DMSO alone (DMSO1, 0.055 uL DMSO per mL; DMSO2, 0.165 uL DMSO per mL). In experiment 2, semen was diluted with the extender with BHT (BHT1, 0.5 ug/mL; BHT2, 1 ug/mL; BHT3, 1.5 ug/mL) or DMSO alone (DMSO3, 0.375 uL DMSO per mL; DMSO4, 1.125 uL DMSO per mL). After dilution, the semen was divided into two aliquots. Treated ram sperm samples were also subjected to different storage methods. The first set of samples was cooled at 5 °C for 24 h, whereas the second set of samples was frozen-thawed. Sperm motility parameters and plasma membrane integrity (PMI) were evaluated immediately after dilution (0h) and 24 h after cooling and in the frozen-thawed samples via computer-assisted sperm analysis and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively. The inclusion of quercetin or BHT did not affect sperm motility parameters or PMI of fresh, cooled, or frozen-thawed sperm in this study (P < 0.05).

However, the adoption of reduced row spacing only is possible with smaller plants, which may be obtained with the use of plant growth regulator. This study aimed to evaluate the agronomic performance of the first corn crop with Trinexapac-ethyl applied at the different plant development stages and grown under different row spacing, with the same plant population. The experiments were arranged in a split-plot randomized block design with four replications, with row spacing for the plots (0.45 and 0.90 m) and Trinexapac-ethyl (TE) application time to subplots (control without application, at the V3, V6, V9 and V12 phenological stages). The Trinexapac-ethyl application time interacted with row spacings changing the growth and yield performance of the corn crop. For 0.45 m spacing Trinexapac-ethyl application at V12 and for 0.90 m spacing application at V9 and V12 reduced plant height and ear height. Trinexapac-ethyl application at V9 for both row spacings changed the plant architecture without changing the ear length and grain yield.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43121/30803,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study aimed to examine the administration of dipyrone by continuous infusion (CI) as an adjuvant analgesic in the intraoperative period for bitches undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy (OH) and its effect on these patients’ cardiorespiratory parameters. Twenty bitches underwent an elective OH procedure. The pre-anesthetic agent was a combination of acepromazine and morphine. Propofol was used to induce anesthesia, and isoflurane was used for maintenance. Subsequently, the animals were randomly allocated into two groups: the dipyrone group (DG) received a bolus dose of dipyrone (25 mg kg -1) by CI at a rate of 10 mg kg -1 h, and the control group (CG) received a bolus dose and a CI of 0.9% NaCl solution, both groups at a rate of 5 mL kg -1 h. The parametric variables were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The paired t-test (p < 0.05) was used for comparison between the groups. Statistical differences were observed for heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and blood glucose between the periods in both groups. There were differences only in the basal values of MAP between the groups; however, most values remained within the physiological range for the species. Using the drug as an adjuvant to anesthesia did not alter cardiorespiratory parameters, and it can be used as an adjuvant in analgesia during the intraoperative period of OH.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43742/30802,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Propolis in the control of bacterial bovine mastitis: a tool for the production of organic milk,"Bovine mastitis is one of the main causes of economic damage in dairy farms. Therefore, the control and prevention of microorganisms involved in this disease, mainly Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, are essential. One of the most important steps for the prevention of the disease is the use of antiseptic products before and after the milking process to avoid bacteria from infecting the udder of the animal. Currently, the most used antiseptic product in dairy farms is iodine-based, and organic dairy farms, which follow several strict regulations, including the use of natural products whenever possible, are often forced to adopt non-natural antiseptic products, such as iodine-based ones, because of the lack of natural alternatives. Propolis, a natural substance produced by honeybees, has been extensively studied for its various properties, one of which is antimicrobial activity. Therefore, a new natural antiseptic product containing 1% propolis in 10% hydroalcoholic solution for the pre-dipping, and 10% glycerol solution added with 0.2% citronella oil for the post-dipping was analyzed for its capacity to reduce bacteria in vivo in order to prevent bovine mastitis, allowing its use on organic dairy farms. A total of 128 samples were analyzed in terms of bacterial growth for Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. using the spread-plate technique. The reduction in the bacterial concentration after the application of the products was compared between two antiseptic solutions, an iodine-based solution as the control and a propolis-based one as the natural alternative. The results obtained show a similar efficiency for both products in terms of total bacterial reduction, indicating considerable antimicrobial activity against bacteria most commonly associated with bovine mastitis. Molecular analysis was carried out for the identification of Streptococcus agalactiae; the PCR results were negative for the presence of S. agalactiae in all samples, indicating that the animals most likely did not have any form of the disease. The efficiency of the natural antiseptic was satisfactory, indicating an important find facilitating organic milk production worldwide, showcasing a natural antiseptic solution with efficient antimicrobial activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44101/30823,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Biomorphometry of Automeris liberia Cramer (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) in oil palm in the Amazon,"Automeris liberia Cramer are found in South America, with documented sightings in Ecuador, Peru, some regions of Mexico and, more recently, the Brazilian Amazon. These moths cause damage to several plant species. We designed an experiment to study the biology and morphometry of A. liberia in the laboratory and provide information for the management of the pest in oil palm cultivation in the Brazilian Amazon. Caterpillars for rearing were collected from commercial areas of oil palm cultivation, where they cause defoliation of the plant. They were fed a natural diet of oil palm leaves of the Tenera variety and observed from second generation onwards. Sex, behavior, posture, mass, body length, wingspan, body diameter, sex ratio, average growth ratio, and antenna were quantified. The embryonic stage lasted 14 days, followed by seven larval instar stages over 36 days. The pupal stage lasted 21 days. Adults had a longevity of 4.5 and 6 days and a total biological cycle of 78.5 and 80 days, for males and females, respectively. The growth ratio was 1.49. The antennae showed sexual dimorphism, with bipectinate morphology in males and filiform in females. In the adult stage, morphological variables were evaluated (body length, thoracic diameter, wingspan, forewing length, forewing height, hindwing length, hindwing height, antenna length, number of antennomeres, and body mass), and they showed significant differences between males and females (Newman-Keuls test, P < 0.05).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40797/30776,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Forage sorghum production under rainfed farming in sites with and without climate restriction for maize cultivation,"Forage sorghum is a crop that can be planted in semiarid regions, due to its greater adaptability to dry climate environments, and can replace maize in these regions, which are often unsuitable for its production. Thus, the objective of the study was to evaluate the structural, morphological and nutritional characteristics of 23 sorghum hybrids forage cultivated in rainfed conditions, planted in different climate conditions, comparing the hybrids, in order to determine what produces the best in the climatic conditions of the explored region, and also to indicate whether this crop can be planted as a replacement for maize in environments not suitable for planting it. The research was conducted in climate BSh in the Municipality of Alvorada do Gurgueia, and climate Aw in the Municipality of Bom Jesus, both in the state of Piauí from 2014 to 2015. Each trial consisted of 20 experimental forage sorghum hybrids [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and three commercial hybrids. A randomized block design was used, with three replications in a factorial scheme (2 × 23). The growth characteristics determined were hybrid × climate interaction for the variables plant height, lodging and leaf/stem ratio. For the variable number of tillers, there was a significant difference only between hybrids. There was no difference between hybrids only for the lodging variable of climate Aw. The other variables showed a difference in all hybrids evaluated. There was an interaction for production of dead matter and total dry forage mass between the different environments and hybrids evaluated. For leaf production, there was an effect only for the different environments. For the chemical characteristics, there was an interaction for all variables analyzed between the different environments and hybrids evaluated. The semi-arid region of the State of Piauí, climate BSh which presents a high climatic risk for maize cultivation, proved to be favorable for forage sorghum production. The forage sorghum also presented agronomic characteristics similar to those found in semi humid climate Aw, a favorable region for maize cultivation. In addition, the tested hybrids showed good chemical characteristics, so the BSh climate has great exploratory potential for the cultivation of forage sorghum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44409/30774,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Physiology in Talisia esculenta seedlings under irrigation with saline water on substrate with hydrogel,"Salinity interferes in the physiology of seedlings from germination and seedling emergence, so it is necessary to adopt measures to mitigate its effects. The objectives of this research were to evaluate irrigation frequency, saline water, polymer, and container volume in the emergence and physiology of Talisia esculenta (A. St.-Hil.) Radlk. The treatments were obtained from the combination of polymer doses (0.0; 0.2; 0.6; 1.0; and 1.2 g dm-3), electrical conductivities of the irrigation water (0.3; 1, 1; 2.7; 4.3; and 5.0 dS m-1), and irrigation frequencies (daily and alternate), plus two additional treatments to assess the volume of the container. A randomized block design was used. Emergence and leaf indices of chlorophyll, fluorescence, and gas exchange were analyzed 100 days after sowing. The increase in electrical conductivity reduced and delayed seedling emergence. Decreasing irrigation frequency reduced the chlorophyll b index, stomatal conductance, transpiration, net CO2 assimilation, and carboxylation efficiency. The magnitude of the effects of electrical conductivity of water and polymer were associated with the frequency of irrigation. However, both salinity and polymer reduced practically all physiological variables. The reduction in container volume also affected the physiology of the seedlings, with more effects when irrigated on alternate days. The T. esculenta seedlings are considered sensitive to salinity, should be irrigated daily with water with less electrical conductivity than 1.0 dS m-1, as well as higher capacity containers used (0.75 vs 1.30 dm3).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44195/30770,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Potassium and growth-promoting fungi improve the postharvest quality of grape tomato,"Tomato plants respond well to potassium fertilization, whose insufficiency leads to a drop in fruit production and quality. On the other hand, the association of growth-promoting fungi (GPF) with roots has been shown to be able to optimize nutrient absorption, which implies lower financial costs and a decreased risk of loss of K applied to the soil. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of inoculation with GPF and K rates on the postharvest quality of grape tomato hybrid ‘Mascot’ grown in a hydroponic system. The plants were cultivated in a hydroponic drip system using washed and sterilized sand as substrate. They were trained with two stems, leaving three bunches per stem. The experiment was carried out in a split-split-plot arrangement in a completely randomized design with three replicates. Ripe fruits were stored for 30 days in PET containers in storage chambers at a temperature of 25 °C. After 0, 10, 20 and 30 days of storage, five fruits were collected to determine the titratable acidity (TA) and soluble solids (SS), reducing sugars (RS) and vitamin C contents. The K rates provided an increase in the quality attributes. At low K rates, inoculation with GPF led to higher TA, SS, RS and vitamin C values. Inoculation of the plants with GPF improved the postharvest preservation of the fruits, especially when the plants underwent nutritional stress during cultivation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41596/30736,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Risk factors associated with the presence of Mycobacterium bovis in macroscopic lesions suspected as being caused by bovine tuberculosis detected in slaughterhouses,"Mycobacterium bovis is a bacterium belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that causes tuberculosis in cattle and in other domestic and wild animals, as well as in humans. Disease control measures are carried out by slaughtering animals tested positive in the intradermal tuberculinization test and sanitation of their original living spaces, in addition to epidemiological surveillance carried out through the sanitary inspection of bovine carcasses in slaughterhouses. In the latter, official inspection services collect samples from macroscopic lesions suspected of bovine tuberculosis, which are then sent for laboratory analysis. Knowledge concerning the variables associated with the occurrence of M. bovis can aid in decision-making regarding control and disease eradication efforts. In this context, the aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for a positive M. bovis diagnosis in suspected bovine tuberculosis lesions obtained during epidemiological surveillance activities in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. A total of 105 suspicious lesions were analyzed using the Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (nested q-PCR) method, of which 14 (13.33%) tested positive for M. bovis. Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses indicated that the variable “animal slaughter” was the only risk factor presenting statistical significance associated with the diagnosis of M. bovis (p < 0.05), demonstrating that macroscopic lesions suspected as being caused by bovine tuberculosis from animals with an in vivo diagnosis were 2.82 - fold more likely to result in a positive M. bovis diagnosis by molecular tests.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44411/30744,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Biochemical, microbiological and technological characteristics of type II sourdoughs produced with lactic acid bacteria single-strains","The interplay between biochemical characteristics and the generation of volatile compounds in 11 type II sourdough fermented by single strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was studied. Samples were collected at 0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24h for analyses of microbial growth, pH, titratable acidity and CO2 production. During the first 12h, the LABs entered the stationary phase, and the formation of organic and carboxyl acids, alcohols, and esters were observed. Although acidity is an important characteristic of sourdough, in this work increasing the acetic acid content decreased yeast growth and the CO2 retention capacity of the doughs. The main carbohydrate consumed by autochthonous yeast was influenced by the LAB added (homo-or heterofermentative), as observed by correlation analysis. Maltose and glucose showed a strong and negative correlation with the yeast cell density in the dough fermented by homo and heterofermentative LAB, respectively. Moreover, LAB had an important effect on the aromatic profile, being the alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, organics acids and esters mainly groups characterized. Altogether, 100 different volatile compounds were identified; however, each dough had a different volatile profile. This study shows, for the first time, the influence of a single strain of LAB on the characteristics of type II sourdough.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44375/30735,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,ACCase inhibitor fractionation and glyphosate addition improve perennial sourgrass control,"Glyphosate-resistant sourgrass is difficult to control, particularly when perennial, and strategies that improve the control efficiency against this grass and preserve the useful life of graminicides are warranted. Therefore, the present study aimed to answer the following questions: (i) Does fractionating the doses of ACCase inhibitors improve the control of perennial sourgrass? (ii) Does alternating the chemical groups cyclohexanediones (DIMs) and aryloxyphenoxypropanoates (FOPs) improve the control of perennial sourgrass, and does the order of their application affect sourgrass control efficiency? (iii) Does the addition of glyphosate to ACCase inhibitors improve to the control of perennial sourgrass resistant to 5-enol-pyruvyl-shiquime-3-phosphate synthase inhibitors? Two field experiments (I and II) were performed in 2018 and repeated in 2019. In experiment I, the treatments included a single or fractional application clethodim + quizalofop-P-ethyl (216 + 108 g a.i. ha-1), clethodim (216 g a.i. ha-1), and quizalofop-P-tefuryl (108 g a.i. ha-1), applied in the order of clethodim followed by quizalofop-P-tefuryl and vice versa, as well as a control treatment. In experiment II, the treatments included a single or fractional application of clethodim + quizalofop-P-ethyl (216 + 108 g a.i. ha-1) and clethodim (108 g a.i. ha-1), isolated or associated with glyphosate, as well as a control treatment. In both experiments, the interval between the fractional applications was 7 days. Percentage of control, number of tillers per plant, and height of sourgrass plants were determined. Compared with the unfractionated application, the fractionation of clethodim + quizalofop-P-ethyl and clethodim increased control by respectively 20-24 and 25-30%. Fractionated clethodim has greate control, and less regrowth and height of the sourgrass plants. The order of application of the chemical groups FOPs and DIMs affected control efficiency, and better results were obtained with the application of quizalofop-P-tefuryl followed by clethodim. The addition of glyphosate potentiates the action of graminicides, particularly when fractionated, even on resistant sourgrass, with a 26% increase in efficiency and resulting in satisfactory control ( > 80%).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44596/30733,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Selectivity of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana to adults of Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae),"The selectivity of entomopathogenic fungi to non-target organisms needs to be considered in Integrated Pest Management (IPM), because even though they are biological control agents, if used incorrectly, they can negatively alter the functioning of agroecosystems. Therefore, studies that assess the selectivity of these fungi to beneficial organisms are extremely important. The objective of this work was to evaluate the selectivity of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metarril®) and Beauveria bassiana (Boveril®) to adults of Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), under laboratory conditions. The products were evaluated on adult females of T. podisi, at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. To this end, 0.2 mL of suspensions of each product and control (treatments) were applied to the inner surface of glass tubes, and then a female T. podisi was placed in it (bigger, smaller 48 h of emergence). After 24 h of contact, cards with 25 eggs of Euschistus heros Fabricius (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were offered for 24 h (COF24). After this period, the COF24 were withdrawn. After 72 h of contact of the female with the tube surface, new E. heros egg cards were made available (COF72) for 24 h for T. podisi ovipositioning. The evaluations were carried out on a daily basis and the parameters evaluated were female longevity, percentage of parasitism, percentage of emergence, sex ratio, and egg-adult period. Mortality of T. podisi females was evaluated daily to determine longevity, percentage of parasitism and emergence, sex ratio, and egg-adult period. Metarril® and Boveril®, considered selective for adult females of T. podisi, did not negatively affect most of the parameters evaluated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43840/30764,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Antibody frequency for Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora spp. in domiciliated and stray cats from Araguaína, Tocantins, Eastern Amazonia","Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora spp. are protozoa that have a significant impact on animal health due to the diseases they cause in domestic and wild animals. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of antibodies against T. gondii and Neospora spp. in cats from northern Brazil. Serum samples were collected from 180 cats in the municipality of Araguaína, Tocantins and used to evaluate the presence of anti-T. gondii and anti-Neospora spp. antibodies using the indirect fluorescent antibody test, with a cutoff of 1:64 and 1:25, respectively. The association between infection and individual animal characteristics (age, sex, origin, breed, and clinical signs) was tested using univariate analysis, followed by multivariate logistic regression. We found that 48.3% (87/180) of the animals had anti-T. gondii (95% CI: 40.8%–55.90%) and 3.9% (7/180) had anti-Neospora spp. (95% CI: 1.6%–7.8%) antibodies. There was no association between age, sex, breed origin, clinical signs, and seropositivity for T. gondii. Cats of defined breeds were more likely to be infected by Neospora spp. (OR = 10.7). Therefore, we found a high rate of seropositivity for T. gondii and a high rate of occurrence of Neospora infections in cats from the Araguaína region. The exposure of the feline population to the studied coccidia indicates the need to monitor the feline population for these infections and underscores the importance of effective sanitary measures against such pathogens.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43887/30694,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Phytochemical screening, toxicity and antimicrobial activity of different Mimosa tenuiflora extracts on Aeromonas strains","The indiscriminate use of synthetic veterinary drugs in fish farms for disease control has caused recurring environmental pollution and reduced productivity; however, the search for ecologically viable alternatives is increasing. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical characterization of the hexanic, methanolic, and aqueous extracts of black jurema (M. tenuiflora), and their antimicrobial activity against strains of Aeromonas, and acute toxicity (LC50) to fingerlings of O. niloticus. The isolates were identified, and phenotypic virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed. A. caviae, and A. veronii bv. veronii showed 75.0 - 87.5% positivity for the virulence factors tested, and resistance to the antimicrobials ampicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline of 67.0% and 50.0%, respectively. Phytochemical screening of black jurema extracts detected phenols, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, and steroids/triterpenoids, with methanol proving to be more efficient in the extraction of metabolites. The methanolic and aqueous extracts showed moderate antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of 250 ug mL-1, and the methanolic extract revealed an LC50 of 40 ug mL-1 for O. niloticus. This study demonstrated the efficiency of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of M. tenuiflora extracts, and their use in vivo in the treatment or prophylaxis in fish farming can be investigated to replace the use of synthetic antimicrobials.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43018/30695,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Selenium supplementation levels and sources in post-larvae Nile tilapia diet,"Fish larviculture exert great influence in the subsequent phases, in which nutrition is a basic prerequisite for success. Therefore, when it is in an intensified production system, it promotes the limitation of some minerals, making it necessary to supplement selenium in diets for post-larvae. The objective of this study was to evaluate selenium levels and sources in post-larvae Nile tilapia diets on muscle performance and histology. A total of 1,260 post-larvae with an initial average weight of 0.010 g were used, distributed in a completely randomized design in a factorial scheme with four supplementation levels (0.6; 0.9; 1.2 and 1.5 mg of Se/Kg) and two sources (sodium selenite and selenium yeast), plus the negative control, with 35 post-larvae Nile tilapia used per experimental unit. The physical-chemical parameters of water quality were within those recommended for tilapia cultivation. Feed consumption (p < 0.05) and hepatosomatic index (p < 0.05) were affected by the source used. Effects of supplemented selenium levels and sources were not observed for the other performance variables. Higher values for final height, final width, specific development rate and protein efficiency rate were found (p < 0.05) when comparing the control diet with diets containing the sodium selenite source. No effects on muscle fiber morphometry were observed (p > 0.05) in the studied variables.

43,2022,In vitro and in vivo parameters for identification of landrace pigs with low reproductive performance,"In pig farming, measurements of production parameters play a fundamental role in the success of the activity. Minimal differences in fertility between breeders can lead to less reproductive efficiency and, less productivity. However, assessing the fertility of each male and the early identification of subfertile males is a difficult task to be performed. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of in vitro and in vivo parameters in the identification of subfertile males of the Landrace breed, aiming to collaborate with genetic improvement programs, routine optimization in the Genetic Diffusion Units (GDUs) and the results of performance. In experiment 1, an approach to identify males with subfertility was evaluated based on retrospective data. For this, the results (averages of birth rates, number of total births and average percentages of female and male piglets per litter) were evaluated for a total of 996 matings and 847 parturitions. The inseminations came from ejaculates of 32 males, who had at least 19 females inseminated with homospermic doses in the concentration of 2.5 x 109 total sperm from the same male. As for the birth rate (BR), an average of 85.47% ± 6.05 was observed with a group of median males, seven males that stood out and one individual (M32) with a performance of 58.06% ± 9.0. For the total number of piglets born (PB) the average was 13.41 ± 0.56, with three males with better performance and one (M32) with very poor performance (8.62 ± 0.59). In experiment 2, it was verified whether evaluations of inseminating doses (ID) of semen in vitro (motility and sperm morphology) after 96 hours of storage had correlations with fertility in vivo, which can be used to identify subfertile males. The evaluations were performed on 30 ejaculates regarding the means of BR and PB, considering only those who had at least 7 females inseminated. There were no correlations between the motility assessments and semen morphological changes and the reproductive parameters evaluated. The results obtained in vivo, referring to BR and PB, demonstrated that it was possible to identify differences between males, the individual (M32) had the worst results for the percentages of BR and PB. It is concluded that there are males of high and low fertility and that only the in vitro analyzes carried out in this study are not enough to categorize them, however, the evaluation of retrospective data was efficient for this purpose.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43997/30687,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Identification of the contaminating psychrotrophic bacteria in refrigerated bulked raw milk and the assessment of their deteriorating potential,"This work aimed to characterize, identify, and determine the deteriorating potential of the contaminating psychrotrophic bacteria in refrigerated raw milk. Samples were submitted to serial dilutions and plated in specific culture media to form a bacterial culture collection. The isolates were characterized for their morphology and biochemical characteristics. The deteriorating potential of the isolates was determined according to the proteolytic, lipolytic and lecithinase activities at 4.0 ºC, 6.5 ºC, and 25.0 ºC. The results obtained for deterioration potential were assessed by the multivariate statistical method and by the principal components analysis (PCA). A total of 159 isolates were characterized, and of these, 46 strongly proteolytic Gram-negative isolates were selected for identification using the API 20 NE kit. The predominant bacteria were Gram-negative and oxidase and catalase positive, with a predominance of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Using PCA, it was shown that the bacteria with the greatest deterioration potential were lecithinase producers, and that, in the autumn, proteolytic bacteria predominated at 4.0 ºC. Of the 46 isolates identified, more than 80% belonged to the species Pseudomonas fluorescens. Thus, attention should be given to the importance of implementing microbial contamination prevention measures in the bulking process, since, even under refrigeration, psychrotrophic bacteria multiply and produce enzymes that deteriorate lipids and proteins, with consequent quality losses of the milk and its derivatives, yield losses in the production of dairy products, and economic losses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44325/30753,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Evaluation of fecal smear methods for research on Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in the feces of dairy calves,"The objective of this study is to compare the direct fecal smear (DFS) and centrifugal sedimentation (CS) methods in the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in fecal samples of dairy calves. One hundred and fourteen fecal samples were collected from calves aged up to six months from 10 dairy farms located in Palotina and Francisco Alves, Paraná, Brazil. The microscopic analysis revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in 51.75% (59/114) of the samples in both methods. In CS, 48.25% (55/114) of the samples were positive, while in DFS slides, only 6.14% (7/114) were positive. Only 4 samples were positive exclusively in DFS. To ensure that there were no false-negative results in the microscopic analysis, the 55 samples that were negative in both DFS and CS were selected for molecular analysis using the nested PCR (nPCR). Of these 55 samples, 24% (13/55) were positive and forwarded for sequencing part of the genome, which made it possible to identify C. parvum, C. bovis and C. ryanae. Besides the characterization of the Cryptosporidium species, it was possible to identify bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter interfering directly in the analyzed samples. The microscopic analysis also revealed higher sensitivity when CS was used to make the fecal smears. However, some samples that were negative in this technique had positive PCR results. Thus, molecular analysis is indicated to confirm cases of Cryptosporidium spp. Further studies are necessary to prove the specificities of the used primers since the results obtained in nPCR were positive for the protozoan but, when genetic sequencing was performed, Acinetobacter spp. was identified.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43744/30688,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The birds were distributed in a com-pletely randomized design, 2x4 factorial arrangement, 2 temperatures (24 and 32 ºC) and 4 levels of magnesium in the water (50, 150, 250 and 350 mg L-1), with six replicates and eight birds per experi-mental unit. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means compared by the Tukey test at 5% probability level. The magnesium levels in the water did not affect (P > 0.05) the production performance and morphometry of the organs, with less water consumption at the magnesium level of 150 mg L-1, and birds kept at 32 °C had a reduction in feed consumption and feed conversion, but without affecting organ morphometry. Japanese quails in the production phase can consume water with magnesium levels up to 350 mg L-1 without having their production performance and morphome-try of organs affected and raised in an environment with temperatures of up to 32 °C.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44081/30689,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Therefore, the present study aimed to verify if there is a synergistic effect in the combined use of enzymes carbohydrates and essential oils on the performance, ingestive behavior and carcass traits of steers fed a high-energy diet. During the finishing period of 78 days, 40 steers were assigned to four treatments: CON- control; ENZ- enzymatic complex; EO- essential oil blend; ENZ+EO - enzymatic complex combined with essential oil blend. Regardless of the feedlot periods, the ENZ+EO treatment caused a reduction in the dry matter intake (12.48%) compared to the control. The ENZ+EO treatment resulted in the lowest mean fecal output and, consequently, the highest dry matter digestibility (DMD) and starch digestibility (SD), compared to the other treatments. Animals that received EO and ENZ+EO in the diet spent more time in feeding. As for the number of times animals visited the feeding trough, the highest values were presented by the animals in the EO, ENZ and ENZ+EO treatments. For the carcass parameters, only the subcutaneous fat thickness on the rib was significantly different between treatments, with the highest values obtained by adding EO and ENZ+EO (8.80 and 8.10 mm respectively). Thus, the combination of carbohydrate enzymes and essential oils proved to be synergistically beneficial in relation to better use of nutrients and productive performance of feedlot steers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43774/30738,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Patterns of production and sustainability of cattle ranching in the state of Pará - Brazilian Amazon,"The aim of this study was to analyze the production patterns present in rural properties producing cattle in the micro-regions that make up the state of Pará. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was applied to identify the patterns, and these data are used to evaluate correlation between the heterogeneity of rural properties and the environmental impact on the identified patterns. The theoretical contribution is based on discussions on global impacts of food production and environmental sustainability and the impacts of livestock production systems in Brazil and the Amazon. Survey data were taken from the 2017 Agricultural Census, available for the 144 municipalities in the state, and pooled into 22 micro-regions. Three patterns of rural properties were identified: the first related to conservation management practices and called transition management; the second highlights aspects associated with information technology and communication (ICT) and productivity called technical productive efficiency; the third indicates the importance of social organization and access to information called social participation. With these patterns, it was possible to develop the Traditional Performance Indicator (TPI), in which the micro-regions of São Félix do Xingu, Itaituba and Conceição do Araguaia were those with the highest values of this indicator, water protection practices are present in the properties, however, in precarious conditions, and conservation practices are rarely used. The correlation between heterogeneity, measured by the size of pasture area in each micro-region, and the TPI is positive, strong and significant. In this transition context, public policies are essential to provide access to infrastructure, credit and good animal health and biotechnology practices.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43164/30685,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Suitability of tetrazolium test for Tamarindus indica L. seeds,"Seed quality is routinely assessed by direct tests, e.g, the germination test, or indirect tests like the tetrazolium test, which has shoown to be promising in the determine viability and vigor, allowing the diagnosis of the main problems that may affect seed quality, such as mechanic damages, field deterioration and storage. In this respect, this study was conducted to develop a tetrazolium test protocol to evaluate the viability and vigor of Tamarindus indica L. seeds. Before exposing the seeds to the tetrazolium solution, seed preconditioning studies were carried out in which seven soaking times were tested. The soaking time that did not cause damage to the seed embryo and allowed the removal of the seed coat to expose the seed structures to the tetrazolium salt was selected. Then, an experiment was set up in a completely randomized design with a 2x3x3 factorial arrangement involving two seed lots, three soaking times in tetrazolium salt (6, 12 and 16 h) and three salt concentrations (0.075, 0.1 and 0.5%), totaling 18 treatments with four replicates of 25 seeds, evaluated at 40 ºC. For each treatment, the seeds were divided into three classes, namely, viable and vigorous embryos (class 1); viable embryos (class 2) and non-viable or dead embryos (class 3). For a comparison with the tetrazolium test results, the two seed lots were analyzed for water content, germination, emergence, first count, germination speed index, emergence speed index, growth and seedling dry weight. The viability and vigor of T. indica seeds can be evaluated after a soaking period of 48 h and immersion for 6h in tetrazolium salt at the concentration of 0.1%, at 40°C, with provides results similar to conventional seed viability tests. The tetrazolium test proved to be adequate to differentiate T. indica seed lots in terms of viability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44051/30683,E-ISSN 1679-0359

43,2022,"Performance, carcass characteristics, and health parameters of growing and finishing pigs fed with diets supplemented with isoquinoline alkaloids and essential oils","The goal of this study was to evaluate, in a commercial herd, the use of isoquinoline alkaloids and carvacrol versus a preventive antibiotic program, such as feed additives, on the performance, carcass traits, and health status of pigs in the growing and finishing phase. There were 576 PIC immunocastrated males and females, at 70 days of age and 28.429 ± 2.302 kg of initial weight used. The experimental design was a 4 × 2 factorial randomized block, with four preventive programs, two sexes, and six repetitions per treatment (the pen with 12 animals of the same sex was the replicate). The treatments were T1 (positive control program with antibiotic shocks at preventive level), T2 (negative control with the absence of antibiotics as a growth promoter or as preventive), T3 (isoquinoline alkaloids at 100 to 150 g ton-1), T4 (isoquinoline alkaloids at 90 g ton-1 + carvacrol essential oil at 1 kg ton-1). T1 and T3 presented higher daily feed intakes, followed by T2, and T4 showed the worst feed consumption (P < 0.05). T1 showed higher daily weight gain compared to T4 (P < 0.05), without differences between T2 and T3. T2 showed better feed conversion than T1 and T3, but it was similar to T4. There were no effects of the treatments on the carcass traits. Intestinal crypt hyperplasia and crypt abscesses (lesions caused by Lawsonia intracellularis) were significantly higher for T2 and T3 compared to T1, which was similar to T4. T2 presented the highest carcass condemnation at slaughter (7%), differing (P < 0.05) from T1, T3, and T4 (1, 2, and 3%, respectively). Isoquinoline alkaloids are an alternative for antibiotic-free diets for pigs in the growing and finishing phase, preserving the performance and carcass indices and minimizing sanitary carcass condemnations at the slaughterhouse.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/45088/31767,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Tuberculosis in bovine slaughtered in the semi-arid region of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil","Between November 2017 and August 2018, in order to determine the occurrence of tuberculosis in cattle slaughtered in the semi-arid region of Rio Grande do Norte, 11,610 bovine carcasses underwent a routine post-mortem inspection. One animal presented suggestive lesions and samples from lung, spleen and heart were submitted to microbiological culture in Stonebrink medium for 90 days and molecular analysis by nested-PCR. For histopathological examination and Ziehl Neelsen staining, the omentum was used. In the cultured samples, two of them (heart and spleen) showed growth, but were not confirmed as M. bovis by conventional PCR. At nested-PCR, the samples showed amplification for the TbD1 region. The presence of numerous granulomas was detected in the histopathological examination characterized by a necrotic center and areas of mineralization, as well as the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Microbiological culture can show false negative results, despite being considered a gold standard technique, although it takes time. Nested-PCR and histopathology show fast and effective results for the diagnosis of the disease. The presence of positive animals represents a public health risk in the studied region. Therefore, one of the essential systems applied to the control of bovine tuberculosis is the epidemiological surveillance of animals in slaughterhouses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41613/29932,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Modeling of soil loss by water erosion in the Tietê River Hydrographic Basin, São Paulo, Brazil","Since the mid-16th century, the Tietê River has been an important route for the territorial occupation and exploitation of natural resources in the interior of São Paulo and Brazil. Currently, the Tietê River is well known for environmental problems related to water pollution and contamination. However, little attention has been focused on water erosion, which is a serious issue that affects the soils and waters of the hydrographic basin. Thus, this work aimed to estimate soil loss caused by water erosion in this basin, which has an area of approximately 72,000 km², using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The RUSLE parameter survey and soil loss calculation were performed using geoprocessing techniques. The RUSLE estimated an average soil loss of 8.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and revealed that 18% of the basin's territory presents high erosion rates. These are priority zones for conservation practices to reduce water erosion and ensure long-term soil sustainability. The estimated sediment transport was 1.3 Mg ha-1 yr-1, whereas the observed sedimentation, which was calculated based on data from the fluviometric station, was 0.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Thus, the results were equivalent considering the large size of the study area and can be used to assist in managing the basin. Estimating soil losses can help in the planning of sustainable management of the Tietê River Hydrographic Basin and highlights the importance of minimizing water erosion, thus helping to prevent additional pollution and contamination with sediments, agrochemicals, and fertilizers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44503/31761,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Broiler feed formulated with phosphorus, calcium, and energy deficiencies supplemented with exogenous enzymes","Three experiments were carried out to verify the effects of the enzyme phytase, alone or combined with an enzyme complex, in diets deficient in available phosphorus (AP), calcium (Ca), and metabolizable energy (ME) on broiler performance, ME, and dietary amino acid digestibility. A total of 1,538 male Cobb 500 broilers were allocated to the three experiments, each of which consisted of five treatments: positive control (PC; basal ration); negative control 1 (NC1; PC minus 0.15% of AP, 0.16% of Ca, and 68 kcal kg-1 ME); negative control 2 (NC2; PC minus 0.15% of AP, 0.16% of Ca, and 101 kcal kg-1 of ME); NC1 plus phytase; and NC2 plus phytase plus enzymatic complex. Body weight gain (WG) and feed intake were measured from 1-21 days and from 1-42 days, and the corrected feed conversion rate (FCR) for mortality was calculated. In the second and third experiments, the apparent ME corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn) and standardized digestibility of amino acids, respectively, were determined, for the diets supplemented with phytase and the enzymatic complex. In the first experiment, enzyme supplementation increased (p < 0.05) WG at 21 days and 42 days relative to the negative controls. Phytase inclusion improved (p < 0.05) FCR at the initial phase compared to the NC1 diet. In the second experiment, enzyme supplementation did not affect (p > 0.05) AMEn. In the third experiment, both enzyme treatments improved (p < 0.05) the digestibility of amino acids in the supplemented diets compared to the deficient diets. Supplementation with phytase and carbohydrases preserves the performance of broilers fed diets deficient in AP, Ca, and ME and improves amino acid digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42762/29931,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Xylanases in diets with alternative feeds and energy reduction in commercial layers,"The use of alternative ingredients has been increasing in a continuing attempt to reduce production costs, along with the use of additives, such as carbohydrates, for their possible positive effects on nutrient metabolization by layers. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different xylanases in diets with reduced metabolizable energy (ME) and the inclusion of alternative ingredients on the metabolizability of nutrients in diets for commercial laying hens, by conducting two metabolism tests. In the first trial,100 layers hens were distributed in a fully randomized 2 × 2+1 factorial design (two metabolizable energy reductions × two xylanases, plus one control diet). In the second assay,140layer hens were distributed in a fully randomized 2 × 3+2 factor design (two xylanases× three ingredients, plus two control diets, positive and negative). It was concluded that supplementation with pantanal xylanase improved the metabolizability of nutrients in corn-based diets and soybean meal for light commercial layers, allowing for a reduction of up to 200 kcal/kg of ME in the diets. Xylanases are more effective on wheat bran enabling a decrease of 150 kcal/kg of ME in commercial laying diets without affecting nutrient metabolizability. The action of pantanal xylanase in diets containing fibrous ingredients was similar to that of commercial xylanase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42054/29965,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Respiratory profile and gill histopathology of Carassius auratus exposed to different salinity concentrations,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the chronic salinity tolerance of Carassius auratus and the effects on blood parameters, gill morphology, and survival. In the first test, nine different concentrations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, and 25 g L-1) of NaCl were used with nine repetitions for 96 h. The survival of fish subjected to 15 g L-1 NaCl was 4 h, and 5 min at a concentration of 25 g L-1. The mortality of fish with 15 g L-1 NaCl was 100%. Morphological analyses of the gills showed hyperplasia of the coated cells in the interlamellar space and hypersecretion of mucus in fish exposed to 10 g L-1 of NaCl. At concentrations of 20 and 25 g L-1, necrosis of the support collagen caused the cells to detach from the lamellar structure mucosa. In the chronic test, two concentrations were used, with four replications containing nine fish in each aquarium for a period of 21 days. Blood samples and gills from the fish were collected, and it was observed that the fish showed a decrease in the concentration of bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the blood, indicating hypernatremia. Acute exposure of C. auratus to sodium chloride (NaCl) should be at a maximum of 10 g L-1 of NaCl, after which level there would be a loss in animal performance and/or mortality. Chronic exposure to 5 g L-1 of NaCl promotes acidemia, ionic imbalance, and pathological changes in the gills; therefore, it is not recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41949/29964,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Use of glycosaminoglycans from Oreochromis niloticus skin as an antioxidant supplement for milt cryopreservation of Brazilian bocachico,"The study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant action of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from the skin of Oreochromis niloticus, and to determine their ideal concentration to supplement the sperm freezing medium of Prochilodus brevis. In experiment 1, the in vitro antioxidant properties of GAGs were verified through the analysis of DPPH, chelating ferrous ability, and total antioxidant capacity. In experiment 2, milt pools were formed, which were frozen in solution supplemented or not with different GAGs concentrations: 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0 mg mL-1 (total of 10 treatments). The samples were evaluated for membrane integrity, DNA integrity, sperm morphology, and sperm kinetics. The results of experiment 1 showed that the GAGs exhibited, with the increase of the concentration, significant antioxidant action, for all the evaluated tests, mainly in the chelating ferrous ability. In experiment 2, it was observed that the increase of GAGs concentration decreased kinetic parameters (P < 0.05), however, the control and 0.5 mg mL-1 GAGs concentration showed similar results. For the other parameters (membrane integrity, DNA integrity, and sperm morphology), there was no decrease in results with the increase of GAGs concentration. In conclusion, GAGs extracted from O. niloticus skin have antioxidant action, and the concentration of 0.5 mg mL-1 was the most adequate to supplement the P. brevis sperm-freezing medium.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41826/29962,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Forage characteristics and beef cattle production in perennial pastures of BRS Paiaguás and BRS Piatã in integrated crop livestock system,"The integrated crop-livestock system is highlighted in Brazilian agriculture, in which the synergism between the components can increase productivity and animal performance. Forage is one of the most important components because it is the basis of animal feed. Thus, the objective of the study was to evaluate the beef cattle production and pastures characteristics of Urochloa brizantha ‘BRS Piatã’ and ‘BRS Paiaguás’, under continuous grazing in an integrated crop livestock system. The experiment was conducted in west of Sao Paulo State, in a randomized complete block design with two treatments and three replicates, from October 2018 to June 2019. The treatments were 3-year-old pastures of BRS Piatã and Paiaguás, in an integrated crop livestock system with perennial pasture and soybean. Nellore steers (14 ± 2 months old and 244 ± 13 kg initial weight) were used. The grazing method adopted was a continuous stocking with a variable rate to maintain a pasture height of 30 cm. Herbage mass was 5716 and 5480 kg dry matter ha-1 for Piatã and Paiaguás, respectively. The crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were similar between the two cultivars. The leaf blade mass of BRS Piatã was greater than that of BRS Paiaguás in summer. Animal performance was similar between treatments, with average daily gain of 0.901 and 0.822 kg day-1 and weight gain per area of 888 and 865 kg ha-1 in Piatã and Paiaguás, respectively. The BRS Piatã and BRS Paiaguás grasses are indicated for use in perennial pastures in integrated crop livestock systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41912/29928,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Cox-Gompertz model for analysis of the time of stay in an Anglo-Nubian goat herd,"Anglo-Nubian goats are hardy animals able to adapt to tropical environments, where their farming is usually held on pasture. However, climatic conditions in this environment also favor endoparasitism, which implies a negative aspect if sensitivity to worm infections interferes by reducing the reproductive lifespan of females, as their stay in the herd is a trait of great importance for efficient goat farming. In this respect, this study proposes to use the survival analysis methodology with the Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model to assess the length of stay in the herd by relating the removal of females due to death with worm infection being the main cause to other forms of culling, using information from 101 Anglo-Nubian goats born from 2009 to 2013 in an experimental herd from Teresina - PI, Brazil. The Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model chose body condition score, birth weight and birth season as important covariates (p-value bigger smaller 10%). Body condition score showed to be a favorable factor for the longer stay of the goats in the herd. Eggs per gram, age at first kidding, birth type and dam age were not significant. The Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model is suitable for fitting the statistical model to estimate the length of stay in the herd, with censoring related to endoparasitism in Anglo-Nubian goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41593/29926,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Influence of caprine arthritis encephalitis on milk production and quality along the lactation curve in primiparous dairy goats,"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) on the production of milk and its components (protein, fat and total solids) along the lactation curve of primiparous goats. The study was developed using a database from the years 2014 to 2018. Sixty-one animals were subjected to the serological test for CAE, whose result indicated that 42 were seropositive and 19 seronegative, and milk production and quality data were compiled. To adjust the curve for production of milk, fat, protein and total solids during lactation, the following nonlinear model developed by Wood (1967) was used: Y = atb e –ct, where Y represents the observations of milk, fat, protein or total solid production at time t; a is the parameter associated with the initial production; b is the parameter associated with the rate of rise in production until the peak; c is the parameter associated with the rate of decline of the lactation curve; and t is the representative time of the day in milk. The parameters were compared by the confidence interval considering 95% probability. Peak production was calculated using the following formula: A (b /c) be-b. There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between seropositive and seronegative primiparous goats for initial production and the rates of rise and decline of the parameters of milk, fat, protein and total solid production. However, at their peak, these variables were 26, 27, 23 and 23% higher, respectively, in the seronegative goats than in their seropositive counterparts. In conclusion, CAE does not affect milk production or the production of fat, protein and total solids along the lactation curve, but seropositive goats produce less milk and respective components at the peak of the lactation curve than seronegative goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41388/29925,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Use of different combinations of enzyme complexes in broiler diets,"Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of “on top” addition of different enzyme complexes, the enzyme alfa-galactosidase and three sources of the enzyme phytase available on the market, in broiler diets. In the first experiment, 1260 one-day-old Cobb 500R chicks were distributed into seven treatments in a completely randomized design (CRD) with six replicates and 30 birds/replicate. Treatments consisted of combinations of different enzyme complexes, namely, complex A (phytase, protease, xylanase, beta-glucanase, cellulase, amylase, pectinase), complex B (protease and cellulase) and complex C (xylanase, amylase and protease); isolated alfa-galactosidase (GAL); and three sources of phytase (P1, P2 and P3) in the diet. The treatments were formulated as follows: T1 - basal diet (BD); T2 - BD + enzyme complex A + enzyme complex B (BDAB); T3 - BDAB + GAL; T4 - BD + complex A + GAL; T5 - BD + complex C + P1 + GAL (BDCG); T6 - BDCG + P2; and T7 - BDCG + P3. The following variables were measured in the experimental period of 42 days: feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG), average final weight (AFW), feed conversion (FC), and carcass yield. Significant differences occurred for AFW, WG and FC in the pre-starter phase. In the second experiment, 112 Cobb 500R chicks aged 25 days were distributed into seven treatments in a CRD with four replicates and four birds/replicate. Treatments were the same as in the first experiment. Nutrient digestibility was evaluated in an experimental period of seven days. Differences were found in the metabolism coefficient of ether extract (MCEE). Dietary inclusion of enzyme complexes improves the AFW and WG of chickens from 1 to 7 days of age and MCEE in the grower phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40978/29924,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Effect of crushed sugarcane on performance, bone characteristics and intestinal morphology of free-range chicken lines","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of crushed sugarcane in the diet on the performance, bone characteristics and intestinal morphology of slow-growing broiler strains. A total of 448 chickens at 35 days of age were allotted to two randomized blocks in a 4×2 factorial arrangement (levels of feed replacement with crushed sugarcane, on a fresh-matter basis: 0, 15, 30, and 45%) and two strains (Pesadão and Label Rouge (LR)). Two replicates were used per block over time (containing the treatments and the strains), and 14 individuals were used per experimental unit. Weight gain and feed intake decreased linearly in response to the increasing sugarcane levels. Feed intake was higher in the Pesadão strain than in LR. Chicken foot weight was lower in Pesadão than in LR. There were no effects of sugarcane levels or strains on the tarsometatarsal bone weight, breaking strength, maximum load and deformation. The dry matter (DM) content of the tarsometatarsal bone was lower in LR than in Pesadão. The replacement of feed with sugarcane induced a linear increase in bone ash content and a decrease in bone phosphorus and calcium contents. Label Rouge chickens showed a greater crypt depth and lower values of villus/crypt ratio and mucosal layer thickness. The performance and intestinal morphology of broiler chickens are negatively affected by increasing sugarcane levels in the diet. In addition, the increasing intake of sugarcane changes the bone mineral composition without reducing mechanical resistance, in both the Pesadão and Label Rouge strains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40634/29988,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Management tools applied to milk quality in cattle farming in the Western Amazon,"This study aimed to analyze the applicability of management tools such as SWOT matrix, GUT matrix, Brainstorming, PDCA, Ishikawa diagram, and 5W2H in improving milk quality in rural properties for family labor. The survey was conducted in 18 properties in the municipality of Senador Guiomard, State of Acre, Brazil, during the period from January to December 2019. The properties were divided into two groups (treatment group-TG and control group-CG) and the data obtained through a form with 255 questions for diagnosis and analysis (LQL-GO) for somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) were tabulated in spreadsheets (Excel®) and subjected to statistical analysis by the Wilcoxon test. Nineteen weaknesses were obtained through the GUT matrix. The implementation of milking practices using tools obtained an average reduction of 31.4% for SCC and 63% for TBC in TG and a reduction of 39.3% for SCC and an increase of 33.7% for TBC in CG. Thus, the management tools applied to milk quality are capable of generating positive results (p < 0.05) in microbiological control, facilitating quick decision-making, aiming at the correction of weaknesses, and, consequently, an increase in profitability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42984/29921,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Efficiency of the anti-GnRH vaccine for castration of lambs intended for finishing in pastures,"It was aimed to evaluate anti-GnRH vaccine efficiency on productive characteristics, seminal performance, size, and histology of testicles of lambs submitted to immunocastration. Twenty contemporary Texel lambs were evaluated, being 10 animals received two doses of 1 mL of anti-GnRH vaccine and 10 received two doses of 1 mL of saline, with an interval of 30 days. Seminal characteristics, weight and histological cut for the testicles, productive performance, and blood parameters were analyzed. Andrological monitoring was carried out every 30 days. All animals were kept on pasture of Urochloa spp. receiving daily supplementation protein-energetic by 90 days. There was effect of immunocastration on slaughter weight (44.3 vs. 48.3 kg), total gain (9.9 vs. 10.3 kg), daily gain (104.5 vs. 108.9 g/day), and feed conversion (5.83 vs. 5.97) respectively to immunocastrated and intact lambs. There was immunocastration effect on testicle weight (0.09 vs. 0.35 g), motility (4.5 vs. 61.0%), vigor (0.40 vs. 3.00), volume (0.09 vs. 0.74 mL) and swirling (0.20 vs. 2.70) in the third semen collection.

42,2021,"Occurrence of Lawsonia intracellularis in horses raised in three regions of the state of Paraná, Brazil","Lawsonia intracellularis is a bacterium already described in several species and most prevalent in pigs, in which it causes enteric problems. Horses can also be affected, developing a disease known as equine proliferative enteropathy, which results from the proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in response to infection by the bacterium. Despite the existence of reports of the disease in several countries, including Brazil, there are still no reports of the disease or epidemiological studies of its occurrence in symptomatic or asymptomatic horses in the state of Paraná. Thus, the present study was conducted to examine the occurrence of L. intracellularis in asymptomatic horses raised in the west, northwest and north regions of Paraná by means of serological testing and the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique. In the serological approach, the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) technique was employed. Feces were processed and subjected to qPCR. In total, samples were collected from 162 animals from 20 farms. Of these, 9/162 (5.55%) showed specific antibodies against L. intracellularis. Real-time PCR, on the other hand, identified 7/162 (4.32%) fecal samples positive for the presence of the bacterium. When the techniques were compared, none of the samples was positive by both, demonstrating that, for a better diagnosis, they must be performed together. In contrast to most reports in horses, the present study describes higher serological and molecular occurrence in animals older than two years. These results are of great epidemiological relevance, as they indicate that the bacterium is present in the sampled regions of the state of Paraná. Therefore, the disease must be included in the differential diagnosis of diseases with similar clinical manifestations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42801/29961,E-ISSN 1679-0359

In birds, some pathogenic species of this genus causes a condition known as avian intestinal spirochetosis, which remains underdiagnosed, thereby causing serious economic losses. Brachyspira is a fastidious organism that necessitates the employment of fast and efficient identification techniques. The aim of this study was to identify Brachyspira spp. using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from the cecum of commercial poultry. Samples were collected from 129 birds aged between 35 and 45 days from commercial broiler farms. For evaluation, routine histology processing (H&E) and the histochemical technique, periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) were done. Additionally, FFPE tissue samples were evaluated for FISH and IHC. The histological lesions were analyzed and graded after H&E staining, and the goblet cells were counted and compared using PAS staining with the positive and negative samples obtained through FISH and IHC. For FISH, probes labeled with Brachyspira spp., B. pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, and B. intermedia were used, whereas rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Brachyspira spp. was used for IHC. Of 129 samples, 82 were positive with IHC and 86 were positive with FISH. The samples positive for the genus Brachyspira in the FISH technique were tested for B. pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, and B. intermedia in which 56 were positive for B. pilosicoli, 75 for B. hyodysenteriae and 80 for B. intermedia. There was an increase in goblet cells in the samples positive for FISH and IHC. The techniques used were effective and gave corresponding results, thus serving as a fast and efficient tool for diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40799/29913,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,FAMACHA©: Predictive value for control of Haemochus sp. in sheep from Brazilian Cerrado,"This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FAMACHA© method, correlating with packed cell volume (PCV) and egg count (FEC), as well as to evaluate the clinical signs of Haemonchus sp. infection in sheep from Brazilian Cerrado. Over two years (2017 to 2019), 1,435 sheep were subjected to clinical and parasitological evaluations. Sheep from six breeds (Santa Inês, Dorper, White Dorper, Ile de France, Suffolk, and crossbreed) were subdivided into five production categories (pregnant, lactating, non-pregnant/lactating ewes, breeding males, and weaned lambs). Parasitological evaluations included FEC and coproculture. In the clinical evaluation, all sheep underwent determination of the FAMACHA© score and PCV. Haemonchus sp. larvae were predominant in coprocultures of the flocks (76.4%) and in each animal production category evaluated (69.4 to 84.3%). FAMACHA© method showed high sensitivity (70.6%) for evaluating sheep with scores bigger smaleer 3, and PCV smaller 23%, and high specificity (97.5%) in animals with higher scores (4 and 5), and PCV smaller 18%. A negative correlation was observed between FAMACHA© scores and PCV (-0.46) and between PCV and FEC (-0.47), while a positive correlation was observed between FAMACHA© scores and FEC (0.22) (p bigger smaleer 0.01). The vast majority of the animals evaluated (54.5%) were clinically resistant to gastrointestinal parasites. Due to the high sensitivity and specificity, we concluded that the method could be a valuable diagnostic alternative and an auxiliary tool in the implementation of selective treatment for helminthic infection in sheep from Brazilian Cerrado.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42750/29914,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Increased antral follicle population and in vitro embryo production in pregnant Holstein,"This study used Holstein cattle to evaluate the following: I) the productive and reproductive characteristics of cows with low, intermediate and high antral follicle counts (AFCs) that were subjected to artificial insemination (AI) and comparison of AFC variability at the time of AI (nonpregnant) and at two time points during pregnancy (30 and 60 days), and II) whether the pregnancy status and different pregnancy periods in heifers improves the efficiency at in vitro embryo production (IVEP). In study I, 75 high-milk production cows with body condition scores (BCSs) of 2.75 to 4.75 and ages of 23 to 99 months were selected. On the day of estrus, AFCs (follicles bigger, smaller 3 mm), BCS, body weight, and diameters of the dominant follicle, ovaries and the corpus luteum were evaluated. Posteriorly, AFC was monitored in pregnant cows at 30 days (n = 35) and at 60 days for comparison of AFC before pregnancy versus different periods. In study II, heifers (n = 9) with BCS of 2.5 to 3.5 and ages of 10 to 16 months were selected for ovum pick-up and an IVEP program before AI (nonpregnant) as well as at 0 to 30, 31 to 60, and bigger 60 days of pregnancy. Statistical analysis was performed using PROC GLM and binary logistic regression model (P bigger, smaller 0.05). In study I, AFC was not associated with variations in productive and reproductive parameters. However, AFCs in the low group increased following pregnancy (AI: 14.82 ± 1.36, 30 days: 23.45 ± 2.31 and 60 days: 35.18 ± 3.17 follicles). AFCs increased from AI to 60 days in the intermediate group but did not vary among time points in the high group. AFCs varied among AFC groups in AI and at 30 days of pregnancy but not at 60 days. In study II, the mean of total oocytes (17.43 ± 4.52 vs. 41.67 ± 3.79) and viable oocytes (13.77 ± 3.63 vs. 30.56 ± 3.45) increased from AI (nonpregnant) to the first 30 days of pregnancy. The mean number of embryos produced increased during pregnancy and during the first 30 days of pregnancy (4.55 ± 0.75) compared to the nonpregnant period (1.39 ± 0.85). In conclusion, pregnancy positively influences AFC, and the greatest effect is noted in low count cows. In addition, the OPU at the time of pregnancy increased the efficiency of IVEP in heifers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42793/29922,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Human post exposure anti-rabies prophylactic assistance in the south of Brazil,"Rabies is a zoonosis caused by Lyssavirus, with progressive development and a high lethality rate. In Brazil, rabies and accidents caused by animals potentially transmitting the disease are mandatory notification injuries. Exposure to rabies infection places a high financial burden on public health systems, especially for the care of people who are exposed and have a high risk of death. We aimed to define the epidemiological profile of human rabies post-exposure assistance in the municipality of Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from 2010 to 2015. Data from Brazil's Notifiable Diseases Information System were obtained and analyzed; these data were acquired by the completion of individual inquiry forms querying human anti-rabies assistance. A total of 55% (1,898/3,453) of anti-rabies assistance cases involved women and 45% (1,555/3,453) men. The highest occurrence (54.5%–1,882/3,453) was in the age group of 20–59 years. Most registered cases (87.5%–3,024/3.453) were caused by dogs, followed by cats (10.9%–378/3,453). The lower limb (22.1%–617/2,790) was the area of the body with the highest number of canine bites. We observed incorrect indications for the treatment. We suggest further training for health professionals involved in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis care, and dissemination of information aimed at educating users about the importance of animal-related injuries.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40745/29912,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Yield performance of oat cultivars in response to sowing dates and densities,"Adjustment of seeding density oriented by genotype and conditions of the growing environment may favor growth, development and yield performance of the oat crop. This study aimed to evaluate the growth, lodging, yield components, and grain yield of oat cultivars grown at different sowing dates and densities. Two independent experiments were conducted at two sowing dates (May 5 and June 24) in Londrina-PR under a randomized block design in a 4 × 2 factorial scheme, with four replications. Treatments consisted of four sowing densities (180, 240, 300, and 360 viable seeds m-2) and two cultivars (IPR Afrodite and IPR Artemis). Plant height, number of panicles.m-2, number of spikelets per panicle, number of grains per spikelet, number of grains per panicle, thousand-grain weight, plant lodging, and grain yield were evaluated. The data were submitted to the analysis of joint variance for sowing dates, separately for the cultivars. The averages of sowing dates were compared by the F test and densities submitted to polynomial regression analysis up to 2nd degree, at 5% probability. The first sowing date favors most yield components and grain yield of the cultivars IPR Afrodite and IPR Artemis. In contrast, the number of panicles m-2 was reduced during this growing season for both cultivars. The late sowing date for the IPR Artemis cultivar resulted in a high percentage of lodging at all evaluated densities. However, this phenomenon is more intense at higher sowing densities during the first sowing date. Yield components and grain yield varied according to sowing dates and densities and the cultivar. The highest grain yield of the cultivar IPR Afrodite at the first sowing date was achieved with a lower sowing density than in the later date. However, the highest grain yield of the IPR Artemis cultivar was achieved at density of 280 viable seeds m-2, regardless of the growing season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42799/29959,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Optimizing the rate of phosphorus to enhance grain yield and quality in two Camelina sativa (L.) crantz accessions,"Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is an emerging oil seed crop and research information on its response to different levels of phosphorous (P) fertilizer is lacking. The two years study was performed to investigate the response of C. sativa to various rates of P fertilizer. The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement having four replications. The P was applied in soil at the rate of 0, 30, 40 and 60 kg ha-1 to two C. sativa accessions namely Canadian and Australian. Soil applied phosphorus rates had significant effects on the growth, yield and quality of C. sativa and two accessions were varied to each other. Australian accession performed better in terms of quality traits and Canadian was superior in terms of seed yield. An increase in P rate improved growth, yield and quality and 60 kg P ha-1 resulted in maximal crop growth rate (6.79), seed yield (1239 kg ha-1), total P uptake (0.67%) and oil contents (39.8%). The regression model estimated that each increment in P rate increased the seed yield by 11.5 and 11.2 kg ha-1 in Canadian and Australian accessions, respectively. Conclusively, increases in P rates (0 to 60 kg ha-1) impart a positive impact on C. sativa accessions and 60 kg P ha-1 was most effective to achieve optimum yield and profitability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42197/29958,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Genetic divergence based on leaf vegetative and anatomical traits of Coffea canephora clones,"Knowledge of the expression of traits associated with drought tolerance is important to mitigate impacts on coffee production in a climate change scenario. This study aimed to understand the genetic divergence between Coffea canephora genotypes grown in the Western Amazon based on leaf vegetative and anatomical traits. For this, fifteen high-performance genotypes were evaluated in a randomized block design with five replications of one plant per plot to analyze three leaf vegetative traits (leaf area index, root volume, and total dry mass) and five leaf anatomical traits (polar and equatorial diameter, density and number of stomata, and stomatal area). The data were interpreted using analysis of variance and the Scott-Knott mean cluster test (p bigger, smaller 0.05). The Tocher optimization method and principal component analysis with reference points were used to quantify the genetic divergence. Tocher clustering separated the fifteen clones into five groups, and the scatter in the plane into three groups. Stomatal density was the trait that most contributed to the dissimilarity between genotypes with the potential to be used in future studies for the selection of water deficit-tolerant genotypes. The BRS 3213 genotype showed the greatest genetic dissimilarity and composed a group isolated from the other genotypes in terms of anatomical characteristics. Hybrids 12 and 15 have leaf anatomical traits with higher drought tolerance potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41989/29966,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Attenuation of salt stress on the physiology and production of bell peppers by treatment with salicylic acid,"The use of saline water for irrigation in semi-arid regions has become a reality due to the water scarcity that occurs in most of the year. In this scenario, exogenous application of salicylic acid may be a strategy to mitigate the deleterious effects of salt stress on plants and ensure the production of socioeconomically important crops in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil, such as bell pepper. Thus, this study examines the osmoprotective effect of salicylic acid on gas exchanges, chloroplast pigments and production components of 'All Big' bell pepper plants irrigated with water with different saline levels. The experiment was carried out in greenhouse conditions in Campina Grande - PB, Brazil. Treatments consisted of four levels of electrical conductivity on the irrigation water (0.8, 1.6, 2.4 and 3.2 dS m-1) and four concentrations of salicylic acid (0, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.6 mM), which were distributed in a 4 × 4 factorial arrangement in a randomized block design with three replicates. Increases in irrigation water salinity from 0.8 dS m-1 resulted in changes in gas exchange and total chlorophyll levels of 'All Big' bell pepper plants. The estimated salicylic acid concentration of 1.7 mM reduced the effects of salinity on stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, total chlorophyll and fruit diameters. Irrigation with water of 1.8, 0.8 and 1.6 dS m-1 salinity associated with the estimated salicylic acid concentration of 1.6 mM increased the biosynthesis of chlorophylls a and b and the number of fruits, respectively, in bell pepper plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42093/29908,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Biochemical changes in black oat plants in response to water deficit under different temperatures,"The black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) stands out as a forage of great importance in Brazilian agriculture. However, the productivity and quality of this forage can be affected by abiotic factors, such as temperature and water availability, which affect the physiological processes and facilitate the accumulation of free radicals (reactive oxygen species - ROS). Thus, the objective of this study was to understand the biochemical changes in black oat plants subjected to water deficit at different temperatures. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse in two experimental periods, which presented an average temperature of 20 °C and 24 °C, respectively. Black oat seeds, of the variety IAPAR 61, were sown in pots and the plants were irrigated for 60 days. After which, the pots were covered with plastic bags and the irrigation was suspended. The analyses were carried out in five periods of evaluation - M1: plants before the suspension of irrigation, M2: plants at the first wilting point, M3: three days after plastic removal and irrigation return, M4: four days after M3 and before the second suspension of irrigation, and M5: the second wilting point. The levels of total protein and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), were analyzed. The experimental design was completely randomized, with six replications, in a factorial scheme of average temperature × water management × periods of evaluation, and the means were compared by Tukey’s test at 5%. In response to water deficiency and temperature increase, black oat plants increased their levels of total soluble proteins, and there was greater lipid peroxidation due to the increase in malondialdehyde content. There was no change in the activity of the enzymes catalase and ascorbate peroxidase under water deficit, and these activities decreased with increasing temperature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41678/29904,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Bokashi, simple superphosphate, and fertigation for the growth and nutrition of hybrid Cattleya (Orchidaceae)","Potted flower production is an important floricultural activity. However, there have been few studies on the fertilization management of orchids. Fertigation with urea and potassium chloride is feasible, but little information is available regarding the interaction of these fertilizers with other sources of nutrients. Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of application of bokashi and a simple superphosphate and their interactions with fertigation on the growth and nutrition of hybrid Cattleya. Seedlings of Laeliocattleya Drumbeat × Laeliocattleya Gold Digger hybrid were submitted to two ferti-irrigation levels (absent and present) using urea and potassium chloride as nitrogen and potassium sources, respectively. As complementary fertilization, bokashi and superphosphate were applied singly and in combination. A commercial fertilizer (Peters®) was used as an additional control. Fertigation increased plant height; leaf area; number, length, and diameter of pseudobulbs; dry mass of leaves, pseudobulbs, and roots; and content of chlorophyll, carotenoid, and nitrogen. The application of bokashi resulted in dry mass gain in all plant organs. The combination of fertigation and bokashi was superior to the commercial fertilizer in terms of increased leaf area, chlorophyll A content, carotenoid content, and dry mass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41706/29951,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Parasitism and behavioral responses of Acromyrmex coronatus (Fabricius, 1804) and Acromyrmex crassispinus (Forel, 1909) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) to Myrmosicarius catharinensis","Leaf-cutting ants of the genus Acromyrmex cause serious damage to cultivated forest areas. Some flies of the family Phoridae are known to parasitize them, and the result of this interaction can provide a promising basis for the management of these ants. This study was developed to record the parasitism and behavioral responses of Acromyrmex spp. leaf-cutting ants to parasitoid phorids in the municipality of Londrina-PR, Brazil. Visual examinations and collections of leaf-cutting ants and associated phorids were carried out between October/2019 and April/2020 in selected anthills and their trails, located on the campus of the State University of Londrina (UEL) and at the Botanical Garden of Londrina. The collected insects were preserved in 70% alcohol, for later identification of the species. The behavioral response of the ants to the parasitoids was recorded individually and collectively, following protocols cited in the literature. The frequencies of the different response behaviors exhibited by the attacked ants were compared using analysis of variance. The leaf-cutting ant species Acromyrmex coronatus and Acromyrmex crassispinus were found at the two evaluated sites. Myrmosicarius catharinensis was the only species of parasitoid phorid found, which attacked both ant species. Although the occurrence of M. catharinensis has been reported in other Brazilian states and its association with A. crassispinus recorded in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this is the first report of the occurrence of the phorid in the state of Paraná with a new association for the species A. coronatus. Under foraging action by the parasitoid, 63.5% of the ants exhibited only one behavioral response, while 36.5% showed two. Accelerated walking, attempting to ""bite"" the parasitoid, and adopting a 'C' posture were the most frequent behavioral responses to avoid parasitism. Ants crowding together around a worker and the presence of ""hitchhiker"" workers on the transported leaf fragments were the observed changes in collective behavior, the latter being the most frequent. These changes occurred in all observed ant nests and, in two of them, the constancy of alteration in collective behavior was 53%. These results demonstrate the interference caused in nests of Acromyrmex spp. by the occurrence of M. catharinensis, a potential control agent for this pest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41632/29967,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Physiological potential of Dyckia spp. bromeliad seeds under different temperatures,"Bromeliads have been gaining ground in the economic scenario due mainly to their use as ornamental plants. Bromeliads of the genus Dyckia exhibit different morphologies, and therefore, have relevance in this market. However, some species are threatened due to the extraction of plants from their natural environments. Many of these species are endemic and native to Brazil and there are few studies on their seed physiology; hence, expansion of research into this topic is essential. An alternative for the preservation of such plants is the production of seedlings using seeds. To this end, the objective of this work was to evaluate the physiological potential of seeds of Dyckia brevifolia, Dyckia beateae, and Dyckia excelsa at different temperatures, and determine the number of days to carry out the tests. A completely randomized design was adopted, with three species of Dyckia, analyzed separately, and four temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 35 °C). The following were evaluated: first germination count, germination, germination speed index, length of seedling, and seedling dry weight. The data were analyzed using the Sisvar software for normality and homogeneity, and when the assumptions were met, they were subjected to analysis of variance using the F test (p < 0.05) and the means were compared using the Tukey test at 5% probability. Seeds of D. excelsa emit the radicle more quickly at 20 and 35 °C; however, temperatures of 25 and 30 °C provide better conditions for seedling growth and development. The greatest vigor of D. brevifolia seeds is observed at temperatures of 30 and 35 °C. Seeds of D. beateae emit the radicle more quickly at 20 °C, and the largest seedlings are observed at 35 °C. The first germination count of D. brevifolia, D. beateae, and D. excelsa should be evaluated on the third day after sowing. The germination evaluations for D. excelsa and D. beateae should be carried out on the ninth day after sowing, and those for D. brevifolia on the sixth day after sowing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41186/29901,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Mixture compatibility of ChinNPV baculovirus with herbicides and fungicides used in soybean,"Chrysodeixis includens Walker, 1858 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), commonly known as soybean looper, is one of the main pests that reduces soybean yield due to its defoliation capacity. Population outbreaks of this pest can occur in the vegetative stage of the crop, together with the occurrence of weeds or in the reproductive stage, at the same time as that of diseases. This often requires the use of pesticides against pests and weeds, or fungi at the same time. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of baculovirus ChinNPV with different synthetic chemical herbicides and fungicides used in soybean. Four bioassays were carried out, with or without the addition of ChinNPV to different herbicides and fungicides. The artificial diets were immersed in the solutions of the pesticides and their mixture and supplied to the caterpillars of C. includens, immediately and after one and two hours of mixing. The evaluation was performed by quantifying the number of dead caterpillars. The results showed that the ChinNPV baculovirus is compatible for mixing with all studied herbicides and fungicides, even after two hours of mixing. In all the studied scenarios, baculovirus mixed with chemical pesticides triggered the same mortality as sprayed with baculovirus alone, and values of over 80% mortality of C. includens have always been recorded.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41074/29947,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Edaphic entomofauna associated with coconut crops in the eastern Amazon,"In the Eastern Amazon is the largest continuous coconut crop area in the world. This region is known for its high precipitation levels and an ecosystem of extensive insect biodiversity. It is important to know the local entomofauna and to know whether there is a balance between the different insect groups. This study aimed to understand the influence of seasonality on the dynamics of edaphic insect families, comparing the environment as a whole and in different commercial coconut crop areas and riparian forests in the Eastern Amazon. Forty pitfall traps were installed in the ground at an average distance of 1 m from the coconut stipe. They were filled with 200 ml of an aqueous solution of liquid neutral soap and 70% alcohol. Traps were installed in eight areas: an area of riparian forest (A1) and seven in commercial coconut crop areas (A2 to A8), in the Amazon dry and rainy season. The similarity between the insects was measured using Euclidean distance. The abundance of families in each collection area used qualitative similarity. For family dominance, quantitative similarity was used. Diversity analyses were performed to justify the similarities of the clusters through the Shannon and Simpson Indices. In total, 252,313 individuals, 118 families, and 9 orders were collected. There were many Formicidae in both climatic periods because it is a social insect and has edaphic habits. The families with the most individuals in the collections were Drosophilidae, Staphylinidae, Bostrichidae, Phoridae, Nitidulidae, Scolytidae, Tenebrionidae, Scarabaeidae, Ceratopogomidae, and Platyogastridae. The riparian forest area (A1) showed the greatest diversity and least dominance. The oldest cultivated areas A2 and A3 (7 years) showed the greatest diversity in the dry season. In the rainy season, the most diversified areas were those with the highest land slope (A6 and A7). The most dominant areas were A5 and A8, where the largest number of Solenopsis spp. were found. This study showed the importance of obtaining basic information about coconut entomofauna and conducting research on insect dynamics in agricultural crops in the Amazon region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40400/29969,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and Neospora spp. in stray dogs in the state of Rondônia, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2014 to April 2016. A total of 458 dogs blood samples were collected at the Center for Control of Zoonosis (CCZ), and anti-T. gondii and anti-N. spp. antibody levels were detected and measured using indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The seroprevalence of T. gondii and Neospora spp. in dogs it was 82.20% and 73.85%, respectively. The seroprevalence of coinfections was 47.59%. This is the first report of anti-T. gondii and anti-Neospora spp. antibodies detected in stray dogs in Rolim de Moura, state of Rondônia, Western Brazilian Amazon. Male dogs showed a higher frequency of anti-T. gondii antibodies than female dogs (88.0% vs. 75.3%; p smaller 0.001), presenting 2.41 times more chances of having the disease. High seroprevalence of infection (92.4%: T. gondii and 89.2%: Neospora spp.) was detected in the group bigger, smaller 1-year-old dogs, in all collections, with OR 7.35 and OR 10.27 for the presence of anti-T. gondii and anti-Neospora spp., respectively.

42,2021,Plant density and nitrogen topdressing of high-altitude main-season corn,"An appropriate combination of plant density with nitrogen (N) fertilization can optimize corn growth and increase grain yields. This study evaluated the effects of nitrogen topdressing rates and plant density levels on the agronomic performance of corn. The early hybrid DKB 240 YG, with high yield potential and stability, was evaluated in two summer crops in Mauá da Serra, Paraná (950 m asl), in a Cfb climate, on a Rhodic Eutrudox. The experiment was arranged in randomized complete blocks and subdivided plots with four replications. The plant densities (60,000; 75,000; 90,000 and 105,000 plants ha-1) were assessed in the plots and the nitrogen (ammonium nitrate 32% N) topdressing rates (0, 60, 120, 180 and 240 kg ha-1) in the subplots. The stem diameter, plant height, ear insertion height and grain yield were evaluated. The stem diameter, plant height, ear insertion height and grain yield were influenced by the interaction between plant density and nitrogen topdressing under the tested high-altitude edaphoclimatic conditions. The stem diameter of corn plants decreased due to the increase in plant density whereas nitrogen topdressing attenuated this reduction. Maximum plant height was observed at a density of 75,000 plants ha-1 associated with a topdressing of 169 kg ha-1 of N, and highest ear insertion at 60,000 plants ha-1 and 168 kg ha-1 of N. Corn yield was highest at a density of 105,000 plants ha-1 associated with a topdressing of 185 kg N ha-1 of N.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41202/29902,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Babesia vogeli in dogs from Rio Branco, South-west Amazonia, Brazil",": This is the first report of Babesia vogeli molecular detection in dogs from the state of Acre, northern Brazil. This study aimed to perform the molecular detection of Babesia vogeli in dogs in the municipality of Rio Branco, Acre. Blood samples were collected from 47 dogs presenting with clinical signs comparable to hemoparasitosis. These were dogs which were attended in veterinary clinics from Rio Branco municipality, Acre. Physical examinations, packed cell volume (PCV) determination, platelet number estimation, hemoparasite investigation in the blood (collected from the pinna and peripheral blood), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for piroplasm based on the 18S rRNA gene, were performed. One dog (1/47, 2.1%; CI 95%: 0.1-11.3%) tested positive to Babesia vogeli in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for piroplasms and the resulting sequence showed 100% identity with Babesia vogeli isolates deposited in GenBank®. Co-infection with Ehrlichia spp. was also observed by direct examination (via blood smear).

42,2021,Quantitative carcass characteristics and quality of shoulder and loin of crossbred goat kids receiving diets with live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii),"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii) on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the shoulder and loin of Boer x Saanen crossbred goat kids. Twenty-seven carcasses were used, 13 females and 14 uncastrated males with an average age of 192 days, weighing 30.76 kg, distributed in a completely randomised design using a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (diet and sex). The yeast was added to the feed before pelletising in a proportion of 0.050 g/kg dry matter (DM). When the goats reached an average of 30 kg of live weight, they were slaughtered. No effects of live yeast on quantitative carcass and qualitative characteristics of shoulder and loin were observed. Regarding sex, males had higher slaughter weights (31.73 kg), empty carcass weight (27.98 kg), hot carcass weight (14.39 kg), cold carcass weight (14.22 kg), higher carcass compactness index (0.28 kg/cm), lower slaughter age (176 days) and lower cooling loss (1.20%). For the cut yields, females presented a higher loin yield (11.55%) and males presented a higher neck yield (6.84%). In the shoulder, males presented a higher proportion of bone (18.58%), while females presented a higher proportion of fat (17.09%) and muscle:bone (3.47). In the loin, females showed higher fat deposition (19.54%) in relation to males. The inclusion of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii in the crossbred goat kids’ diet did not generate differences in the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the shoulder and loin.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43416/30072,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Fermentative losses and chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of corn grain silage rehydrated with water or acid whey combined with bacterial-enzymatic inoculant,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rehydration with water or acid whey, as well as the effects of bacterial-enzymatic inoculant on fermentation losses, aerobic stability, and chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of corn grain silages. The treatments consisted of corn kernels (Zea mays) ground through a 3-mm sieve and rehydrated with chlorine-free water or unsalted whey (NaCl) combined or not with bacterial-enzymatic inoculant. This was a 2 x 2 factorial completely randomized design with sources of rehydration (water or whey) and absence and presence of bacterial-enzymatic inoculant with eight replications. Water and acid whey were added to ground corn with 12% moisture in order to increase it to 35%. Rehydrated corn was ensiled in Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) minisilos and stored for 60 d. The bacterial-enzymatic inoculant used was composed of Lactobacillus curvatus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. buchneri, L. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Propionibacterium acidipropionici and Enterococcus faecium, in concentrations of 1010 CFU g-1 and 5% cellulose-based enzyme complex. The aerobic exposure of silages was evaluated for 120 hours. There was interaction (P = 0.02) between the sources of rehydration and the use or not of the inoculant on the values of silage temperature during aerobic exposure. There was a difference for dry matter (DM) losses (P=0.38) between rehydrated corn silages with and without inoculant. DM losses were 37.51% higher in silage without inoculant compared to silage with inoculant (3.84% DM). There was no difference between the sources of rehydration on DM losses (P = 0.39), with a mean value of 4.99%. Corn rehydration using acid whey (P < 0.01) increased 2.19% and 31.36% DM and ash content compared to water, an average of 66.14% and 1.28%, respectively. There was no interaction (P = 0.30) between the sources of rehydration and the use of inoculants on the in vitro digestibility of DM (mean of 79.26%). The use of the bacterial-enzymatic inoculant improved the fermentation characteristics, aerobic stability and nutritional value of corn grain silage rehydrated with water or whey.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43381/30071,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Physiological variables and egg quality from quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) that received water with increasing levels of NaCl and under different temperatures,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of water salinity and ambient temperature on the physiological variables and the quality of Japanese quail eggs (Coturnix coturnix japonica) in the laying phase. The quails received water with increasing levels of salinity (1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 dS m-1) and were kept in climatic chambers under two different temperatures (24ºC and 32ºC). The design used was completely randomised, with a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement (temperatures and salinity levels), with six replicates of eight birds each. Data were submitted for analysis of variance and the means were compared by the Tukey test at 5%. There was no influence (P > 0.05) of water salinity levels on the physiological variables nor on the quality of the birds’ eggs. At 32oC there was an increase (P < 0.05) in respiratory rate, cloacal and body surface temperature of the birds, and a slight reduction (P < 0.05) in the weight of eggs, shells, and percentage of shell. For laying quails, water with salinity levels of up to 6.0 dSm-1 can be used and the birds can be raised in an environment with temperatures up to 32ºC.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43152/30120,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Relationship between metabolic profile, diseases, productive and reproductive performance in high- producing Holstein cows in the postpartum period","The present study aimed to monitor Holstein cows in the postpartum period, and to evaluate the occurrence of clinical diseases and their relationship with metabolic profile, milk yield and composition, and reproductive performance. One hundred and five Holstein cows, 32 primiparous and 73 multiparous, from two dairy herds in Arapoti, Paraná State, were clinically monitored up to ten days after calving. The clinical occurrences diagnosed were: dystocia, metritis, retained placenta, clinical hypocalcemia, displaced abomasum, mastitis, pneumonia, and digital dermatitis. Blood samples were collected at one, two, five, and ten days postpartum for analysis of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and total calcium. Individual milk yield was measured up to 100 days in milk (DIM), and the first test-day was evaluated for milk composition. Statistical analyses were conducted using the MIXED procedure of SAS, and the fixed effects of farm (A and B), parity (primiparous and multiparous), and occurrence of clinical diseases (sick and healthy cows) were included. Forty-eight cows (45.7%) had one or more clinical occurrences. In these sick cows, the BHB concentration at five DIM was higher (P = 0.06) than in healthy cows; 0.78 and 0.57 mmol L-1, respectively. Regarding milk yield, cows with one or more clinical occurrences had lower (P < 0.01) daily milk yield up to 30 DIM, and had a tendency of lower (P = 0.09) accumulated production up to 100 DIM than healthy cows. Sick cows had a tendency to show lower (P = 0.08) milk total solids content than healthy cows; 12.04 and 12.60%, respectively. There were no significant differences between sick and healthy animals in the remaining milk components, or the reproductive parameters assessed. The differences observed for days in the first artificial insemination (AI), AI number, and days open occurred due to the effect of the herd.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42916/30115,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Factors associated with grain feeding in dairy farms located in the central-western region of Paraná State, Brazil","This study aimed to investigate factors associated with grain feeding and determine the typology of dairy farms that use high-grain diets. Twenty-two farm operators were interviewed in three municipalities located in the central-western region of Paraná state, Brazil. Information on reproductive and nutritional management practices, sociodemographic characteristics, and farm performance was collected. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multiple linear regression. Three factors (F1, F2, and F3) were extracted, which together explained 82.61% of the total variance. F1 comprised diet quality, technology, and breeding composition. F2 comprised labor and size. F3 comprised feed quality and schooling. Farms were classified into four groups and compared in terms of factor scores and performance parameters. Group 1 had the highest mean score on F1 (0.715), group 4 on F2 (1.642), and group 2 on F3 (1.116). Groups 4 and 1 had the highest milk productivity (2043.50 and 399.52 L day-1, respectively) and labor efficiency (418.16 and 148.63 L worker-1 day-1, respectively). Group 4 also had the highest mean number of cows per worker (25.52 cows worker-1). Regression analysis revealed that diet quality, technology, and breeding composition (F1) explained the variance in cow productivity. Labor and size, (F2) explained the variance in number of cows per worker. Daily productivity and labor efficiency were explained by both F1 and F2. Feed quality and farm operator’s level of schooling did not explain the variation in any of the variables. We found that roughage quality, breeding technology, and herd breed composition are the major factors associated with grain feeding. Farmers who feed cows high-quality roughage throughout the year and invest in genetic improvement and selective breeding strategies are more likely to adopt high-grain feeding and have high milk productivity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42835/30067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Yield and nutritional value of biomass sorghum (BRS 716) managed in different row spacing and maturity at harvest in the semiarid region of Brazil,"The objective was to evaluate the structural, yield and nutritional characteristics of biomass sorghum BRS 716 managed in different row planting spacing and harvest age in a semiarid region of Brazil. Three row spacing (45, 70 and 90 cm; plots) and four maturity at harvest (70, 100, 130 and 160 days; subplots) were evaluated following a randomized block design in a 3 x 4 split plot arrangement, with eight blocks. The useful area was 3 x 15 m. Variation in soil fertility in the area was the blocking factor. There was interaction between row spacing and maturity at harvest (P < 0.05) on plant height (P = 0.01), dry matter yield (DMY; P < 0.01) and proportion of senescent material (P = 0.01). The DMY observed at the age of 160 days and spacing of 90 cm was 41.40% higher than the DMY at the same age and in spacings of 45 and 70 cm (mean of 21.45 t/ha). As the maturity at harvest increased, there was a reduction in the crude protein content (P < 0.01), potential degradability (P < 0.01) and effective degradability (P < 0.01) of dry matter, and the content of non-fiber carbohydrates (P < 0.01), total digestible nutrients (P < 0.01) and the readily soluble fraction (P < 0.01) of the dry matter increased. Considering the yield and nutritional characteristics of biomass sorghum BRS 716 managed in the semiarid region for silage production, the row spacing of 90 cm and the maturity at harvest of 160 days after planting are recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43109/30143,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Influence of integrated crop-livestock-forest on morphological composition and nutritional value of Marandu palisadegrass under continuous grazing,"This study characterizes the changes in leaf mass, morphological composition and nutritional value of leaf blades of palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) under continuous grazing in the first year of implementation of pasture and after second year of the eucalyptus planting in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System and Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest, which were tested in the four seasons. The experimental design was in random blocks, with three treatments: Crop-Livestock System (ICL) and Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest with two eucalyptus tree densities (ICLF-1L, 196 eucalyptus trees ha-1 and ICLF-3L, 448 eucalyptus trees ha-1) and four replicates. Sixty castrated Nellore cattle with initial weight of 235.43 ± 25.46 kg and mean age of 16 ± 2.81 months were used during the growing phase under continuous grazing. The agronomic variables were: total dry mass of forage, leaves, stem and dead material; leaf:stem and live:senescent material ratios; and accumulation rate. The leaf:stem and live: senescent material relation did not obtain any difference between the evaluated systems. Dry matter, crude protein, fiber fractions and digestibility of leaf blades were evaluated. Dry mass of the forage (6775 kg ha-1), stem (2175 kg ha-1), senescent material (3175 kg ha-1) and dry matter content (28.6%) were greater in the ICL, whereas crude protein (11.3%) was greater in the ICLFs. On the other hand, accumulation rate and dry mass of leaf blades did not change between systems. Thus, until the first year of grazing, tree systems have advantages, because the forage production (accumulation rate) and leaf mass are similar to those of plants in full sun, besides showing higher nutritional value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42812/30066,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"How canopy structural and morphological characteristics, and forage chemical composition affect a pasture-based dairy system?","Pasture-based systems are prevalent among small-scale family farms. Many farmers consider that the nutritional value of the plant is more relevant than the canopy structure. This study aimed to analyze the various factors related to plant structure and chemical composition that most influence milk yield per hectare under rotational stocking. The experiment was performed at the Animal Husbandry Experimental Station of the Extreme South of Bahia. Three rotational stocking systems with three forage species [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. cv. Tifton 85, Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf. cv. Xaraés, and Megathyrsus maximus Jacq. cv. Mombasa] were evaluated. Nine crossbred Holstein x Gyr cows were allocated to a balanced 3 x 3 Latin square design. The cows were rotated in three pastures every 14 days. The experimental period consisted of seven evaluation cycles of 42 days each. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and multivariate linear regression were the statistical techniques used to evaluate plant structure and morphological characteristics, and animal performance. Xaraés palisadegrass and Mombasa guinea grass were similar for all evaluated characteristics (P > 0.05), whereas Tifton 85 was different from them in terms of structural, morphological, and chemical composition characteristics (P < 0.05). In the PCA, 59.1% of the total variance was explained by components 1 and 2 for the structural and morphological characteristics, and forage chemical composition. Forage structural and morphological variables showed better results in the multivariate linear regression analysis for milk yield per hectare. Structural and morphological characteristics were more correlated with Mombasa guinea grass than Xaraés palisadegrass and Tifton 85. The structural and morphological characteristics of forages were the main factors determining milk yield per hectare in exclusively pasture-based systems with animals of low production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41659/30064,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Economic impacts of Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 infection in Brazil: Meta-analysis based on epidemiological indicators,"This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to estimate the economic impact of Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoAHV1) infection in Brazil using epidemiological indicators through a meta-analysis. Specific descriptors were used to retrieve studies from the Scopus, PubMed, Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Teses e Dissertações, and Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da Capes databases, selecting those that met the inclusion criteria established between the years 2000 and 2020. The selected studies were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using prevalence data as the primary outcome with a 95% confidence interval (CI) with a meta-analysis of random effects and measures of heterogeneity, significance, magnitude of the effect, and measurement of publication bias. Abortion costs and estimates were calculated based on the prevalence of BoAHV1 infection in Brazil and the characteristics of the agent as viral subtypes that cause abortion, period of occurrence, average pregnancy rate, and morbidity applied to susceptible animals and animal replacement values. The results were obtained from 49 studies included for meta-analysis where a prevalence of BoAHV1 infection of 54.12% (95% CI: 49.07% - 59.26%) in the bovine population and 88.53% (95% CI: 82.97%–92.43%) was present. From the structured formula, it is estimated that 258,779 bovine abortions occur, which causes a total loss, based only on the occurrence of abortion, of US $ 48,402,244.00 to the country. It is noteworthy that because of the losses caused, strict control and eradication measures need to be implemented based on the elaboration of normative instruction that includes health education measures, vaccination, tests for traffic, and animal trade so that BoAHV1 infections do not continue to negatively impact national producers economically, productively, and socially.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43520/30063,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Immune response in Santa Inês sheep during Fasciola hepatica infection,"In the present study, we describe the proliferative response and the IFN - y, IL-10, IL-4 cytokine expression profiles in peripheral blood, and IgG production, after the experimental infection of Santa Inês sheep with 250 Fasciola hepatica metacercariae that were evaluated at 60 and 210 days post-infection(dpi). The cytokine expression profile at 60 dpi was characterized by the production of IFN - y, and IL-10, which is indicative of an initial mixed Th1/Th2 response. The modulation of the response occurred at 210 dpi with a predominance of IL-10 and IL-4 over IFN - y. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood stimulated with F. hepatica antigen exhibited proliferative capacity at 60 dpi, whereas the response was consistent with modulation from Th1 to Th2 in the chronic phase. The IgG antibody response was more marked at 60 days than at 210 dpi, confirming the mixed-response profile. The late modulation of the T lymphocyte response in association with the predominance of IL-10 and IL-4 at 210 dpi suggests the involvement of these cytokines after the establishment of the parasites in the bile ducts. The transition from a mixed to a regulatory response in the chronic phase was also accompanied by a reduced number of eggs per gram of feces.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42878/30059,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Feline obesity: risk factors and clinical and metabolic findings,"Excess body fat can cause a series of metabolic and mechanical effects on the body. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the clinical, metabolic, and risk factors of overweight (OW) cats. For the acceptance of participation in the research, the tutors were asked to answer a questionnaire containing 34 questions and to point out the body condition score (BCS) on a sheet containing nine images of different scores (1 to 9 on a 9-point scale). Thereafter, the body evaluations were performed as a classification of the BCS on a scale from 1 to 9, with an ideal score (IS) of BCS 5 and OW for BCS > 5. Further, the lean mass index and morphometric measurements (thoracic and abdominal circumferences and height and length of the patella to calcaneal tuberosity) were performed to estimate the percentage of body fat. Systolic blood pressure was measured using the non-invasive Doppler method and blood was collected for hemogram and serum biochemistry (creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol). After these analyses, we sought to guide and raise the awareness of the tutors to promote the correct nutritional and environmental management of the animals. Thirty adult cats were divided into two groups, based on the classification of the BCS, with eight having an IS and 22 being OW. The OW group was found to have a low level of physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, and higher values of body characteristics. Additionally, there was a median agreement between the perceptions of the clinician and the tutors. Therefore, it was concluded that the main laboratory alteration found in the obese cats was hypercholesterolemia, which was a critical parameter. It was observed that a low degree of physical activity could cause excess weight gain. It was found that the guardians of the cats with ideal weight underestimated the BCS, which could contribute to the supply of excess food and consequently, obesity. Thus, this study was sought to guide and raise the awareness of tutors, to promote the correct nutritional and environmental management thereby providing welfare and quality of life to the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43112/30060,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,In vitro ruminal fermentation kinetics of diets with crambe cake protein replacing soybean meal protein by gas production technique,"The objective of this study was to evaluate ingredients and diets containing increasing levels of crambe cake protein replacing soybean meal protein, with in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters using a gas production technique. Diets were formulated for feedlot lambs and contained different levels of crambe cake protein (0, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 g kg-1) replacing soybean meal protein. Corn silage was used as roughage. Carbohydrate digestion rates were estimated using the in vitro gas production technique and the cumulative gas production kinetics were analyzed using the bicompartmental logistic model. The parameters values of ruminal degradation kinetics were generated using the R statistical program with the Gauss-Newton algorithm and then subjected to analysis of variance and regression (when necessary) according to a completely randomized experimental design with five treatments and five replications. Upon carbohydrate fractionation of ingredients and experimental diets, it was observed that corn grain and corn silage presented the highest levels of total carbohydrates (TC), with values of 128.3 and 464.8 g kg-1 dry matter (DM) in fraction B2, respectively. Lower TC content was found for soybean meal and crambe cake (CC). There was a predominance of fractions A + B1 in the ingredients and experimental diets. The B2 fraction decreased in the diets with the inclusion of the CC protein, and CC presented the highest C fraction. Protein fractionation (g kg-1 DM and g kg-1 crude protein - CP), the ingredients and diets showed a higher proportion of fractions A and B1 + B2. In in vitro degradation, the diet without CC (0 g kg-1 DM) showed the highest final cumulative gas production (365.04 mL g-1 of incubated DM), while the CC presented the lowest volume (166.68 mL g-1 of incubated DM). The gas volume of non-fibrous carbohydrate fermentation and fibrous carbohydrate degradation rate exhibited a quadratic effect according increasing levels of CC (Pmax = 265.8 g kg-1 DM and Pmin = 376.3 g kg-1 DM, respectively). The lag time and final gas volume showed a decreasing linear effect with increasing levels of CC protein. The degradation rate of non-fibrous carbohydrates and the final volume of fibrous carbohydrates did not differ. Replacing soybean meal protein with CC protein at the level of 250 g kg-1 of dry matter in diets formulated for feedlot lambs leads to good profiles of ruminal fermentation kinetics with respect to the degradation of fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42201/30293,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Comparative analysis of the hormone production and gene expression profiles in ovine uterus tissue during oestrus cycle synchronized using medroxyprogesterone acetate plus eCG and prostaglandin analogue,"The combination of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and gonadotropin chorionic (eCG) has been widely used to synchronize oestrus cycle in sheep, but their effects on the gene expression in uterine tissue are yet to be elucidated. To evaluate the effect of MPA + eCG or prostaglandin analogue (PA) treatments on the rate of oestrus cycle synchronization, as well as further hormone production and gene expression profiles in uterine tissue, 14 Santa Inês ewes were randomly selected. The MPA + eCG group (n = 7) received intravaginal insertion of MPA-impregnated sponges for 14 days and was administered 350 IU eCG on the day of sponge withdrawal. The PA group (n = 7) was administered two doses of 100 ug of PA separated by 12 days. The ewes were assessed for the rate of oestrus cycle synchronization and the serum concentrations of progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Additionally, the expression of estrogen receptor (ERalfa), progesterone receptor (P4R), and immunolocalization of interferon receptor (IFNAR1) in the uterine tissue samples collected 15 th day post-mating were examined. The rate of oestrus cycle synchronization was 100% (n=7/7) and 57.14% (n=4/7) in the MPA + eCG and PA groups, respectively. Moreover, the MPA + eCG group exhibited higher serum concentration of P4 than the PA group (p smaller 0.05). However, the E2 serum concentration did not differ between the two groups (p larger 0.05). The relative expression of P4R and ERalfa mRNA analyzed using real-time PCR and immunodetection of IFNAR1 were similar between the two groups tested (p larger 0.05). Conclusively, MPA + eCG treatment improved the rate of oestrus cycle synchronization and endogenous P4 production; however, it did not affect the expression of sex steroid receptors and IFNAR1 in uterine ovine tissue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43115/30061,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Frequency of pathogens in routine bacteriological diagnosis in fish and their antimicrobial resistance,"Aquaculture is one of the sectors of animal husbandry with the fastest growth rate. However, the increase in the sector's production chain without proper management can result in factors that favor the development of diseases, especially infectious diseases caused by bacteria. Many factors, such as agriculture or industry resides, improper use of antibiotics in animals or humans, have contributed to increased environmental pressure and the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while residues from these drugs can remain in the carcasses and in water a risk to public and environmental health. From that, we identified the bacterial genus/species and their bacterial resistance to antibiotics from samples received from fish disease outbreaks for bacteriosis diagnosis between January 2017 and October 2020. Isolated bacteria were subjected to the Kirby and Bauer sensitivity test for five classes of antibiotics (penicillins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, amphenicols, and tetracyclines). Of the 181 analyzed outbreaks, 232 bacteria were isolated, including Streptococcus spp., Aeromonas spp., Edwardsiella spp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chromobacterium violaceum, Flavobacterium spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Vibrio spp., Enterobacter spp., Chryseobacterium meningosepticum. Of the 232 bacteria, 40 strains were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR), with Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas spp., and Edwardsiella spp. representing more than half of this number (22/total). With several bacteria demonstrating resistance to Brazilian aquaculture-legalized drugs (tetracycline and florfenicol), it is mandatory to research, not only for alternatives to the use of antibiotics, but also for other drugs effective against the main circulating bacterial pathogens. In addition, vigilance over the occurrence of resistant bacteria is necessary, considering the appearance of zoonotic bacteria with multi-resistant characteristics, becoming a public health concern.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42196/30113,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Effect of bentonite on the health and dairy production of cows submitted to a diet naturally contaminated by mycotoxins,"Mycotoxins often contaminate cattle food, which can cause liver damage, immunosuppression, and reduced milk production. Although previous studies have shown the benefits of adsorbents in farm animals, knowledge regarding their mechanism of action is limited, especially when intoxication occurs due to naturally contaminated diets. The present study aimed to assess whether the daily oral administration of mycotoxin adsorbent bentonite clay based on aluminosilicate for 56 days, would attenuate these changes in 18 dairy cows, which were multiparous in the middle of the lactation stage, and were consuming a diet containing fumonisin B1 and B2, zearalenone, and desoxynivalenol. The animals were divided into treatment (TG, n = 9) and control (CG, n = 9) groups, and subjected to assessment of liver functions, hematological assessments, assessment of oxidative leucocyte metabolism by the tetrazolium nitroazul (NBT) technique, and physical chemical analysis of milk, every week for two months, totaling eight analyses. It was observed that the use of the adsorbent caused a reduction in the milk excretion of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), an increase in levels of serum protein (p = 0.03) and albumin (p = 0.0001), an increase in leukocyte oxidative metabolism from day 24 of treatment(p = 0.05), and increased milk production from the day 16 of treatment (p = 0.08). There was no improvement in the physicochemical indices of the milk. It was concluded that the use of an aluminosilicate-based adsorbent was able to attenuate the effects of mycotoxins on the function of leukocytes and increase milk production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43509/30062,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Histological evaluation of the intestine of broiler chickens: comparison of three sampling methods,"After the growth-promoting antibiotics prohibition, intestinal health became an increasing concern worldwide in poultry farming. The intestinal histological evaluation is an inexpensive technique that brings relevant information, but in poultry, the immediate process of intestinal post-mortem autolysis interferes directly on the samples quality for histological analysis hindering a precise diagnosis. This study aimed to standardize a technique for broilers’ intestines sample collection and fixation for histological analysis. Seven broiler chickens received a standard diet until 23 days of age when they were euthanized. Fragments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected using three methods: intestine strips, transverse section, and Swiss roll and posteriorly fixed in 10% buffered formalin and bouin solution. Tissue samples were submitted for histological (number of villi and viable villi per field) and morphometrical (villi height, crypt depth and villi:crypt ratio) evaluations and the results analyzed statistically. A significant high number of villi and viable villi per field in all regions was observed in the Swiss roll method. In the duodenum (p= 0.0066) and jejunum (p= 0.0058) an interaction between the Swiss roll method and the fixative buffered formalin was observed in the viable and number of villi per field, respectively. Regarding the morphometrical analysis significant differences were observed, in the jejunum villi height sampling by the methods Swiss roll (1,157.66 ± 148.25 µm, p= 0.0015) that showed the highest mean. Deeper crypt depths were observed in the jejunum (156.59 ± 15.68 µm, p= 0.0002) and ileum (131.13 ± 15.01 µm, p= 0.0006) collect by the Swiss roll method. An interaction between the bouin fixative was also observed in the jejunum (p= 0.0223) for this variable. Duodenum sampling by transversal section (12.68 ± 1.45 µm, p= 0.0076) was the only segment that had a significant difference for villi:crypt ratio, showing the highest mean. It can be concluded that the Swiss roll technique was the best method for morphometrical evaluation of the chickens’ intestines, since the highest counts of villi per field and viable villi per field were obtained, while buffered formalin was considered as the best fixative.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42061/30056,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Laboratory profile of malnutrition in hospitalized dogs,"Malnutrition occurs when the supply of available nutrients is less than organic demand. It is an underdiagnosed problem in veterinary medicine and can result in several negative metabolic consequences, with greater morbidity and mortality. Currently, the classification of nutritional status (NS) is performed subjectively in veterinary medicine, so studies and discoveries about laboratory markers (objectives) of malnutrition are desirable. This study evaluated the correlations between several laboratory variables (practical and low-cost measurements) and the nutritional status (NS) of 246 dogs from a veterinary school hospital in southern Brazil. In this way, the laboratory profile of malnutrition in this population is evident. NS was classified by body condition score (BCS) and muscle mass score (MMS). A patient was considered to be malnourished if the BCS was less than 3 (values from 1 to 9). The laboratory variables analyzed were hemogram, cholesterol, total protein (TP), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), CRP/albumin ratio, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin (TF), transferrin saturation index (TSI), and transthyretin. The means and standard deviations of the variables, correlation analyses, and comparative analyses (Kruskal-Wallis in alfa = 5%) were calculated. This research aimed to identify objective and practical malnutrition markers that help in the elaboration of a protocol for nutritional evaluation in diseased dogs. Low values of TF, TIBC, TP, hemogram, and TSI elevation were indicative of malnutrition. Additionally, cholesterol and albuminemia are not good markers of malnutrition in dogs with systemic diseases. For the graduation of the inflammatory state (important to differentiate inflammatory hypoproteinemia from protein malnutrition), it is more reliable to measure the CRP/albumin ratio. Canine transthyretin cannot be measured with reagents designed for humans, such as those used in this study. It was possible to conclude that laboratory indicators of malnutrition in sick dogs include low values of TF, TIBC, and TP, anemia, and elevations of TSI. The joint changes in these markers gradually reinforced the diagnosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42774/30080,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Effect of adding anethole to the cryopreservation medium (powdered coconut water) on morphology, kinetics, and oxidative stress of buck sperm","The quality of post-thawing goat sperm is critical to the success of artificial insemination protocols and may be influenced by extenders, cryoprotectants, and antioxidant substances. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the antioxidant anethole on goat sperm diluted in preservation medium based on powdered coconut water (ACP-101c) and frozen. For that, each ejaculate was submitted to the following treatments: ACP-101c (control); control plus supplementation with 30, 300, or 2000 µg/mL anethole. The samples were thawed and evaluated for morphology, kinetics, membrane integrity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of anethole increased morphological abnormalities (P < 0.05), however, it did not affect sperm kinetics. Flow cytometry analysis showed that sperm cells cryopreserved with 300 µg/mL anethole had lower acrosome integrity than those cryopreserved in other treatments. Evaluation of oxidative stress revealed that cells stored in the presence of 2000 µg/mL anethole had small amounts of ROS when compared to those preserved in the control medium alone or supplemented with 300 µg/mL anethole (P < 0.05). After cryopreservation of sperm with 2000 µg/mL anethole, the highest percentage of viable sperm without ROS was observed (P < 0.05). In conclusion, despite reducing ROS levels, the supplementation of anethole in ACP-101c did not affect sperm kinetics or membrane integrity post-thawing, however, it did cause morphological damage to sperm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41847/30348,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Organic carbon mineralization of the biochar and organic compost of poultry litter in an Argisol,"The dynamics of the organic residues added to the soil are closely related to its mineralization rate. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the organic carbon mineralization in soil samples incubated with different doses of biochar and organic compost from poultry litter. Carbon mineralization was evaluated experimentally by measuring the C-CO2 liberated by incubating 200 g of soil mixed with different doses 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 t ha-1 of both biochar and organic compost for 61 days. The soil microbial activity, and consequently the carbon mineralization, increased with the application of doses of biochar and organic compost from the poultry litter. The highest C-CO2 mineralization was observed in the treatments that received organic compost. The carbon mineralization process followed chemical kinetics with two simultaneous reactions. The greatest amount of released and accumulated C-CO2 was observed in the soil incubated with 15 and 20 t ha-1 of organic compost from the poultry litter. The doses of biochar did not influence the content of mineralized carbon; this behavior was not verified with the use of this compost, whose highest content corresponded to 85.69 mg kg-1, applying 20 t ha-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43054/30050,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Physiological behavior of Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg. seedlings under flooding and shading,"Physiological information about native species, make it possible to know their potential for use in programs to recovery degraded areas. Nowadays climate changes are severe and factors as water and light are involved with plant development and growth. We hypothesized that shading may contribute to adjusting the characteristics of photosynthetic metabolism of Campomanesia xanthocarpa seedlings under flooding. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the flooding times and shading levels for gas exchanges and the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) in C. xanthocarpa seedlings. Seedlings were grown under two water regimes (control and flooding), three levels of shading (0, 30, and 70%) and 4 evaluation periods (0, 15, 30, and 45 days). We verified damages to the photosynthetic apparatus and reductions in the efficiency of the photochemical process under flooding and at a high level of shading (70%) in a short period (15 days). However, seedlings showed favourable responses to the adjustment over the 45 days of exposure to those conditions. According to the multivariate analysis, it was possible to identify the relation between photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance as the main factor of metabolic adjustments in the tolerance of C. xanthocarpa to flooding and high shading intensity. C. xanthocarpa was more sensitive to short periods of flooding conditions and full sun and high level of shading (70%), however, it presented better adjustment responses to flooding periods when associated with 30% shade.stas de ajuste aos períodos de alagamento quando associado ao 30% de sombra.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42926/30049,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Influence of foliar-applied glycinebetaine on growth, yield and some key physiological and biochemical attributes of grape (Vitis vinifera L.)","Glycinebetaine (GB) plays an imperative role to mitigate the opposing impact of several environmental stresses in various crops. The objective of this investigation was to scrutinize the response of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) to the foliar application of GB. Diverse levels of GB (0, 10, 20 and 30 mM) were applied three times with fifteen days interval to grape cv. King’s Ruby. All levels of GB improved the physiological, biochemical and growth attributes of the grape. As compared to control treatment, foliar spray of GB applied at 30 mM increased the number of leaves/vine, leaf area and number of newly emerged branches/plant by 20.55%, 12.28% and 48.13%, respectively. The pH of grape juice was decreased by increasing GB levels. However, total soluble solids, total chlorophyll contents, grape yield and photosynthesis rate was recorded maximum with foliar spray of GB applied at 30 mM. The regression model predicted that each increment in GB level enhanced the number of leaves/plant and the number of newly emerged branches/plant by 1.8 and 0.7, respectively. Thus, it is concluded that exogenous application GB applied at 30 mM might be more useful to obtain the optimum growth and quality of grapes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43226/30052,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Physical-physiological quality and early performance of sorghum plants under different boron doses via seed,"Boron (B) deficiency is commonly found in tropical crops, among which sorghum stands out for its limited yield under B shortage. However, as a micronutrient, the range between its adequate and toxic levels is narrow, thus fertilization should be cautiously applied. Our goal was to evaluate the physiological and physical quality, as well as early performance, of grain sorghum seedlings under different B doses applied via seeds. Treatments consisted of six doses of boric acid (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 12.5 g Kg-1 seeds) plus a control (uncoated seeds). Boron doses were applied to seeds by coating, in which dolomitic limestone and glue were used for pellet formation. Coated seeds were assessed for physical, physiological, and nutritional characteristics in the laboratory, and early seedling performance was evaluated in a greenhouse. Seed tests were carried out in a fully randomized design, while seedling evaluations were carried out in a randomized block design. Boron application to seeds had no significant effect on seed physical characteristics, despite increases in coated seed sizes. Boron doses had a negative effect on the length and dry mass accumulation of both plant shoot and root. Seed-applied B accumulated mainly in roots and significantly interfered with Ca and Mg accumulations in sorghum seeds, shoots, and roots.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43107/30051,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Initial performance of ‘Gem’ avocado trees in the Central-Western region of São Paulo State,"The introduction of new avocado cultivars into producing countries of the Southern Hemisphere may extend the offer period of fresh fruit for export. The ‘Gem’ (‘3-29-5’) avocado is known for extending the marketing period of ‘Hass’-like avocados. This study aimed to evaluate the horticultural performance of ‘Gem’ avocado trees between the 4th and 6th years after planting (2016-2018), in a commercial orchard in the Central-Western region of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. ‘Gem’ avocado trees grafted onto seedling rootstocks were evaluated regarding tree size, shoot growth, flowering, and fruit yield, quality and maturation. In the evaluated biennium, the trees showed a strong upright growth habit and compact tree size. Flowering occurred mainly in indeterminate inflorescences. Fruit yield varied between 106.89 to 116.89 kg tree-1, and 75-91% of the fruit classified within size counts 12 (306 to 365 g/fruit) to 18 (211 to 235 g/fruit), and reached physiological maturity in late June, but could be picked until October, i.e, four to eight months later than ‘Hass’. ‘Gem’ is a new alternative for extending fruit offer of late-maturity avocado cultivars and allowing higher profit to the farmers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42780/30047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Electrical conductivity test in the evaluation of the physiological potential of treated and stored soybean seeds,"Soybean seed treatment contributes to the maintenance of seed quality, but the effect of commercial formulations and chemical products on the effectiveness of the electrical conductivity test based on electrolyte leaching has been frequently questioned. This study aimed to verify the interference of the chemical seed treatment of two soybean cultivars on the effectiveness of the electrical conductivity test in evaluating the vigor of freshly treated and stored seeds. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of seven seed treatments and two evaluation periods (0 and 60 days after storage), with four replications. The used seed treatments consisted of 1) fipronil + pyraclostrobin + thiophanate-methyl, 2) imidacloprid + thiodicarb + carbendazim + thiram, 3) abamectin + thiamethoxan + fludioxonil + mefenoxam + thiabendazole, 4) carbendazim + thiram, 5) fludioxonil + mefenoxam + thiabendazole, 6) carboxin + thiram, and 7) control (no treatment). The cultivars were BRS 360 RR and BRS 284, which were analyzed separately. Germination, accelerated aging, emergence, and electrical conductivity tests were carried out. No differences were detected between the control and chemical treatments performed on seeds of the two freshly treated soybean cultivars regarding germination, accelerated aging, and emergence tests. The germination test stood out after storage with the cultivar BRS 360 RR, showing the maintenance of germination potential for seeds treated with carbendazim + thiram and the control treatment. Therefore, the chemical treatment of soybean seeds interferes with the result of the electrical conductivity test. The electrical conductivity test is effective in segregating seed lots in terms of vigor level. The electrical conductivity test correlates with the other vigor tests used to identify the reduction in the physiological seed quality with storage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42817/30078,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Performance of ‘Galia’ melon grown under different soil cation ratios,"The northeast region of Brazil stands out in the production and export of melon. In this region, where this crop is mostly grown, part of the soil is of limestone origin, as is the irrigation water used. Over successive cultivations, these conditions can lead to soil alkalinization due to the accumulation of basic cations of the exchange complex, such as Ca, Mg, K and Na, in soils that are already rich in bases, thus influencing nutrient availability and, consequently, crop yield. On this basis, this study was developed to identify the cation ratios (K:Mg:Ca) of the soil that best correlate with attributes indicative of ‘Gália’ melon production. Two experiments were carried out in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018), in a randomized-block design with five treatments and five replicates. Treatments consisted of the following cation ratios (K:Mg:Ca) for experiment I, whose soil had a K content of 0.40 cmolc dm-3: T1 (1:3:34), T2 (1:3:21), T3 (1:3:9), T4 (1:0.8:9) and T5 (1:11:34); and experiment II, where the soil had 0.56 cmolc dm-3 of K: T1 (1:1.6:29.8), T2 (1:1.4:13.3), T3 (1:1.4:8.5), T4 (1:0.5:8.5) and T5 (1:4.8:29.8). The following traits were evaluated: chemical analyses of the soil during the flowering phase and at the end of the cycle, nutrient concentration in the diagnostic leaf during the fruiting phase, total yield, marketable yield, average total weight, average marketable weight, total number of fruits and number of marketable fruits per plant. The cation ratios influenced the average total and marketable fruit weights only in experiment I, but not yield. Therefore, when associated with irrigation water from the Açu sandstone aquifer and fertigation, the high absolute K and medium to high Mg contents are sufficient to meet the K and Mg nutrient requirements, dispensing with correction of the cation ratio.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41051/30045,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Seed and seedling morphology of Bauhinia scandens L.,"Bauhinia scandens has potential importance as an ornamental and medicinal plant. Researchers have isolated and identified 1-O-alkylglycerol in the leaves of the B. scandens plant, and established antitumor properties using the Brine Shrimp toxicity test, an internationally accepted bioassay. Although this species has high potential, little is known about the viability of seedling production and the morphology of these plants, particularly in terms of seed characteristics and initial stages of germination. The objective of this study was to characterize the seed morphology, germination, and seedlings of B. scandens. Seed water content, weight, and coloration were evaluated. This study also included a description of seed biometrics, external and internal structures, germination, and seedling morphology. Internal seed morphology was evaluated by the anatomical sectioning and X-ray methods. The morphology data obtained were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis and germination data were determined using Cramér’s V. B. scandens seeds have a coloration ranging from very dark grayish-red to dark reddish-brown, flat oblong shapes, and rounded bases and apexes with full or slightly undulating margins. Healthy seedlings are produced mainly by seeds with well-formed internal structures. The reddish petiole of the seedling leaves is a taxonomic character for B. scandens identification. The non-domestication and genetic variability of this species reflect on the seed and seedling color and size variation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41656/30046,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Root morphological traits of oil palm genotypes with differential resistance to fatal yellowing,"Brazil has an extensive area where the climate and soil are suitable for oil palm growing. However, in part of this area, production has been limited by the occurrence of the fatal yellowing (FY) anomaly, whose initial symptom is the rotting of absorptive roots. This symptom can be more severe in oil palm genetic materials with a smaller root system. The aim of this study was to examine morphological traits of roots and shoots of seedlings of three oil palm genotypes with different degrees of resistance to FY, namely, Tenera (sensitive), Caiaué (resistant) and Interspecific Hybrid (resistant) to provide bases to elucidate the differential resistance of these materials to FY. Shoot biomass did not vary statistically between the genetic materials. The mass, length and area of fine and very fine roots were significantly higher in the Interspecific Hybrid than in Caiaué and Tenera. The fine and very fine roots of Interspecific Hybrid had a larger mass than Caiaué (114 and 133%, respectively) and Tenera (216 and 178%, respectively). The Interspecific Hybrid also exhibited higher values for the length of fine and very fine roots than Caiaué (155 and 99% respectively) and Tenera (228 and 94% respectively). The root traits of the Interspecific Hybrid and Tenera are compatible with their differential resistance to FY. Our results demonstrate the importance of expanding the study of the relationship between root morphology and resistance to FY in these genetic materials under conditions that favor the occurrence of the anomaly, such as flooding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40897/30043,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Influence of energy supplementation on associative effects in Nellore bulls on a tropical pasture during the rainy season,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of energy supplementation on associative effects between forage and concentrate supplements and on the performance of beef cattle on a tropical pasture during the rainy season. Twenty-eight Nellore bulls averaging 19 months of age and 325.2 ± 4.1 kg were allotted to a completely randomized design and distributed into four paddocks of two hectares each with a tropical pasture for 84 d. The treatments consisted of bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture without concentrate supplementation or bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture receiving concentrate supplementation at 15 (S15), 30 (S30) or 45% (S45) of the total digestible nutrients (TDN) requirement. All bulls had ad libitum access to mineral supplementation. The amount and chemical composition of the supplement were adjusted every 28 d. Forage and supplement intakes were evaluated in all animals using fecal markers. Crude protein: digestible organic matter ratio decreased with supplementation; consequently, the imbalance between dietary protein and energy increased. Forage intake decreased with increasing supplementation. The substitution rates of pasture for supplementary feed were 0.14, 0.33, and 0.46 for bulls from S15, S30, and S45 treatments, respectively. However, the apparent DM digestibility increased linearly with supplementation level. Supplementation improved the assimilation of ammonia-N in the rumen. Energy supplementation for Nellore bulls on tropical pastures during the rainy season provides excess energy relative to protein, resulting in a substitution effect of supplement intake on forage intake. Moreover, energy supplementation does not improve body weight gain. Protein sources should be added to supplements for balancing protein and energy levels, thereby reducing a likely substitution effect.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42027/29678,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Effects of breeder age and short-term temperature stimulation during incubation on performance, organ weight, and carcass yield in male and female broilers","Birds develop thermoregulatory control during the last days of incubation. Different temperature conditioning programs have been proposed to prepare broiler chicks for post-hatch life. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term temperature (STT) stimulation and breeder age on hatching performance, embryo development, yolk absorption, and post-hatch performance of male and female broilers. A 2 × 2 factorial completely randomized design was used, with two breeder ages (30 and 60 wk), two temperature incubation programs (control and STT), and 2,520 eggs per treatment. Eggs were distributed in two large-scale commercial incubators with a capacity of 120,960 eggs. The control group was subjected to a standard single-stage incubation program (37.2-37.4 °C), whereas the STT group was subjected to a temperature increment of 1 °C for 4 h on embryonic days 16, 17, 18, and 19. Embryos were analyzed at 16 and 19 days of incubation, and chicks at hatch. At 19 days of incubation, STT conditioning resulted in lower yolk sac weight in embryos from 60-wk-old breeders and higher relative weight of the gastrointestinal tract in embryos from 30-wk-old breeders. At hatch, males had lower residual yolk weight, females had greater length, and chicks from 60-wk-old breeders subjected to STT had higher body weight and relative weight of the gastrointestinal tract. Eggs from 30-wk-old breeders showed higher fertility and hatchability and lower infertility, mortality, and second-grade chick percentages. Regarding performance, it was found that males had higher body weight from 7 to 42 days of age and higher whole leg yields. Females, on the other hand, had higher fat yields. Breeder age and sex influenced gastrointestinal tract development, carcass yield, and performance. A 1 °C increase in incubation temperature for 4 h from days 16 to 19 of incubation affected yolk absorption and digestive tract development in chicks from 60-wk-old breeders without, however, influencing performance results.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42026/29677,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Grazing height and nitrogen fertilization strategy in black oat/maize succession,"This study was developed to examine the effect of combining nitrogen (N) fertilization strategies and pasture management heights on animal and grain production in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System. The experiment was carried out in the municipality of Abelardo Luz - SC, Brazil, between April 2017 and April 2018. A randomized-block design was adopted, with the treatments arranged in a 2×2 factorial arrangement with three replicates. The first factor was the height of the pasture managed under continuous grazing: high (HH, 20 cm) or low (LH, 12 cm). The second factor corresponded to the N application times: in the winter, in the pasture (NP), and in the summer, in the grain crop (NG), in a single N rate of 200 kg ha-1 as topdressing. The forage species used during the pasture phase was black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb), and the pasture was grazed by Nellore × Charolais crossbred steers with an initial body weight of 260 kg. The summer crop was maize (Zea mays). Average daily gain (ADG) and herbage allowance were higher in HH than in LH, whereas animal load was higher in HH. Between the N application times, the animal load was higher in NP. Pasture management height and N fertilization strategy did not affect the variables of number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, thousand-grain weight, or total grain yield, which overall averaged 14,090 kg ha-1. In conclusion, the inversion of nitrogen fertilization between the periods of winter pasture production and grain crop and the management height of the black oat pasture do not compromise the production of maize grains in the summer, or animal production per area. However, steer performance is greater (higher ADG) when the pasture is managed at 20 cm, whereas a high grazing intensity significantly reduces straw on the soil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41714/29675,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Genetic parameters and trends for reproductive traits in Blanco Orejinegro cattle from Colombia,"The Colombian creole cattle breed Blanco Orejinegro (BON) is an important zoogenetic resource, but there is little knowledge about the genetic parameters and trends of its reproductive traits. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate parameters for the reproductive traits calving interval (CI), age at first calving (AFC), gestation duration (GD) and genetic trends for CI in the BON breed. Genealogy information from 7,799 animals was used, and employing the MTDFREML program, the components of the variance, heritability (h2), repeatability (rep), and estimated breeding values (EBV) for CI (n=3308), AFC (n=729), and GD (n=306) were estimated, in addition to the inbreeding coefficient (F) of the population. Genetic trends were established through linear regression using R software. Finally, the animals were classified as inbred (F>0) and noninbred (F=0), and the effect of inbreeding on reproductive performance was established through a generalized linear model using the R program. An average F value of 4.41%±0.06 was observed. The h2 for CI was 0.11±0.03 with a rep of 0.15±0.04; for AFC, h2 was 0.00±0.05; and for GD, h2 was 0.00±0.08. The genetic trend for CI was -0.01 days/year. Finally, for CI, inbreeding depression was evident; this trait increased when inbreeding increased. These results indicate an important environmental influence on reproductive traits. The heritability estimate for CI suggests that little genetic progress could be achieved through selection. The evidence of inbreeding depression raises the need to control inbreeding to conserve this genetic resource.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41670/29674,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Effects of including autolyzed yeast in the finishing of feedlot steers,"Functional additives, such as autolyzed yeasts, have been used to achieve greater production efficiency and animal health. These compounds are also alternatives to the use of performance-enhancing antimicrobials. The objective was to evaluate the productive performance, ingestive behavior, apparent digestibility of feed DM and the carcass characteristics of beef steers finished in feedlot receiving autolyzed yeasts in the diet. The experimental design was randomized blocks, consisting of three treatments and six repetitions, where each repetition was represented by a stall with two animals. 36 bulls, ½ Angus × ½ Nelore blood, from the same herd, with an average age of 11 months and an average body weight of ± 330 kg were used. The treatments were as follows: CON - yeast-free diet; Y4 - yeast diet (4 g animal day-1) and Y7 - yeast diet (7 g animal day-1). The product used is a functional ingredient containing the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The inclusion of autolyzed yeasts resulted in greater daily body weight gain and better feed conversion in the initial feedlot phase. The apparent digestibility of DM of diets containing autolyzed yeast was superior to the control diet, and its use did not interfere with the animal ingestive behavior. Supplementation with autolyzed yeasts at the inclusion level of 4 g day-1 promoted better results in the finishing of feedlot steers, and that the supplemented groups (4 g animal day-1 and 7 g animal day-1) achieved the same degree of carcass finishing, higher than the control group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41012/29671,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Effect of grazing management strategies on the yield and nutritional value of Marandu grass in the semiarid of Brazil,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two grazing management strategies on structural, productive and nutritional parameters of Marandu grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu). A completely randomized block design with two pasture management strategies and eight replications (blocks) was used. The grazing management strategies were: (1) low intensity rotational grazing (LI), with a pre-grazing sward height of 40 cm and a post-grazing sward height of 24 cm, i.e., a defoliation intensity of 50%; (2) High intensity rotational grazing (HI), with a pre-grazing sward height of 40 cm and a post-grazing sward height of 10 cm (±70% defoliation intensity). Pastures were sampled before and after grazing for estimation of forage mass, forage accumulation rate, structural characteristics, nutritional value and dry matter intake. The LI strategy resulted in higher dry matter production than HI before (18.33%) and after grazing (49.06%), increasing pre-grazing forage density by 13.21% (P < 0.05). The production of potentially digestible dry matter was highest (P < 0.05) in LI strategy (21.3% before and 39.6% after grazing, respectively). Higher post-grazing green forage mass (45%) increased the residual crude protein in LI.

Eighteen Mangalarga Marchador foals were randomly divided into two groups in the post-weaning phase, with nine animals each in the control group (CG) and the group receiving protein supplementation (WG). Based on 4% of their body weight (BW), the CG animals received a diet with roughage to concentrate in a ratio of 50:50, which composed of Cynodon sp. hay and a 15% crude protein (CP) commercial horse ration. The WG diet consisted of the same amount of hay used for the CG diet, half the amount of concentrate used in the CG diet, and 102 g of a protein supplement containing whey protein, glutamine, and lysine. During the experiment, five evaluations were performed, starting on the day of weaning (day 0), followed by evaluations conducted at 7, 14, 28, and 42 days after weaning. Body measurements, body mass, and thickness of the fat and muscle layers were assessed at each time point. The substitution of a portion of the commercial diet with protein supplement containing whey protein, glutamine, and lysine did not cause changes in the weight gain or linear measurements of Mangalarga Marchador foals during the post-weaning period; however, the change in diet increased muscle thickness and decreased fat thickness when compared to animals in the control group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41249/29694,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Nutritional management and sexual condition in cattle determine differentiation in the fatty acid profile of meat,"This study aimed at evaluating the fatty acid profile of meat from feedlot finished heifers and steers fed with high-grain diets. It was used 45 Charolais and Nellore crossbred cattle, 21 of them were heifers with an initial age of 32 ± 2 months and 359.9 ± 6.7 kg of body weight, and 24 were steers with an initial age of 20 ± 2 months and 337.6 ± 6.2 kg of body weight. The animals were distributed in the treatments according to the energy source used in the diet, being them: rice, white oats or corn, using seven heifers and eight steers for each diet. The experimental design was completely randomized, with factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (three treatments and two sexual conditions). The diet based on corn provided higher levels of pentadecylic and margaric fatty acids. Excepting elaidic fatty acid, beef from steers and heifers was similar for the different saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids evaluated. A rice-based diet is advantageous when meat production is recommended with greater participation of fatty acids from the omega-3 group. When finished in feedlot with high-grain diets, the heifers produce meat with higher conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content and a better ratio between omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids compared to steers. These findings indicate that it is possible to modify undesirable characteristics in meat through the nutritional management of animals, searching for a product that meets the requirements of a modern population, which is redefining its principles regarding food.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40993/29670,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Sperm filtration as an alternative technique for seminal plasma separation in boars,"The present study aimed to evaluate the filtration for separating seminal plasma of boars’ ejaculate by means of sperm viability and the occurrence of hyperactivation and lipid peroxidation in fresh semen and after cooling for up to 96 hours. The ejaculate of eight healthy boars of different breeds was collected and the gelatinous portion was separated and discarded. In the laboratory, the semen was fractioned into three aliquots (groups G1, G2 and G3) as follows: G1: semen with plasma diluted in BTS (TOTAL BTS); G2: semen centrifuged at 600G/10’ (BTS CEN); and G3: semen filtered with the Sperm-filter® following dilution of the retained cells with BTS (BTS FIL). The analyses were performed at three moments: with fresh samples (D0) and after 48 (D2) and 96 hours (D4) of cooling at 17ºC. The kinetic evaluation was performed using the CASA system, which provided data for the classification of sperm hyperactivity. For lipid stress analysis, the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) test was performed. The variance analysis test was conducted to compare the results between the groups and moments analyzed. The results showed better total motility values (%) for G1 at D0 (67.9, P= 0.001), D2 (36.6, P= 0.004) and D4 (26.1, P= 0.003). The occurrence of hyperactivity was observed in G2 and G3 at moments D2 and D4. In addition, TBARS showed higher peroxidation levels for G1 at D0 (8.1 mM MDA/ml, P= 0.01), D2 (7.4 mM MDA/ml, P= 0.02), and D4 (6.41mMol MDA/ml, P= 0.008) when compared to G2 and G3. Since the filtration method did not demonstrate any damage to the sperm viability, the study concluded that sperm filtration is an accessible and valid tool to replace centrifugation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41924/29669,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Prevalence and level of infection by endoparasites in different categories of sheep in the Western Amazon,"This study aimed to understand the epidemiology of the main gastrointestinal endoparasites affecting sheep raised in the municipality of Sena Madureira, Acre, Brazil. A total of 178 fecal samples were collected from sheep raised in an extensive system of 10 farms. The samples were grouped into lambs, ewe lambs, lambing ewes, ewes, and rams for laboratory analysis by the flotation technique for counting eggs per gram of feces (EGF), oocysts of Eimeria sp., and presence of eggs of Moniezia sp. The analyzed variables consisted of the prevalence of nematodes, cestodes, and coccidia and intensity of strongylid and coccidium infection by quantification (mean ± SE) of eggs and oocysts. Prevalence data were compared by the chi-square test and intensity of infection (mean ± SE) by the Scott-Knott test (SAEG 9.1), both with P < 0.05. The overall prevalence was 77.6%, reaching 64.15% for strongylids, 36.2% for coccidia, and 8.81% for cestodes (Moniezia sp.). Ewes had the lowest prevalence (52.5%), while lambs had a prevalence of 95.5%, not differing from the others (P < 0.05). The intensity of infection by nematodes showed that lambs had the highest EGF compared to ewes, with values of 1297±270 and 232±79, respectively. The categories lambing ewes, ewes, and rams presented an average EGF below what is indicated for treatment with drugs. The highest intensity of infection was observed for ewe lambs (5859±3648), exceeding acceptable rates. Sheep raised in Sena Madureira has a high prevalence for verminosis by strongylids and a low prevalence for coccidiosis and cestodiasis. Young animal categories present a high health risk for endoparasitoses, and management measures that collaborate with the prophylaxis and control of these diseases should be adopted.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41861/29667,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study aimed to determine the incidence of Mycoplasma gallisepticum and M. synoviae in broiler flocks at the Federal District and its surrounding regions using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All slaughtered lots (57 flocks) were analyzed from July to November in one of the two slaughterhouses at the Federal District with Federal inspection services. Approximately 10 samples of broiler tracheae per slaughtered batch were collected from the evisceration line. The results obtained from the accumulated incidence over the study period were 7.02% and 35.09% for M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae, respectively. A greater concentration of flocks affected by M. synoviae was observed during October. The sample design as well as the PCR technique assisted in detecting both agents in the broiler batches in the first epidemiological study of these two agents in the region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41871/29666,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Effect of vaccination on the apparent prevalence of bovine brucellosis in the state of Tocantins, Brazil","A cross-sectional study on the epidemiological situation of bovine brucellosis was carried out in the state of Tocantins to evaluate the effectiveness of its vaccination program. The state was divided into five regions, and a predetermined number of farms was randomly selected in each one. Females aged 24 months or older were randomly selected in each farm and diagnosed with brucellosis by serial serology (AAT and 2-ME). A total of 6,846 animals from 756 farms were examined. The prevalence of seropositive herds in the state was 6.42% [CI95%: 4.76-8.62], and the prevalence of seropositive animals was 2.21% [CI95%: 1.05-4.01]. The prevalence of seropositive herds was homogeneously distributed among regions. The 2002/2003 study estimated the prevalence of seropositive herds in the state to be 21.22% [CI95%: 19.33-23.11]. In conclusion, the vaccination program implemented in Tocantins, reaching vaccination coverage above 70% as of 2010, significantly reduced the prevalence of seropositive herds. Thus, continuing the vaccination program in the state is recommended, preferably increasing the quality of the processes involved, from commercialization to inoculation in animals, since immunization remains the most effective means to reduce the prevalence of brucellosis. In addition, animal replacement remains a major risk factor for bovine brucellosis in Tocantins since 20022003; therefore, the state must implement a strong health education program explaining to farmers the importance of testing animals for brucellosis before introducing them into their herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41566/29665,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Application of hormonal subdoses at the Bai Hui acupoint for estrus synchronization in sheep,"Here, the efficiency of applying subdoses of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and prostaglandin F2 alfa (PGF2alfa) at the Bai Hui (BH) acupoint for estrus synchronization in sheep was evaluated. Thirty Santa Inês ewes received intravaginal sponges containing 60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate for 7 days. The animals were divided into five treatments (T) (n=6): T1 (control), 132.5 ug PGF2 alfa (100% of dose) and 300 IU eCG (100% of dose), both intramuscularly (IM); T2, 39.75 ug PGF2 alfa (30% of dose) at the BH acupoint and 300 IU eCG (100% of dose) IM; T3, 132.5 ug PGF2 alfa (100% of dose) IM and 90 IU eCG (30% of dose) at the BH acupoint; T4, 39.75 ug PGF2 alfa (30% of dose) and 90 IU eCG (30% of dose), both at the BH acupoint; and T5, 39.75 ug PGF2 alfa (30% of dose) and 90 IU eCG (30% of dose) both at a false acupoint (IM, at the same location as in T1). After 12 h of sponge removal and hormone application, the ewes were subjected to monitoring for estrus and mating and ultrasound assessments of follicular growth and ovulation time every 12 h. The data were evaluated for normality and subjected to analysis of variance, considering a 5% probability. There were no differences in the percentage of animals in estrus (93.3±9.1%), interval from sponge removal to estrus onset (48.1±6.0 h), interval from sponge removal to estrus end (69.6±5.4 h), duration of estrus (24.0±4.7 h), interval from sponge removal to ovulation (73.7±5.9 h), interval from estrus onset to ovulation (26.5±2.3 h), size of the largest follicle (6.7±0.4 mm), follicular growth rate (0.8±0.1 mm•day-1), number of ovulations (1.3±0.1), and plasma progesterone levels 7 days after ovulation (9.6±2.0 ng•mL-1). The cost of the synchronization protocol per animal was US$ 4.37, 4.12, 2.96, 2.71, and 2.71 for T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively, with 37.99% cost reduction using PGF2 alfa and eCG at 30% of the conventional doses. Therefore, the application of reduced PGF2 alfa (39.75 ug) and eCG (90 IU) doses at the BH or false acupoint effectively synchronized estrus and reduced protocol cost in sheep, indicating that the conventional doses are overestimated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40913/29663,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Anthelmintic activity of the ethanolic extract of Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae) on gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep in the Western Amazon,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of energy supplementation on associative effects between forage and concentrate supplements and on the performance of beef cattle on a tropical pasture during the rainy season. Twenty-eight Nellore bulls averaging 19 months of age and 325.2 ± 4.1 kg were allotted to a completely randomized design and distributed into four paddocks of two hectares each with a tropical pasture for 84 d. The treatments consisted of bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture without concentrate supplementation or bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture receiving concentrate supplementation at 15 (S15), 30 (S30) or 45% (S45) of the total digestible nutrients (TDN) requirement. All bulls had ad libitum access to mineral supplementation. The amount and chemical composition of the supplement were adjusted every 28 d. Forage and supplement intakes were evaluated in all animals using fecal markers. Crude protein: digestible organic matter ratio decreased with supplementation; consequently, the imbalance between dietary protein and energy increased. Forage intake decreased with increasing supplementation. The substitution rates of pasture for supplementary feed were 0.14, 0.33, and 0.46 for bulls from S15, S30, and S45 treatments, respectively. However, the apparent DM digestibility increased linearly with supplementation level. Supplementation improved the assimilation of ammonia-N in the rumen. Energy supplementation for Nellore bulls on tropical pastures during the rainy season provides excess energy relative to protein, resulting in a substitution effect of supplement intake on forage intake. Moreover, energy supplementation does not improve body weight gain. Protein sources should be added to supplements for balancing protein and energy levels, thereby reducing a likely substitution effect.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41424/29693,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Functional potential and food safety of fresh-cut ‘Paluma’ guava under edible coatings,"Guava is a fruit rich in antioxidants and its value can be enhanced by fresh-cut processing, which increases convenience for consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in bioactive compounds, total antioxidant activity (TAA) and microbial quality in slices of fresh-cut (FC) ‘Paluma’ guava coated with chitosan at 2% (Q), calcium chloride at 1% (CC), calcium chloride at 1% + sodium alginate at 1% (CC + A), calcium chloride at 1% + chitosan at 2% (CC + Q), and control (T - without coating). Coated slices were packed in trays, wrapped with PVC film and kept at 3 ± 1 °C and 75 ± 4% RH for 12 days and evaluated for ascorbic acid, lycopene, beta-carotene, total extractable polyphenols (TEP), and TAA by ABTS+- and DPPH . Ascorbic acid content of slices did not differ by coatings, but TEP was higher in slices coated with Q. The TAA by DPPH was higher in slices coated with Q, however, by ABTS + - it was higher in those coated with Q, CC and CC + Q. No thermotolerant coliforms or Salmonella were detected in FC guava from any treatment. However, slices coated with Q showed the lowest counts of total coliforms and molds and yeasts. Therefore, the application of Q coating provided microbiological safety to FC guava, still maintaining the levels of bioactive compounds and TAA superior to the control slices, which can characterize this as a healthy FC product, with superior functional potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42016/29660,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Influencing factors for preparation of platelet-rich plasma in horses,"There is no consensus in the literature as to the best platelet-rich plasma (PRP) acquisition method or the ideal platelet concentration to stimulate tissue repair. Besides that, most studies do not provide a clear and replicable description of the methods used, which makes standardization and result comparison difficult. Thus, this study aimed to accurately describe the method and evaluate factors influencing PRP preparation in equines. In this regard, two protocols were used, P1 and P2, based on two centrifugation methods, which differed in blood volume, speed and time, and platelet pipetting and resuspension. In conclusion, factors such as centrifugation strength and time are essential to obtain PRP with adequate platelet count. However, other factors such as tube type and plasma pipetting and resuspension methods directly interfere with the replicability of the technique, and hence influencing PRP applicability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39503/29661,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Comparison of urinary protein-to-creatinine ration, serum albumin, serum creatinine and systolic arterial blood pressure of glomerular injury cases in dogs with chronic kidney disease","This study aims at assessing the prevalence of glomerular alterations in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and comparing the clinical and laboratory parameters. The tests conducted include a double-blind histopathological assay conducted by two pathologists, urine tests including inactive sediment, urinary protein-to-creatinine (UPC), serum albumin and serum creatinine, as well as measurement of the systolic arterial blood pressure. The prevalence of glomerular injuries was determined and the predominant injury was compared with a group comprised of the remaining injuries. The study included 24 dogs with CKD. The results revealed a predominance of membranous glomerular alterations 17/24 (70,83%), followed by glomerulosclerosis 3/24 (12,50%), membranoproliferative injuries 2/24, glomerulocystic atrophy 1/24 and glomerular amyloidosis 1/24. Amyloidosis presented the highest UPC while the membranoproliferative injury presented the lowest mean concentration of serum albumin. Higher values in the UPC did not correspond with lower mean serum albumin values. Glomerulosclerosis presented the highest mean systolic blood pressure and glomerular atrophy presented the highest creatinine values. When comparing membranous injuries with a group comprised of the remaining injuries, the UPC did not present significant differences between the groups. Renal amyloidosis was included in the group with the lowest systolic arterial blood pressure values while membranoproliferative injury was included in the group with highest UPC. The group called “others” presented the highest creatinine value. Dogs with CKD may present several types of glomerular injuries with similar clinical and laboratory profiles. This study observed a predominance of membranous glomerular injuries, followed by membranoproliferative injuries, glomerulocystic atrophy and amyloidosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40384/29662,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Blends of cassava starch with banana flours as raw materials for gluten-free biscuits,"The growth in demand for gluten-free products linked mainly to health aspects has led to an increased interest in the production of mixed flours for use in bakery products. This work aimed to evaluate the use of different mixtures of cassava starch with banana flour, obtained from the pulp and peel of green fruits, for the production of gluten-free biscuits. In the preparation of the biscuits, seven mixtures were prepared with varying percentages of cassava starch, banana pulp flour and banana peel flour. A formulation with wheat flour was used as a control. Wheat flour, cassava starch and banana flours were analyzed for chemical composition. The results showed that the banana peel flour stood out for its higher levels of proteins, fibres, lipids, ash, total phenols, total flavonoids and antioxidant activity which make this flour effective as a functional additive. However, the results of physical and sensory characteristics of the biscuits showed that the variation in the percentage of banana peel flour led to greater changes in the quality attributes of the biscuits, so the percentage of inclusion should be limited. Banana pulp flour (UBF) had high starch content, however, the biscuits produced with higher percentages of this flour and lower percentages of cassava starch showed lower propagation rates, greater hardness and less sensory acceptance, showing the importance of the starchy raw material in the physical properties of biscuits. Formulations containing cassava starch mixed with up to 15% banana flour (1:1, pulp and peel) are a good basis for making gluten-free biscuits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41943/29659,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Energy efficiency in maize crops in different regions of Brazil,"Assessment of energy efficiency (EE) enables the evaluation of the sustainability of agrosystems, as well as decision-making regarding reduction in production costs and environmental pollution and even to increase production in a sustainable way. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess energy efficiency in maize in different regions of Brazil. For this purpose, 32 areas of maize crop distributed across the major producing states and regions were assessed. Energy inputs and outputs of agricultural operations and/or agricultural inputs were calculated by multiplying the amount used by their calorific value or energy coefficient at each stage of production. Energy efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the total output energy and the total input energy during the production process. For every megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed in the production of second-crop maize and first-crop maize seasons, 9.9 and 8.7 MJ respectively of renewable energy were produced in the form of grain. In both maize cropping seasons, most of the energy use was attributed to fertilizers, herbicides and fuel. To be representative the evaluation of energy efficiency of the maize crop should be performed in different Brazilian cultivation regions, as it will represent different edaphoclimatic and management conditions spread over the national territory within an agricultural year.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42214/29658,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Foliar application of H2O2 as salt stress attenuator in ‘BRS Rubi do Cerrado’ sour passion fruit,"Irrigation with saline water causes a reduction in yield, especially in semi-arid regions. Cultivation strategies have been developed to mitigate salt stress on plants, such as the use of hydrogen peroxide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attenuating effect of hydrogen peroxide on the gas exchange and growth of ‘BRS Rubi do Cerrado’ sour passion fruit cultivated under irrigation with saline water. The design was completely randomized in split-plot plots, with water salinity levels ECw (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.0 dS m-1) considered the plots and the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 (0, 15, 30, and 45 uM) considered the subplots, with three replicates. Gas exchange (stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, instantaneous water use efficiency, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency), and absolute and relative growth rates in stem diameter were evaluated. An increase in irrigation water salinity from 0.6 dS m-1 reduced gas exchange, and exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide did not promote a significant effect on gas exchange. However, foliar application of hydrogen peroxide at 15 uM increased the growth of ‘BRS Rubi do Cerrado’ sour passion fruit.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42169/29657,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Propagation of ‘Bruno’ kiwifruit: influence of cutting collection time and indolebutyric acid,"In Brazil, the propagation of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is achieved through seed-derived rootstocks, which results in low uniformity. An alternative to address this problem is the cuttings technique, a simple and fast method that generates individuals identical to the parent plant, maintaining the agronomic traits. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of cutting collection time and indolebutyric acid (IBA) on the rooting of 'Bruno' kiwifruit cuttings. The cuttings were collected in the months of May, August and December 2016 and March 2017 and treated with 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg L -1 IBA, as a hydroalcoholic solution, for seven seconds. After 90 days, the percentages of rooted and dead cuttings and cuttings that produced shoots; leaf retention; average length of the three largest roots; average number of primary roots per cutting; and reserve contents before and after rooting were evaluated. The treatments with IBA influenced the rooting of cuttings collected in May, which showed 36.07% rooting at the calculated IBA concentration of 2,320 mg L -1, and in December, which exhibited 57.59% rooting at the concentration of 4000 mg L -1.

42,2021,Yield and physiological quality of wheat seeds produced under different irrigation depths and leaf Silicon,"Water availability is one of the main factors responsible for wheat productivity, as well as the quality of the produced seeds. Silicon (Si) has an important role in mitigating the effects of various biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, Si application can be used to mitigate the effects of different irrigation depths on the production and quality of wheat seeds. The work aimed to evaluate the yield and physiological quality of wheat seeds produced from plants fertilized with leaf Si and grown under different irrigation depths. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot randomized block design, with four replications. The plots consisted of three irrigation depths (0, 50, and 100% of the total irrigation requirement [TIR]). Si treatments were allocated (without application [0 mM] and 5 mM SiO2, applied at the tillering stage) in the subplots. The following parameters were evaluated: water balance of the system; soil moisture; yield; thousand seed weight; germination; electrical conductivity; accelerated aging; seedling length and emergence. The water balance of the system was negative for the 0% TIN irrigation depth after anthesis and there was less soil moisture in this irrigation depth. There was no effect of irrigation depths and Si application on plant yield. The smaller irrigation depths imposed reduced the thousand seed weight and increased the electrical conductivity of the seeds produced. Plants fertilized with Si did not differ in germination, but they produced more vigorous seedlings with greater growth and uniformity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42168/29724,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Spatio-temporal variability of biophysical parameters of irrigated maize using orbital remote sensing,"This study proposes to estimate the actual crop evapotranspiration, using the SAFER model, as well as calculate the crop coefficient (Kc) as a function of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and determine the biomass of an irrigated maize crop using images from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared (TIRS) sensors of the Landsat-8 satellite. Pivots 21 to 26 of a commercial farm located in the municipalities of Bom Jesus da Lapa and Serra do Ramalho, west of Bahia State, Brazil, were selected. Sowing dates for each pivot were arranged as North and South or East and West, with cultivation starting firstly in one of the orientations and subsequently in the other. The relationship between NDVI and the Kc values obtained in the FAO-56 report (KcFAO) revealed a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.7921), showing that the variance of KcFAO can be explained by NDVI in the maize crop. Considering the center pivots with different planting dates, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) pixel values ranged from 0.0 to 6.0 mm d-1 during the phenological cycle. The highest values were found at 199 days of the year (DOY), corresponding to around 100 days after sowing (DAS). The lowest BIO values occur at 135 DOY, at around 20 DAS. There is a relationship between ETc and BIO, where the DOY with the highest BIO are equivalent to the days with the highest ETc values. In addition to this relationship, BIO is strongly influenced by soil water availability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41948/29653,E-ISSN 1679-0359

An experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with a 3×2 factorial arrangement (three cultivars: Triunfo, Garapiá and FC 104; two water regimes: irrigated and non-irrigated) with 25 replicates each. A total of 523 trifoliates were collected throughout the crop cycle. The length (L, cm) and width (W, cm) of the central leaflet of the trifoliate were measured and their product (LW) (cm²) calculated. Then, the leaf area of these trifoliates was determined by digital photography methods using ImageJ® software, and using leaf discs. The number of samples required to estimate the leaf area of a trifoliate was determined to define which method is the most accurate to be used as the real leaf area in generating equations to estimate the leaf area in common bean. The relationship between area by digital photographs and the dimensions of the central leaflet of the trifoliate (L, W and LW) was fitted by linear, quadratic and power models. Subsequently, the predictive capacity of the equations was assessed by the root mean square error (cm2 trifoliate-1), mean absolute error (cm2 trifoliate-1), index of agreement and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Sample size varied between cultivars, water regimes and evaluation methods. It is more appropriate to use the leaf area provided by ImageJ® as real for comparison purposes in generating models to estimate leaf area from linear measurements, in common bean. The general equation LA = 1.092L1.945 can be used in the tested regimes without accuracy losses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41724/29651,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Morphological characterization of remaining specimens of the Curraleiro horse in Central Brazil,"This study aimed to carry out the morphological characterization of the remaining specimens of the Curraleiro horse in municipalities of the state of Goiás, Brazil. Forty male horses were evaluated using the age of five years as a criterion. Sixteen linear measurements and 13 zootechnical indices were obtained. Subsequently, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and covariances of these measures and indices were obtained using the software IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows. The measures withers height (WH), croup height (CH), midback height (MH), sternum-to-ground height (SH), chest index (CI), and estimated weight (W) allowed characterizing Curraleiro horses as small-sized, light, and fast, with proportional measures. The dactyl-thoracic index (DTI), body index (BI), conformation index (CFI), load index 1 and 2 (LOI1 and LOI2), and compactness index 1 and 2 (COI1 and COI2) showed that the Curraleiro horse has an intermediate capacity for speed and strength, bearing considerable weight on the back, with saddling aptitude and fast work. These results represent the beginning of the formation of a database that may contribute to future studies and the conservation of the Curraleiro horse in the state of Goiás.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43348/30623,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Fat content in fermented milk beverages: determination by the Gerber method,"Fermented milk beverage is a product containing milk, whey and/or other ingredients, fermented by specific microorganisms and/or added with fermented milks. Fat determination in this product is important to quality control and inspection. The Gerber method is used worldwide as a simple and rapid method for fat content analysis in raw and processed milks. In Brazil, Roese-Gottlieb is the official method for analysis of fat content in milk beverages. However, the use of Gerber method for fat content determination in fermented milk beverages is widespread throughout the industry in the country. Several authors have tested the use of Gerber method for some dairy products, but there is no report on this evaluation for fermented milk beverages. In this context, the objectives of this work were to determine the fat content of fermented milk beverages by the Gerber method and evaluate the performance of this test, using Roese-Gottlieb as a reference method. Thirty samples of fermented milk beverages were analyzed by both methods. The fat contents ranged from 1.25 to 2.40% by the Gerber method and from 1.24 to 2.50% by the Roese-Gottlieb method. There was no difference (p > 0.05) between the methods. The Gerber method can be used to determine the fat content of fermented milk beverages, without prejudice to the results obtained.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43412/30601,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Does elevated CO2 affect the biological aspects of Liriomyza sativae in melon plants?,"An increase in the carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) in the atmosphere has occurred in recent years, influencing the different biological aspects of herbivorous insects. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CO2 increase on the biological aspects of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard leafminer in melon plants. For this, two experiments were carried out: (i) to evaluate the effect of melon plants grown in CO2-enriched environments on the immature developmental stages of L. sativae and L. sativae adult longevity, and (ii) to verify the impact of increased CO2 concentration on L. sativae adult survival, feeding punctures, and oviposition. The experiments were carried out in growth chambers maintained in the temperature regime of 20-26-33 °C (simulating the minimum, average, and maximum daily temperature) and under two CO2 concentrations (400 ppm and 770 ppm).The immature stages and the egg-adult period of L. sativae were longer when they were grown on plants grown in high CO2 levels (770 ppm), but no difference in adult longevity was observed. The viability of the immature phases was not different between the two CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of eggs and feeding punctures between treatments. Thus, the increase in CO2 concentration prolongs the duration of the immature stages of L. sativae; however, it does not affect their viability. Adult survival, fertility, and feeding punctures were also unmodified by the environment enriched with CO2.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40921/29650,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Application of chemical compounds during pre-harvesting to control post-harvesting green mold in citrus,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of system-acquired resistance inducing compounds applied during the pre-harvest of ‘Navelina’ orange and ‘Ortanique’ tangor in controlling post-harvest disease caused by Penicillium digitatum. The products applied were acibenzolar-s-methyl (ASM), imidacloprid (IMI), methyl jasmonate (MeJa), sodium selenite, potassium silicate, and thiamethoxam (TMT). Sterile distilled water was used as the control. The applications were administered 45, 30, and 15 days before harvesting. In 2015 and 2016, 840 fruits were randomly collected, and when they reached commercial maturation, they were sanitized, half were pierced with a needle in the equatorial region. The fruits were inoculated with a 10 µL spore suspension (1 × 106 conidia mL-1) of P. digitatum, in the equatorial region. The experiment was performed with three replicates, each comprising 10 fruits and repeated over two consecutive crop seasons. Disease incidence was evaluated on pierced (at 72 and 144 h after inoculation [hai]) and unperforated (at 360 hai) fruits. For pierced fruits, lesion expansion rate (rL), disease severity, expansion rate of sporulating area (rE), and sporulating area were evaluated. The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the area under the sporulating area progress curve were calculated. Both cultivars were susceptible; however, the rL and rE had lower values for 'Ortanique'. The tested products reduced the disease incidence in both cultivars. Potassium silicate reduced rL and rE, whereas sodium selenite reduced rE. The disease severity was reduced by potassium silicate, sodium selenite, and ASM. AUDPC was reduced by sodium selenite and potassium silicate treatments. Among the tested products, potassium silicate and sodium selenite applied during the pre-harvest of 'Navelina' orange and 'Ortanique' tangor had the highest reductions for disease incidence (ranging from 14% to 37%, respectively) and severity (60% and 70%, respectively), rE (50% for both compounds), and total sporulating area (55% and 56%, respectively), reducing the green mold in post-harvested fruits caused by P. digitatum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40263/29649,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Hemotropic mycoplasmas in bats from forest fragments, state of Paraná, southern Brazil","The order Chiroptera is the second largest group of mammals with bats being identified as reservoir of several viral zoonoses, although, little is known about their role in other groups of pathogens, including hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. To date, hemoplasma species have been found infecting several species of bats with high genetic diversity between 16S rRNA gene sequences. On this study, we aimed to identify the occurrence and characterize 16S and 23S rRNA genes of hemoplasma species in four bats species (Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium and Sturnira tildae) from forest fragments in Paraná State, southern Brazil, using PCR-based assays. Spleen tissue samples were collected, DNA extracted and further screened by a pan hemoplasma PCR assay. All samples consistently amplified the mammal endogenous gapdh gene. One out of 15 (6.66%; 95% CI: 0.2-31%) bats tested positive for hemotropic Mycoplasma sp. by the PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragment from the hemoplasma-positive bat showed 99.14% identity with hemotropic Mycoplasma sp. detected in Sturnira parvidens from Belize. Sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene fragment from the hemoplasma-positive bat showed 86.17% identity with Candidatus Mycoplasma haemosphiggurus’ detected in orange spined hairy dwarf porcupines (Sphiggurus villosus) from Southern Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44452/30593,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Preparation of tambacu protein concentrates using different methodologies,"The aim of this study was to develop methodologies to obtain fish protein concentrates from tambacu filleting residues, characterize their physical-chemical composition and evaluate their sensory profile. Concentrates were prepared by one of three methodologies: cooking of the raw material and subsequent drying (FPC1); cooking, drying, lipid removal with ethanol at 70 °C and final drying (FPC2); and three washing steps of the raw material with ethanol at 70 °C and drying (FPC3). FPC2 had a lower final yield (15.5%) and chroma a* (1.77) and chroma b* values (14.12) but higher moisture (5.22%) and protein content (80.39%) and luminosity (74.97), in addition to having the weakest fish taste compared to FPC1 and FPC3. FPC1 had the strongest odour, darkest colour, and strongest fish taste compared to FPC2 and FPC3. Ash, pH values, and water activity were not different between the concentrates. It is concluded that the methodology where lipid removal steps are carried out after cooking and drying (FPC2) is more effective for the removal of lipids and deodorization of tambacu protein concentrate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44318/30598,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Effects of salinity and plant-based diet or animal-plant combination diet on the performance and metabolic status of juvenile Nile tilapia,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of salinity and plant-based diet or animal-plant combination diet on the performance and metabolic status of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The experimental design was completely randomized in a 4 × 2 factorial scheme with four replicates. The treatments were established by the combination of salinities of 0, 10, 20, and 30 g L-1 with an animal-plant combination diet (AP) or plant-based diet (P). The replicates were 60 L tanks with 12 fish per tank. Diets were provided for 32 days, and the fish were fed three times a day (8, 12, and 17 h) until apparent satiety. Daily feed intake (DFI) was measured, body weight (BW) was recorded at the beginning and end of the trial, and total length (TL) and standard length (SL) were measured at the end of the trial. Average daily gain (ADG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and survival rate were calculated. After the biometric measurements were made at the end of the trial, blood samples were collected to determine the plasma concentrations of total protein (TP), glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). The fish were euthanized, and the hepatopancreas was collected and weighed; thereafter, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) was calculated. An interaction was detected between salinity and diet type for final BW, ADG, TL, and SL. These traits were not influenced by salinity when it was associated with the AP diet, but reduced linearly with salinity in the P diet. DFI and survival rate were independently affected by salinity: DFI reduced linearly with salinity levels and survival rate was higher at a salinity of 10 g L-1. HSI increased linearly with salinity levels and was lower in the P diet than in the AP diet. Salinity had a quadratic effect on plasma TP, and the maximum value for this metabolite (2.96 g dL-1) is attained at a salinity of 10.26 g L-1. There was an independent effect of diet on the plasma concentrations of cholesterol and TG, which were lower in the P diet than in the AP diet. The salinity of 10 g L-1 associated with diet composed of animal and plant ingredients led to a better performance, higher survival rate, and less stressful environmental conditions for juvenile Nile tilapia.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44012/30588,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Assessment of the drinker type on water intake and toy type on behaviour of nursery piglets,"This study was conducted to assess the effect of two types of drinkers on water intake (WI) and two types of toys on behavioural observations of piglets in the nursery phase. A total of 72 crossbred entire male piglets (Landrace × Large White, Agroceres and DanBred), weaned at 21 days of age, with an average initial body weight (AIBW) of 6.75 ± 0.19 kg were used. Two statistical models were fitted for WI. In model I, animals were distributed in a completely randomized design (CRD) with a split-plot in time, composed of six treatments (2 types of drinkers × 3 experimental phases), eight replications (days of sampling), and 36 animals/experimental unit (EU), without using AIBW as a covariate. In model II, animals were distributed in a CRD with two treatments (fixed or pendular nipple drinkers), eight replications (days of sampling) and 36 animals/EU, with use of AIBW as a covariate. For assessment of behavioural observations, the model was adjusted in a randomized block design, consisting of four treatments [two types of toys (metal chain and plastic bottle) × two daytime periods (morning and afternoon)], nine replications and three blocks constituted in time (days), totalling four pigs/EU. The results indicated an effect on animal daily WI in the starter phase in model I (p < 0.000) and II (p = 0.006). There was an effect (p smaller 0.05) of toy type for behavioural observations, in which pigs showed a greater proportion of fighting and belly nosing when they had the bottle toy. However, animals spent more time (p smaller 0.05) eating, drinking water, overlapping, and playing with the toy when they had access to the chain toy. There was an increase (p smaller 0.05) in sleeping behaviour in the morning period, as well as greater (p smaller 0.05) behavioural activity in the afternoon period. In conclusion, WI of nursery piglets was positively influenced by growth phase, and the fixed drinker stimulated greater WI in piglets in the starter phase. In addition, the metal chain, as an environmental enrichment, promoted improvements in feeding behaviour and WI, reducing fighting events, and the afternoon period had increased behavioural observations overall.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44078/30573,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Modified hydroponics and phenolic foam as technological innovations in the production of coffee seedlings from cuttings,"A produção brasileira de café representa uma importante atividade no setor agrícola do país e, por isso, requer tecnologias inovadoras para a produção de mudas, um dos mais importantes insumos na implantação das lavouras. Assim, a clonagem de plantas por estaquia, a nutrição mineral via hidroponia modificada e o uso de substratos alternativos aparecem como inovações tecnológicas para a produção de mudas. O presente estudo avaliou a produção de mudas clonais de café em sistema hidropônico modificado em comparação ao sistema convencional de estufa de clima controlado, utilizando vermiculita e espuma fenólica como substratos alternativos. Ao final do experimento, as mudas foram analisadas quanto ao crescimento (altura, diâmetro do caule, número total de folhas, área foliar, área radicular, matéria seca da parte aérea e da raiz) e fisiológicas (teor de clorofila e condutância estomática). Para a análise estatística, foi utilizado o delineamento inteiramente casualizado (CRD) em esquema fatorial 2 (tipos de substrato) x 2 (sistemas de cultivo) com seis repetições e dez plantas por parcela. O inovador sistema hidropônico modificado leva a um maior crescimento das mudas de café produzidas por estacas em tubetes com vermiculita em relação às produzidas nos sistemas convencionais. O substrato “espuma fenólica” pode ser utilizado alternativamente no sistema de estufa com ar condicionado.

43,2022,Application of abscisic acid (S-ABA) at different stages of ripening on color development of ‘Rubi’ table grape,"The color of the berries is an important aspect of the quality of table grapes and crucial for marketing. The ‘Rubi’ table grapes grown in the subtropical climate generally lack color intensity due to the inhibition of anthocyanins by high temperatures during ripening. The exogenous application of abscisic acid (S-ABA) can be used to overcome this problem as the accumulation of anthocyanins in the berry skin is regulated by this plant growth regulator. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the exogenous application of S-ABA at different stages of ripening on color development in ‘Rubi’ table grapes using the soluble solids (SS) content as a marker of ripening. The study was conducted during two seasons in commercial vineyards. The first trial was conducted in Marialva, Parana, Brazil, during the 2019 summer season crop (harvest in December). S-ABA (400 mg L-1) was exogenously applied at different stages of ripening of ‘Rubi’ table grapes (determined by the SS content of the berries): control (without application); SS = 8-9 ºBrix; SS = 10-11 ºBrix; SS = 8-9 ºBrix (two applications; the second one applied 10 days after the first); and SS = 10-11 ºBrix (two applications; the second one applied 10 days after the first). The second trial was conducted in Cambira, Parana, Brazil, during the 2020 off-season crop (harvest in May). S-ABA (400 mg L-1) was exogenously applied at different stages of ripening of Rubi grapes: control (without application); SS = 6-7 ºBrix; SS = 7-8 ºBrix; SS = 9-10 ºBrix; SS = 6-7 ºBrix (two applications; the second one applied 14 days after the first); SS = 7-8 ºBrix (two applications; the second one applied 14 days after the first); and SS = 9-10 ºBrix (two applications; the second one applied 14 days after the first). A randomized block design was used as the statistical model with four replications, and each plot consisted of one vine. The variables analyzed were total anthocyanin contents, color index (CIRG), and color attributes (L*, C*, h°, and deltaE) of berry skin. The total anthocyanin accumulation and color attributes of the berries were evaluated every 10 and 7 days after the first application of S-ABA until harvest in the first and second trials, respectively, and the other variables were evaluated at harvest. In the summer-season crop, when the SS content was 8-11 ºBrix, the application of S-ABA increased the concentration of the total anthocyanins 4 times compared to that in the control, improving berry color development. Furthermore, in the off-season crop, when the SS content was 6-10 ºBrix, the application of S-ABA increased the concentration of total anthocyanins 2-3 times compared to that in the control, improving the color attributes of berries. In both crops, a single application of the plant growth regulator was sufficient to intensify the color of the berries.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43594/30557,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,"Occurrence and distribution of lace bug, whitefly, and shoot fly pest species on cassava (Manihot esculenta) crops according to region in Paraná State, Brazil","The cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) crop is relevant for human livelihoods, particularly in poorer regions. It is consumed fresh or as industrialized flour, and the roots and aerial parts are also used to feed livestock. Pests may limit cassava production, which may endanger food security due to the socioeconomic importance of the crop. Reports of the occurrence of three insect guilds, lace bugs, shoot flies, and whiteflies have been recorded in Paraná State, Brazil, but the distinct species and their distribution are yet to be determined. This lack of information limits the development of strategies to mitigate pest damage. Surveys were conducted in 39 counties (four farms per county) distributed throughout the state that encompass the various socioeconomic regions. The collected material was properly packed and sent to the laboratory for identification, and the following species were identified: lace bugs Vatiga illudens Drake, 1922 and Vatiga manihotae Drake, 1922 (both Hemiptera: Tingidae); whiteflies Bemisia tuberculata (Bondar, 1923) and Aleurothrixus aepim (Goeldi, 1886) (both Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and the cassava shoot fly Neosilba perezi Romero & Ruppel, 1973 (Diptera: Lonchaeidae) in Paraná State. Lace bugs were not found in the samples in the eastern and southern portions of the state. V. illudens was more widespread than V. manihotae. The whitefly A. aepim was not observed in three counties (eastern, southern, and central regions), whereas B. tuberculata and the cassava shoot fly were found in all regions sampled in Paraná State. Suggestions for future investigations of pest management are proposed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43802/30570,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Protein-energy supplementation on productive and nutritional performance of grazing beef heifers,"This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of protein-energy supplementation on productive performance, intake, digestibility, and microbial protein synthesis in heifers fed tropical forage. Twelve Nellore heifers at 11 months of age, with a mean initial body weight of 248.8 ± 11.40 kg were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with two treatments and six replicates. The treatments evaluated were: control (without supplementation); and supplementation in the amount of 1.5 kg animal-1 day-1. Forage samples were collected to evaluate the chemical composition and the total availability of dry matter of the pasture consumed by the animals. To evaluate the intake and forage digestibility, a trial was performed using internal and external markers. In this study no effect of supplementation was observed on the intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), forage DM, or neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (NDFap; P > 0.10). However, supplementation increased (P < 0.01) the intakes of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC). Additionally, an upward trend (P=0.076) was observed in the intake of digested OM (DOM) with supplementation. On the other hand, supplementation increased (P < 0.01) the digestibility coefficients of OM, CP, EE, and NFC, although supplementation did not affect the ruminal synthesis of nitrogen compounds (MICN), efficiency of protein microbial synthesis (EMS), relative microbial nitrogen (RMICN) or urine urea nitrogen (UUN) excretion (P > 0.57). Lastly, supplementation increased (P=0.050) the average daily gain of the animals, although no effect (P > 0.10) was observed on their final body weight. These results suggested that protein-energy supplementation improves the productive performance and nutritional characteristics of grazing beef heifers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43893/30569,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Irrigated sugarcane crops improve the quality of soil organic carbon over time,"The substitution of native vegetation in agricultural systems can cause several changes in the chemical and physical soil attributes, and in the dynamics of soil organic carbon. This study aimed to evaluate changes in soil physical attributes and carbon stock in soil organic matter fractions in irrigated sugarcane crops, as a function of land use and straw management practices over time, in the North of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Four sugarcane fields with different ages and management systems were studied: Cane 6, Cane 7, Cane 8, and Cane 10. The data obtained were compared with a native vegetation area located near the sugarcane fields, and used as reference for unmanaged soil. In each system, soil samples were collected in the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth layers, to determine the physical attributes, the total organic carbon, and the physical fractions of the soil organic matter. We found that the sugarcane management with the maintenance of a part of the straw on the soil surface contributes to the preservation of the soil structure and the most stable fractions of organic carbon over time. However, in the regions with high annual mean temperature and in the irrigated systems, the soil tillage for the renewal of the sugarcane fields significantly decreases the total soil organic carbon.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43938/30558,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Chemical and microbiological changes in the soil mediated by different vegetative coverings in a Natal orange orchard,"Proper soil cover management for citrus cultivation can contribute to increased productivity and improved soil quality. This study examined five different vegetative coverings [Urochloa brizantha; U. decumbens, U. ruziziensis, spontaneous vegetation, and herbicide application (glyphosate) in the total area] in the inter rows of a Natal orange orchard [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] grafted on the Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi × Poncirus trifoliata). Their effects on the microbiological and chemical attributes of the soil and the vegetative development in the orchard were examined. Chemical (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, P, pH, H+Al, CECpH7, base saturation, and OM) and microbiological (carbon and nitrogen of microbial biomass, basal respiration, and metabolic quotient) soil attributes in the rows and inter-rows were evaluated for the orchard in 2018 and 2019. There was a significant difference for most variables in the 2 years studied, emphasizing 2019 for microbiological parameters and OM, with the latter being 14.8% lower in the treatment with glyphosate in the total area compared to the treatment with spontaneous vegetation. The results showed the benefits of vegetation cover with brachiaria in inter-rows of the Natal sweet orange orchard in the chemical and microbiological attributes of the soil, especially in carbon and nitrogen of the microbial biomass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44132/30571,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Production and nutritional value of wheat and triticale cultivars in different harvest times in the Minas Gerais semiarid,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the productive performance and nutritional value of forage of wheat and triticale cultivars at different harvest times in the semiarid region of Minas Gerais. Eight wheat cultivars and two triticale cultivars harvested at three stages of plant development were evaluated: Rubberization, grain at the stage of soft mass and harvest maturation. The experimental design adopted was a randomized block in a factorial scheme 10 × 3, with three replicates, 10 cultivars and 3 developmental stages for plant collection. The main agronomic characteristics and nutritional value were evaluated of forage of the cultivars under study. The study demonstrated the potential of wheat and triticale cultivation for forage in the semiarid region of Minas Gerais. The mean dry matter yield of wheat cultivars was 5.90 t ha -1, 7.85 t ha -1 and 7.98 t ha -1 and triticale 6.47 t ha -1, 9.97 t ha -1 and 10.5 t ha -1 for the rubber harvesting stages, grain at the stage of soft mass and harvest maturation, respectively. For the average crude protein content, the wheat cultivars showed 15.07%, 9.13%, 10.60% and the triticale cultivars showed 14.4%, 9.31% and 10.05% for the harvest stages of rubber formation, grain at the stage of soft mass and harvest maturation, respectively. When evaluating the average levels of total digestible nutrients, the wheat and triticale cultivars showed an average of 48.90% and 48.67% in the rubber harvesting stage and 42.68% and 49.60% in the grain in the mass stage suave and 44.43% and 42.90% at harvest maturation. The highest yield of digestible dry matter was observed with the cultivars harvested at the grain stage at the soft mass stage. Triticale IPR 111 and Wheat IPR PANATY had greater productive potential and better nutritional quality for use as forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44281/30581,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Ovine Eimeria infections in southern Brazil – prevalence and risk factors,": Eimeria infections are common in sheep industry worldwide, however information about their epidemiology is scarce in southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence, species characterization, and associated risk factors between Eimeria species and sheep flocks. Fecal samples from 428 sheep from 21 farms were tested for the presence of oocysts. The overall prevalence of Eimeria spp. was 68.69% and was significantly affected by age of the sheep, with highest prevalence in animals under 18 months of age. Eight Eimeria species were identified. Eimeria ovinoidalis (85.71%) was the most common, followed by Eimeria crandallis (80.95%), Eimeria granulosa (78.95%), Eimeria ahsata (61.90%), Eimeria faurei (42.86%), Eimeria bakuensis (38.10%), Eimeria punctata (14.29%), and Eimeria pallida (9.52%). All herds were positive, with concomitant infections. Among management and husbandry practices; farm size, animal density, farming system, breeding objectives, and pasture system influenced the prevalence of Eimeria species. The infection was more prevalent on small farms with high animal density, in sheep raised for meat, semi-intensive system, and rotational grazing (p < 0.05). The wide distribution of this protozoan and the high frequency of pathogenic species show the importance and potential damage of coccidiosis in sheep flocks in Rio Grande do Sul.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44153/30552,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Spatio-temporal dynamics of milk production in Brazil,"The milk production chain has relevance for the Brazilian economy, generating jobs and income. In addition, milk production, because of family-based farms, has an important social function. However, milk production is spatially heterogeneous in Brazil, especially due to the different technological patterns of production. In this context, the objective of this study was to verify the spatio-temporal distribution and dynamics of milk production in Brazil. For this purpose, milk production in Brazil in 2000 and 2016 was analyzed. The Brazilian microregions that specialize in milk production were identified using location quotient (LQ). An exploratory analysis of spatial data and Moran’s I were used to measure spatial autocorrelation among regions. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the grouping relationships of variables as a function of the regions that specialize in milk production. Between 2000 and 2016, there was a decrease in the number of microregions that specialize in milk production. Thus, in 2016, approximately 20% of the microregions and over 22% of Brazilian municipalities specialized in milk production. The microregions and municipalities that specialize in milk production were concentrated mainly in the states of Minas Gerais and Goiás and in the Southern region of Brazil. There was an increase in milk productivity in all regions of the country, especially in those regions where production was concentrated. The formation of high-high clusters was found in the most productive regions of the country, i.e., in the South and Southeast, where the effects of technological spillover were observed, and the formation of low-low clusters was observed in the less productive regions, i.e., in the North and Northeast. Two main components were formed. The first component aggregated variables related to milk production in volume, and the second component aggregated variables inherent to productivity. It was possible to verify the recent growth in milk production and productivity in the country as well as to demonstrate the heterogeneity in production. Although there was a decrease in the number of microregions and municipalities that specialize in milk production, there was a concentration and increase in milk production and productivity in Brazil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44007/30559,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Contribution of tiller age category to herbage accumulation of Marandu palisadegrass under two fertilization regimes,"Based on the hypothesis that climate and fertilizers influence the proportion of tiller age categories in the canopy and, consequently, in herbage accumulation, the objective of this study was to determine the population density and the contribution of tiller age categories for herbage accumulation of Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu during the year and in response to phosphate and nitrogen fertilization. The treatments consisted of two fertilization strategies: low and high fertilization and three tiller ages (young, mature and old), evaluated at four times of the year: winter, early and late spring, and summer. The total number of tillers and the proportion of young tillers were higher in late spring and summer. The growth and herbage accumulation rates showed a typical seasonal pattern and were higher in the canopy under high fertilization. Old tillers contributed more to control the total stem growth rate, as well as the canopy senescence rate. The highest percentage of young tillers is related to the high herbage accumulation in the Marandu palisadegrass canopy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44022/30551,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Elephant grass cv. BRS capiaçu silage with inclusion of different proportions of silk cotton,"The objective was to evaluate the qualitative and nutritional aspects of elephant grass cv. BRS capiaçu silage with increasing proportions of silk cotton. A completely randomized design was used with five (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60% on natural matter basis) different inclusion proportions of silk cotton to elephant grass silage and four repetitions. Silages were prepared in PVC minisilos and remained ensiled for 42 days. The inclusion of silk cotton resulted in a linear reduction in dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), cellulose, and indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) contents at 0.06, 0.30, 0.23, 0.20, and 0.09 percentage points for each 1% inclusion, respectively. There was an increasing linear effect of crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN), with an increase of 39.32 and 20.89% from the lowest to the highest inclusion of silk cotton to elephant grass cv. BRS capiaçu silage. Values of pH, gas losses (GL), effluent losses (EL), dry matter recovery (DMR), hemicellulose, and lignin were not influenced by the evaluated inclusion levels, showing estimated averages of 3.87, 1, 42%, 11.55kg t-1 natural matter, 97.36%, 19.30%, and 7.20%, respectively. An increasing linear effect was found for fraction a, c, effective degradability (ED) (2% and 5%) dry matter, with an increment of 0.05, 0.0005, and 0.11 percent points, respectively. There was a quadratic effect for fraction b, potential degradability (PD), ED (2%), with minimum points of 23.72%, 50.52%, (at 45% inclusion level) 39.69%, (at 15% inclusion level) respectively. The indigestible fraction (IF) had a quadratic effect with a maximum of 49.48% at the 45% inclusion level. The colonization time (CT) linearly reduced by 0.09 percentage points for each 1% inclusion evaluated. According to the parameters evaluated, the inclusion of up to 60% silk cotton improved nutritional aspects and nutritional value of elephant grass cv. BRS capiaçu silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43959/30549,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Classification of dairy properties according to the geometric mean of the somatic cell count and its antimicrobial resistance profile,"Milk and its derivatives are highly consumed foods worldwide, with recognized nutritional importance. The search for the production of products with superior quality is constant. For the present work, 26 milk-producing properties were selected, with a total of 506 milk samples collected during the period from October 2019 to May 2020 being evaluated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of milk produced in dairy properties in the region west Paraná, classified as good or bad based on the results of the Somatic Cell Count (SCC) and through sampling (n = 10) to evaluate the resistance profile of enterobacteria and Staphylococcus spp. isolated from milk samples, in addition to the presence of the mecA gene in strains of Staphylococcus spp. resistant to oxacillin. There were significant differences between the good and bad properties for the levels of lactose, SCC (cell/mL), and Standard Plate Count (SPC) (CFU/mL). The strains of Staphylococcus spp. showed differences in the percentage of resistance in relation to the good and bad properties for antibiotics: tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, oxacillin, amikacin, clindamycin, gentamycin, and erythromycin. The mecA gene was not detected in any of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates that showed resistance to oxacillin. For enterobacteria, the isolated species differed in relation to the classification of properties, with predominance for Escherichia coli (40%) for properties classified as bad and Hafnia alvei (40%) for those classified as good. The percentage of antibiotic resistance compared to enterobacteria isolates was higher in properties classified as good. Monitoring through microbial culture and antibiogram is extremely important, favoring the correct choice for the treatment of animals with a reduced selection of resistant strains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43943/30547,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Body mass index at calving on performance and efficiency of Zebu cow herds,"This study examines the impact of the body mass index (BMI) at calving on the development and postpartum efficiency of cows of Zebu origin. The study involved 87 cows and their calves [pure Nellore (N) or predominant Nellore composition in a cross with Charolais (C) (3/4N1/4C and 5/8N3/8C)]. The mothers were grouped into classes according to their BMI at calving, namely, ‘small’, ‘moderate’ and ‘large’. Body mass index was determined by dividing the body weight of the cows by their length and by hip height and then dividing the result by 10. Cows were weighed at calving, at weaning, at the end of the breeding period and at the diagnosis of pregnancy. Calves were weighed at birth, at early weaning (63 days) and at 210 of age. To evaluate milk yield and quality, milk was collected at 21, 42 and 63 days after calving. Milk yield was measured by the direct method, with manual milking, followed by analysis of the lactose, fat, total solids and crude protein contents. Pregnancy rate was similar between the three BMI groups; however, cows with a lower BMI were more efficient at calving in producing kilograms of calf per kilogram of cow kept. Higher BMI provide higher milk yields, without affecting its quality, as well as heavier calves at early weaning and at 210 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43960/30550,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Effect of amino acid supplementation and choline chloride for low protein diet on nitrogen efficiency and methane emission of dairy cows,"Ruminants are one of the largest anthropogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Therefore, the hypothesis was to study the effects of reducing dietary crude protein (CP) level on environmental contaminators when rumen-protected amino acids and choline chloride were supplemented. Sixty Holstein dairy cows were used during the experiment. Test diets were: (1) CD = Control diet with16.2 g of crude protein/ Kg of DM); (2) LM = Low protein diet with 14.2 g of crude protein/ Kg of DM + methionine ; (3) LL = Low protein diet with 14.2 g of crude protein/ Kg of DM + lysine; (4) LML = Low protein diet with 14.2 g of crude protein/ Kg of DM + methionine + lysine; (5) LMLC = Low protein diet with 14.2 g of crude protein/ Kg of DM + methionine + lysine + choline. Dry matter and NDF intake were not different, but the control group received higher CP and ADF compared with other groups (P < 0.05). Fecal CP and ADF of control group were lower (P < 0.05), but no differences were observed for fecal dry matter (DM) and NDF. Milk yield and protein content were higher for LML and LMLC like control group (P < 0.05). Nitrogen intake, urinary N, urinary urea N and total excreta N decreased (P < 0.05) when animals fed low protein. There was no difference in ruminal pH and acetate to propionate ratio, whereas the ruminal ammonia-N decreased with the low protein (P < 0.05). The 120-h gas production test, showed no difference on the kinetics of digestion and in vitro methane emission. However, the inclusion of DMI in the calculations revealed that low protein can reduce (P < 0.05) methane emission. Overall, our findings indicated that low protein can be compensated for by adding rumen-protected amino acids, not only to maintain the animal performance, but also to decrease nitrogen excretion and methane emission.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43958/30548,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Socioeconomic profile of producers and dairy technological of farms in the southern mesoregion of Santa Catarina,"This study characterized the socioeconomic profile of milk producers and dairy technological of farms in the southern mesoregion of Santa Catarina. Following a 6.5% sampling of total farms by municipality, 95% confidence level, 5% sampling error, and group heterogeneity, data were collected from 308 farms, 22 of which were excluded due to insufficient data. The farmers were selected randomly, and information extracted from an electronic form, addressing social, economic, technical and technological issues. The data were analyzed using factor, cluster, and discriminant analysis. As farms with the main activity of dairy farming, they have an average area of 20.79 hectares and a production of 12.18 liters per animal per day. I n the factor analysis, the first factor was related to the area and productivity of farms and the second factor to sanitary control and the feed variety of the animals. The cluster analysis formed three clusters; the first and the second were composed of larger farms and areas, and the other consisted of smaller farms, the latter involving more producers. As farms are characterized by low production, there is clearly a deficiency in technical support for producers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43366/30545,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Effect of mineral-energy supplementation on the performance of young bulls from different genetic groups on pasture,": The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of young bulls from three genetic groups, ½ Brangus x ½ Nellore (BRN), Nellore (NEL) and ½ Canchim x ½ Nellore (CAN), reared on pasture and supplemented with mineral (MS) or energy-mineral (MES) supplement. Eighty-one bulls, with a mean age of 12 months and mean body weight of 252 ± 33 kg were used. The experiment was conducted in a 3x2 factorial completely randomized design. Each genetic group was subdivided into six experimental plots, three received MS and three received MES. Animals were managed in a rotational stocking system in a Tifton 85 grass pasture. The consumption of MS was similar between the genetic groups with an average of 0.073 kg animal-1 day-1, whereas the consumption of MES was higher for BRN, 2.10 kg animal-1 day-1, followed by CAN, with 1.57 kg animal-1 day-1, and lower for NEL, with 1.28 kg animal-1 day-1. The average daily weight gain (ADG) was greater for animals that received MES compared to those that were given MS. For animals that received MS, the BRN group had ADG of 0.64 kg animal-1, while the NEL and CAN groups were similar with a mean of 0.46 kg animal-1. For animals that received MES, the CAN group had higher ADG, 0.97 kg animal-1, while the NEL and BRN groups were similar, with an average of 0.86 kg animal-1. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, creatinine, glucose and cholesterol did not change depending on the types of supplements used or between genetic groups. Higher serum urea levels were observed in NEL and CAN animals that received MS. Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher in BRN and CAN animals that received MES. Gains in rump height, height at the withers, body length, rump width and chest perimeter were greater in animals that received MES. Mostly, the gains in morphometric measurements were greater for crossbred animals than for the NEL group. The supply of mineral-energy supplement in Tifton 85 grass pasture during the rainy season is recommended only for Nellore and ½ Canchim x ½ Nellore young bulls. Crossbred young bulls show greater gains in morphometric measurements than Nellore young bulls during rearing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42176/30543,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Effect of replacement of forage sorghum silage with biomass sorghum silage in diets for dairy heifers,"This trial aimed to analyze the replacement of forage sorghum silage (FS silage) with biomass sorghum silage (BRS 716 silage) in diets for heifers ¾ Holstein x ¼ Zebu on their nutrient intake and digestibility, nitrogen balance, microbial production, feeding behavior, and animal performance. Eight heifers with average age 18±4 months (mo) and average body weight (BW) 271 ± 57 kg were used. The experimental design was double-Latin square, 4×4, being four diets, four experimental periods and four animals. Four experimental diets with 0, 33, 67 and 100% substitution of forage sorghum silage with biomass sorghum silage were used. The roughage:concentrate ratio in the total dry matter (DM) of the diets was 75:25. The fraction “b” of DM was higher in the BRS 716 silage. There was no difference (p> 0.05) for dry matter intake (DMI; p = 0.45) and total digestible nutrients intake (p = 0.76). The dry matter digestibility (DMD), crude protein, ether extract and neutral detergent fiber increased linearly with the inclusion of BRS 716 silage. The feeding times, ruminating and idle have not been changed (p > 0.05). The replacement of FS silage with BRS 716 silage did not modify the average daily weight gain (ADG; p > 0.05; mean 1.30 ± 0.025 kg). Biomass sorghum silage can replace up to 100% forage sorghum silage in the diets of ¾ Holstein x ¼ Zebu heifers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43801/30546,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Use of biostimulants in elephant grass cv. Napier,"This study was developed to examine the growth, yield, chemical composition and in situ degradability of elephant grass cv. Napier (Pennisetum purpureum). Five spraying protocols with biostimulants were tested, namely, Control - no application; 1BR - bioregulator at seven days; 2BR - bioregulator at seven days + bioregulator and foliar fertilization at 20 days; 2BR2 - bioregulator at seven days + bioregulator and foliar fertilization at 20 days + ethylene inhibitor at 30 days; and 3BR - bioregulator at seven days + bioregulator and foliar fertilization at 20 days + ethylene inhibitor and bioregulator at 30 days. The grass was cut evenly at a height of 15 cm and harvested at 70 days of regrowth. The experimental area was divided into two blocks according to the slope. Ninety plots were used, totaling an area of 4,608 m2. Each plot was composed of four 4-m rows spaced 80 cm apart. Chemical composition, morphological traits and forage digestibility data were evaluated. The 3BR protocol, with more bioregulator-based applications, resulted in higher canopy (9.78%) and stem (9.58%) compared with control group. The 2BR and 2BR2 treatments provided a 6.5% higher stem than control treatment. The improvement in the nutritional value of Pennisetum purpureum cv. Napier was due to the 17.55% increase in crude protein (CP) content provided by protocol 3BR relative to control group. Treatments 2BR2 and 3BR improved the effective degradability of dry matter (DM). The application of biostimulant protocols increased the potential degradability of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (+4.1%), with the greatest response seen in treatment 2BR2 in comparison with control treatment. Biostimulant protocols increase the canopy and stem heights and CP content. The application of a bioregulator associated with foliar fertilization and ethylene inhibitor improves the effective degradability of DM and NDF and the potential degradability of NDF in Pennisetum purpureum cv. Napier harvested at 70 days of regrowth.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43135/30580,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The objective of this study was to determine the budding, flowering, and fruit set rates of peach trees cultivated in the municipality of Dois Vizinhos, Southwestern Paraná, Brazil. The present work was developed using the collection of peach trees in the fruit growing sector of the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. Sixteen peach cultivars were evaluated: Rubimel, Leonense, Coral, Marli, Charme, Riograndense, Douradão, Chimarrita, Granada, BR-1, Bonão, and Eldorado (all planted in 2009), as well as Regalo, Kampai, Fascínio, and Zilli (planted in 2014). The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications of one plant each, in a 16 × 2 bifactorial arrangement (cultivars × year/harvest). Phenology evaluations were performed weekly by counting open (anthesis) and sprouted flower buds, and the fruit set rate was measured just before fruit thinning. Flowering (%), budding (%), and fruit set (%) rates were calculated. It was found that the year/harvest 2016 promoted the highest rates of sprouting and fruit set. The Bonão cultivar showed greater flowering intensity and regularity in the crop years evaluated (2016 and 2017).

43,2022,Linear and spatial variability of eucalyptus dendrometric attributes correlated with the properties of a Typic Haplustox soil (Oxisol) in the Brazilian savannah,"Effects of soil attributes using the geostatistical tool improves the interpretation of specific soil management. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties of a Typical Haplustox (Oxisol), identifying those with the best linear and spatial correlation with eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) vegetative growth. The experiment was conducted at the Teaching, Research, and Extension Farm (FEPE) of the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Campus of Ilha Solteira. Thirty-five points spaced 13 meters apart were demarcated for analysis, which were distributed in 5 rows of 7 points each. From each point, 2 soil samples were collected from the 0-10 cm depth layer. The physical, chemical, and microbiological soil properties evaluated were: sand, silt, and clay contents; penetration resistance (PR), gravimetric moisture (GM), real density (RD), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), respirometry (CO2-C), metabolic quotient (qCO2), organic matter content (OM), and hydrogenionic potential (pH). The eucalyptus attributes assessed were: plant height (PH) and circumference at breast height (CBH). Each attribute was analyzed by descriptive statistics using the SAS software. Data frequency distribution was verified by the Shapiro Wilk method, and geospatial changes were analyzed by the GS+ software. The soil property that best explained the variability in eucalyptus dendrometric attributes was real density (RD). Except for RD, all properties did not show spatial dependence (i.e., pure nugget effect), which significantly represents eucalyptus vegetative performance.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43495/30538,E-ISSN 1679-0359
43,2022,Experimental infection of BALB/c mice with felid alphaherpesvirus 1,"Felid alphaherpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) is an important cause of respiratory and ocular diseases in cats worldwide. Mice have been widely used to study the pathogenesis of several human and animal viruses, especially herpesviruses. This study aimed to verify whether BALB/c mice are susceptible to FHV-1 infection. The animals were intranasally inoculated with FHV-1 and their clinical signs were observed from 3 days post-infection (dpi). At 10 dpi, the animals were euthanized and the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys were collected for histopathological examination and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that mice were infected with FHV-1 and reproduced several features of the disease observed in its natural host. Histological lesions and viral DNA were found in all sampled tissues, with a higher frequency of FHV-1 DNA copies detected in the lungs. All mice were seroconverted to FHV-1 at 7 dpi. To our knowledge, this is the first report of experimental infection of BALB/c mice with FHV-1. Our findings demonstrate that this murine model can contribute to our understanding of FHV-1 pathogenesis and may be useful for trials against this virus.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43252/30541,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Optimization of dietary lemon seed essential oil to enhance alfalfa silage chemical composition and in vitro degradability,"Purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of lemon-seed essential oils on chemical composition and in vitro degradability of alfalfa silage. Treatments were alfalfa silage with no additive (control) or treated with 60 ml/kg DM of lemon-seed (C60), of lemon-seed (C120) essential oils and equal mixed of them (M60). Whole plant alfalfa silage was ensiled for 60 d in triplicate laboratory scale tubes. Dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, insoluble fiber in acidic and neutral detergent, water soluble carbohydrate, pH, were measured with 3 replicates by in vitro gas production method. Dry matter (DM) content was greater for leo60 than control.  Compared with control, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration was decreased in leo120. Addition of essential oils and their combination to the silage significantly decreased (p<.0001) silage pH compared with untreated silage interestingly increased for all the silages containing essential oil compared with untreated silage. Addition of lemon-seed essential to alfalfa silage decreased the rate of disappearance of organic matter and dry matter in all treatments compared to the control treatment. The degradability potential of alfalfa silage has increased in treatments containing lemon-seed essential oil (60 ml / kg DM) which is significantly different from the control. In general, the obtained data show the positive effect of lemon-seed essential oil on the quality of alfalfa silage and its fermentation properties.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42031/29064,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Production and quality of corn silage with forage and pigeon peas in a crop-livestock system,"The objective of this study was to evaluate maize in consortium with forage in a crop-livestock system for silage production, with subsequent formation of pasture. The experimental design comprised randomized blocks, with four replications, two types of corn cultivation, intercropped with two Brachiaria species (marandu grass and convert grass), and with and without intercropping with the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) BRS Mandarin. Dry matter productivity, the morphological composition of the corn, the botanical composition of the Brachiaria and pigeon peas, and the bromatological composition of the silage and Brachiaria were evaluated, as well as the losses caused by effluents. The consortia did not interfere with the productivity of corn for silage, and the silage from the consortium with pigeon peas exhibited a higher concentration of crude protein, demonstrating that the modality of the integrated agricultural production system of corn culture with Brachiaria and pigeon peas is an alternative to increase the protein content of the ensiled material and provide greater diversity of the remaining forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40964/29045,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Economic feasibility of implementing an infrastructure for collecting rainwater from the roof of free-stall sheds,"This study aimed to analyze the economic feasibility of implementing and using the necessary infrastructure to collect rainwater from the roof of free-stall sheds in a dairy production system in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Specifically, the total cost (TC), total operating cost (TOC), and actual operating cost (AOC) of a cubic meter of rainwater and the break-even point in cubic meters were estimated. The research was conducted from January to December 2017 on a property located in the south of Minas Gerais. The following MOP scenarios were analyzed: most likely (Scenario 1), optimistic (scenario 2), and pessimistic (scenario 3). The grant value of the Das Velhas River basin was considered for the most likely scenario, as it has the most similar value with that of the basin surrounding the Furnas reservoir, in which the property is inserted. The grant value for water collection and consumption from the Paraíba River basin was considered in Scenario 2, as this Federal basin has the lowest grant value. The grant value for water collection and consumption from the Piracicaba, Jundiaí, and Capivari river basins was considered in Scenario 3, as these basins have the highest prices for the cubic meter of the collected and consumed water. The implementation of the infrastructure for collecting rainwater from the roof of free-stall sheds under the studied conditions was economically unfeasible for all scenarios, with negative net present values (NPV). Simple and discounted paybacks were longer than the proposed horizon. The internal rate of return (IRR) could not be estimated due to the negative values of the net cash flow. The benefit-cost ratios (BCR) were unsatisfactory (lower than 1). The TC values for rainwater collection from the roof of free-stall sheds were R$ 23,206.59 and R$ 20,489.25 for scenarios with interest rates of 8.50 and 6.99%, respectively, while the TOC value was R$ 7,850.30 for all analyzed scenarios. The unit values for TOC and AOC were R$ 9.9024/m3 and R$ 1.3060/m3 of collected water, respectively. The break-even point could not be estimated in the studied scenarios, as the variable cost per cubic meter of water collected from the roof of the free-stall shed was higher than the grant value charged by the water management committees of the different studied basins.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41068/29046,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Yield and nutritive value of mechanically processed corn silage from an integrated crop-livestock system,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the yield and nutritional value of silage made from corn intercropped with marandu palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) in an integrated crop-livestock system. The corn was harvested at different maturity stages and cutting heights and was processed or not before ensiling. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications in a 2x2x2+1 factorial scheme. The treatments were composed of silage corn intercropped with marandu palisadegrass harvested at two cutting heights (20 or 45 cm) and two stages of maturity (1/4 of the kernel milk line or kernel physiological maturity) and subjected to two methods of processing (crushing or not crushing). A control treatment composed of conventionally grown corn silage was also included. The total dry matter yields of both crops did not differ significantly among treatments, demonstrating the viability of the intercropping system for both forage species. Although the dry matter content of the corn plants was higher at the time of ensiling, the fermentative and nutritive quality of the silages was not affected. Increasing the cutting height increased the grain content of the forage mass and also avoided harming the development of the intercropped grass. The silages from the physiological maturity treatment and from the processed treatment had the best quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40794/29044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Body condition score at lambing and performance of Santa Inês ewes with an offspring during lactation,"The main objective of this research work was to evaluate the performance of Santa Inês ewes according to their body condition score (BCS) at lambing. Data from 135 adult ewes, with singletons, were used. Ewes were divided into three distinct groups: 1) Bellow average: BCS less than 2.5 points (n = 44); 2) Average: BCS between 2.5 and 3.0 (n = 53); and 3) Above average: BCS greater than 3.0 (n = 38). The scale for BCS varied from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very fat). The individual BW, BCS, metabolic profile, milk production and composition of ewes as well as their lambs’ performance until weaning were considered. Metabolic profile was monitored at -7, +7 and +60 days relative to lambing. It was observed that ewes with higher BCS were also heavier; however, there were no differences among the groups for weights of lambs at birth and weaning (70 days). As there was no difference in milk production and composition, the average daily weight gain of the lambs was also similar for the different BCS groups. The metabolic profile (glucose, ?-hydroxibutyrate, cholesterol, creatinine, urea, hemoglobin, albumin, total protein and aspartate aminotransferase - AST) was also similar among the groups. However, when the metabolic profile was compared among the different physiological stages relative to lambing, some differences were observed. For example, ?-hydroxibutyrate was greater during the peripartum period, and glucose was greater in the lactation phase. As conclusion we could say that even in a situation of poor BCS, Santa Inês ewes have the physiological capacity to adapt themselves to the negative energy balance like those of the periparturient period. It seems that irrespective of the BCS, ewes prioritized lactation and were able to produce enough milk to accordingly nurse their lambs",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40308/29041,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Use of babassu cake and pineapple byproduct silage in the diets of feedlot sheep,"This study evaluated the use of babassu cake as a replacement for soybean meal and pineapple byproduct silage as roughage in the diets of feedlot sheep. Ten rumen-fistulated sheep were used and distributed in an experimental design consisting of two 5 x 5 Latin squares. Babassu cake replaced soybean meal at four concentration levels (0, 26.66, 53.33, and 80%), and pineapple byproduct silage was used as roughage. A treatment was also evaluated in which elephant grass silage was used as roughage and corn and soybean meal were used as the concentrate. No effect of babassu cake as a replacement for soybean meal on dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber, or crude protein was observed. Higher babassu cake replacement levels in the diets resulted in linear reductions in the digestibility of the dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, organic matter, nonfiber carbohydrates and total carbohydrates. For the digestibility of the crude protein, no effect was observed after the addition of babassu cake. The replacement levels of the babassu cake had no effect on the intake and retention of the daily nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and ruminal pH. Babassu cake could replace soybean meal at concentrations of up to 80% when the roughage source was pineapple byproduct silage. Compared with elephant grass silage, pineapple byproduct silage improves nutrient intake and digestibility and nitrogen intake, retention, and absorption without compromising the ruminal pH or ammonia nitrogen of feedlot sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40250/29040,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Economic-financial analysis of the use of biscuit bran as an energy alternative in diets for confined lambs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic and financial viability of replacing corn with biscuit bran (BB) in diets for Morada Nova lambs in feedlot. Twenty lambs confined with initial body weight of 17.00 ± 3.74 kg were used, arranged in four treatments, diet without biscuit bran (BB) and diets containing 15, 30 or 45% of biscuit bran in place of corn in the diet. Data, expenses and revenues of the activity were obtained during the period of January 2020 in the municipality of Sobral, Ceará. The economic and financial evaluation was carried out descriptively, using Excel® spreadsheets. In the scenarios evaluated, feeding, animal acquisition and labor costs were the items that most contributed to production costs. The highest food costs were observed in the system that used 15% of BB, representing about 32.86% of the total costs. The simulation for sheep production provided revenue higher than the production costs in all diets tested, resulting in positive economic indicators. On the other hand, although the system that uses diet without biscuit bran provides positive revenue, net income was the lowest (R$ 12,117.15 year-1). It was observed that all scenarios had a leveling point higher than 5,000 kg of meat year-1. The total productivity of the factors of all treatments evaluated was higher than 1, which indicates that the activity is stable, presenting high internal rates of return. Similarly, profitability rates are attractive, especially for diets containing BB, where the net present value is higher (R$ 362,143.26). Sensitivity analyses showed that even in the most unfavorable situations, such as a 30% reduction in production and market price, indicators are economically viable. The use of BB does not compromise the economic viability of the diet compared to the diet without BB, they present higher profitability, especially at the level of 15% in the diet.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40157/29370,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Are the effects of dietary lipid content in grazing beef cattle independent of the amount of concentrate supplement?,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of levels of concentrate supplement and dietary lipids on the nutritional characteristics, metabolic parameters, and performance of Nellore bulls grazing tropical pasture. Twenty-seven Nellore bulls were allotted to 2 × 2 completely randomized factorial design with two levels of supplementation and two levels of dietary lipids. The concentrate supplement was fed at 4 g kg-1 BW (low supplementation) and 8 g kg-1 BW (high supplementation), whereas the dietary lipid content was 28 g of ether extract (EE) g-1 on a dry matter basis (DM) (low-lipid diet) and 42 g EE kg-1 DM (high-lipid diet). There was no interaction between the level of concentrate supplement and dietary lipid content on all studied variables. High levels of supplementation led to shorter grazing time and reduced forage dry matter intake (DMF). On the other hand, the DM intake increased with increasing levels of concentrate supplement, with no significant effects on DM digestibility. The dietary lipid content did not affect forage and DM intakes. However, the digestibility of DM and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were lowest in high-lipid diets. Bulls receiving high levels of supplementation had higher average daily gains than low-supplemented animals. Neither the amount of concentrate supplement nor the dietary lipid content affected the hot carcass yield and carcass weight. Carcass fat deposition was greater in bulls fed high-lipid diets than in animals receiving low-lipid diets. The effects of the level of concentrate supplement and dietary lipid content on the nutritional characteristics and performance of grazing beef cattle are independent. Concentrate supplementation at 8 g kg-1 BW increases cattle performance but decreases forage utilization. Diets containing 42 g EE kg-1 DM reduces the digestibility of dry matter and fiber fractions, but increases backfat thickness.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40632/29042,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Yield, milk quality and physiological variables of dairy cows in rainy and dry seasons","The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of the dry and rainy seasons on the production, milk quality (lactose, fat, protein, total solids, TBC and SCC) and physiological (rectal and surface temperature and respiratory and heart rate) of crossbred cows (holstein/ zebu) in lactation, under rotational grazing regime in cultivated pasture, using 10 crossbred cows (holstein / zebu) in lactation, average live weight of 500 ± 30 kg, and in the rainy season they were between the fourth and fifth months of lactation and in the dry period were between the seventh and eighth months of lactation with an average initial production of 18 ± 4kg of milk / cow / day, maintaining batch homogeneity in both seasons. The animals were kept in a semi-intensive rearing system, using rotational grazing on pasture of Brachiaria decumbens, in an area of 3 hectares, where there was a conglomerate of trees that provided 5m² / animal with natural shade, to shelter the animals in the warm shorelines The seasons and times of the day significantly influenced (P < 0.05) the ambient temperature, relative air humidity and the black globe temperature index and humidity. The respiratory rate and surface temperature were higher (P < 0.05) in the dry season and the values for rectal temperature and respiratory rate were similar (P > 0.05) in the seasons. Milk production and protein showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) depending on the seasons. With the aid of physiological variables (rectal and surface temperature and heart and respiratory rate), even so, cows decreased their production and increased the concentration of protein in milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39583/29061,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Genetic diversity of Matrinxã breeding stocks: implications for management and conservation,"The formation of fish breeding stocks for fish farming or conservation programs is commonly carried out from the capture of fish in natural environments. Information on the geographic and genetic origin of these stocks is important to guide actions that allow correct management in captivity and, when lost, harm production and genetic conservation. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and origin of two breeding stocks of matrinxã, Brycon amazonicus (INPA, Amazonas - INPA and Nova Motum, Mato Grosso - NM). A total of 68 caudal fin samples were collected, including 33 INPA samples and 35 NM samples. Twenty pairs of microsatellite primers were tested, but only seven primers showed satisfactory amplification, amplifying 41 alleles ranging from 187-318 bp. The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.135 (Borg25) to 0.782 (Bh6). Exclusive alleles were observed for both populations (INPA: 04 and NM: 18). Allelic richness results revealed that there was increased loss of genetic variation in NM, indicating a lower evolutionary potential of this stock. The average values of the observed heterozygosity corroborated this statement; however, there were high values for INPA (0.545) and NM (0.475), signifying an adequate genetic variability. An imbalance was found in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the Borg59 locus in INPA (P < 0.05), possibly due to the effect of null alleles, but was attributed to a founder effect. For NM, an imbalance in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed at loci BoM13 and Bh6, which together with the results of the mean inbreeding coefficient values demonstrated the presence of genetic drift. The analysis of molecular variance showed greater variation within populations than between them, and was confirmed by the genetic differentiation value (0.086 - moderate genetic differentiation) and by the distance and genetic identity values (0.273 and 0.761, respectively). Bayesian analysis designated a value of K = 2, with the presence of structuring for NM and INPA; however, with correlated allelic frequencies, confirming a common origin. This origin was corroborated by the presence of gene flow through the number of migrants (5.691). Based on these results, there was a moderate genetic variability for INPA and NM and their common origin was confirmed. Recommendations are also included to minimize the probability of inbreeding processes or genetic drift in the studied stocks.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39337/29036,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Resistance profile and virulence characterization of Escherichia coli isolated from diarrheic neonatal farm animals,"Neonatal diarrhea is the main cause of early mortality and morbidity in farm animals and the source of huge, direct and indirect, economic husbandry losses. Escherichia coli, a common harmless commensal bacterium, can turn into a main diarrheal pathogen through antibiotic resistance and the expression of genetically acquired virulence factors. In this study, fecal samples obtained from eight farms of animals with clinical signs characteristic of diarrhea were subjected to culture and bacterial isolation. Colonies suggestive of E. coli were identified through morphological and biochemical characteristics. Susceptibility tests to the main veterinary antibacterial agents were conducted using agar disk diffusion followed by phenotypical detection of extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL). A total of 301 colonies were characterized as E. coli and, out of the 192 that were tested, 134 showed resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial drugs and were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR), and 14 were ESBL positive. Bacterial DNA was extracted for multiplex PCR (mPCR) using primers to detect ten different genes of diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC). Thirty-six bacterial strains were positive in the mPCR assay, 28 of which were classified as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and eight as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The high prevalence of MDR strains and the detection of ESBL denote the presence of resistance genes in animal husbandry; thus, it is important to isolate and characterize those pathogens and test antimicrobial sensitivity in vitro to avoid ineffective treatments and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, which are the major concerns of Public Health and One Health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40548/29077,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Combination of immunostimulants with moxidectin in the treatment of animals experimentally infected with Haemonchus contortus,"Considering the importance of Haemonchus contortus infection in herds along with parasitic resistance, the goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of the administration of adjuvants alone or in combination with anthelmintics for the treatment of H. contortus, in experimentally infected sheep. Thirty sheep of the Texel breed of both genders, raised in a herd located in the subtropical region of Brazil, were used in this experiment. Experimental infection with H. contortus was performed in sheep, and the infected sheep were then separated into groups for the administration of antiparasitic and immunostimulant drugs. The results obtained from the excretion of eggs per gram of feces and the count of parasites during necropsy affirm that the use of adjuvants in combination with anthelmintics is associated with higher efficacy of treatment, lower rate of reinfection, and retardation in the development of anthelmintic drug resistance by H. contortus. Based on these results, we can conclude that the combination of anthelmintics and immunostimulants may favor potential anthelmintic treatments for H. contortus.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40310/29030,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Culinary quality and sensory profile of cassava varieties harvested at different ages,"Sweet cassava must be rapidly cooked and meet the sensory and technological requirements of consumers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the culinary quality of sweet cassava varieties harvested at three ages and obtain the sensory profile of these varieties using the check-all-that-apply method (CATA). Roots of three cassava varieties released or recommended by Embrapa (BRS Aipim Brasil, BRS Dourada and Saracura) and the commercial variety Eucalipto, harvested at nine, 12 and 15 months of age, were evaluated for physical, chemical and sensory aspects. At nine months of age, the Saracura, BRS Aipim Brasil and BRS Dourada varieties did not differ in cooking time, averaging 41.62 min. The Eucalipto variety had similar cooking times at the three harvest ages, averaging 21.83 min. There was a difference between the four varieties at nine months, with Saracura exhibiting the lowest acceptance score (5.0) and differing from the Eucalipto variety, which showed an average score of 6.3. At 12 months of age, there was a significant increase in the acceptance of the Saracura and BRS Aipim Brasil varieties, which did not differ from Eucalipto and had an average score of 6.4. Consumers perceived differences between the sensory characteristics of the cassava varieties using CATA. The sensory terms “creamy”, “soft” and “sticky” can be associated with greater acceptance of cooked cassava roots, whereas terms such as “floury”, “slightly bitter”, “no taste”, “hard” and “fibrous” can be associated with less acceptance and are therefore undesirable from the consumer’s point of view. Principal component analysis showed that the age at which the roots were harvested had a great effect on the culinary quality of cassava, regardless of the evaluated variety. The commercial variety Eucalipto was well-accepted by the consumers irrespective of root age and can be harvested at any of the evaluated ages. For the Saracura, BRS Aipim Brasil and BRS Dourada varieties, harvesting is recommended at 12 or 15 months so that better quality roots are obtained.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41002/29027,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Susceptibility and virulence profile of Escherichia coli pathotypes isolated from diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves,"Neonatal diarrhea is amongst the most frequent diseases affecting calves, leading to damages in milk production. Although Escherichia coli is a commensal microorganism in the gastrointestinal tract, some pathotypes are known to cause high prevalence of diarrhea and food poisoning. The rapidly increasing resistance of bacteria to antimicrobials leads to the research in new, alternative treatment options. The present study aimed at the detection of E. coli pathotypes in newborn diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves, as well as susceptibility tests for antimicrobials and vegetal extracts. Samples were collected from animals located in dairy farms in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The samples were sent for microbiological isolation, genetic identification using PCR and antimicrobial tests. A total of 35 strains from diarrheic animals tested positive for at least one of the virulence genes analyzed: stx1, stx2, eae, bfp and sta. As for the non-diarrheic animals, 9 isolated strains possessed one of or both stx1 and stx2 genes, classifying these non-diarrheic cattle as reservoirs for the STEC pathotype and possible biological vectors of this pathogen. Regarding the susceptibility tests, most isolates displayed resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes. Among the vegetal extracts tested, all isolates tested sensitive to the active ingredient of Salvia officinalis L. (sage).

42,2021,"Hygienic-health quality and microbiological hazard of clandestine Minas Frescal cheese commercialized in north Tocantins, Brazil","Cheese is a popular product that integrates the diet of the majority of the population, almost on a daily basis. It is rich in nutrients and, therefore, also an excellent substrate for the multiplication of microorganisms, including pathogens. The microbiological contamination of these products is highly relevant to the industry, resulting in an economic loss, and to public health, due to the risk of causing foodborne diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hygienic-sanitary quality and the presence of bacterial pathogens in the clandestine Minas Frescal cheeses sold in the street open markets of Araguaína, TO, Brazil. Twenty-one samples were collected to evaluate the presence of total (TC) and thermotolerant (TTC) coliforms, Escherichia coli, and the pathotypes enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. The results showed that 100% of the cheese samples were in disagreement with the maximum standards of TC and TTC defined in the Brazilian legislation that regulates food quality control. In addition, 85.71% of the samples had values above the standard Brazilian maximum limit. In the study of diarrheagenic E. coli, 52.38%, 66.6%, and 4.76% of the samples were positive for EPEC, STEC, and EHEC, respectively, indicating fecal origin contamination of the samples and a potential consumer risk. No Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes were detected in these cheese samples. The high count of total and thermotolerant coliforms found in the samples demonstrates unsatisfactory sanitary conditions in the production, storage, and/or commercialization of this food product. The presence of EPEC, STEC, EHEC, and coagulase-positive staphylococci at high concentrations shows the health risk of the imminent consumption of Minas Frescal cheese.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41052/29028,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Agronomical and quality differences of four fig cultivars grown in Brazil,"Figs consumption date back to the beginnings of civilization. Currently, consumers have become more demanding about quality of fruits, and figs are then highly indicated, since it is rich in nutrients, making them a great addition to a healthy diet. Although there is only one commercial fig cultivar that is commonly grown in Brazil, different cultivars should be considered for the diversification of fig production with regards to their yield and fruit quality. This research aimed at evaluating growth, yield, physicochemical characteristics and bioactive compounds of figs grown in Brazil. Then, four cultivars (Roxo de Valinhos, White Genova, PI-189 and Troyano) were studied to determine canopy volume, productive efficiency, soluble solids - SS, pH, titratable acidity - TA, SS/TA ratio, sugars, ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, pigments and antioxidant activity. The cv. White Genova presented the highest canopy volume, while ‘Roxo de Valinhos’, ‘PI-189’ and ‘Troyano’ performed the greatest productive efficiency. The cvs. Roxo de Valinhos, White Genova and Troyano produced fruits with higher content of SS, reducing sugars and SS/TA ratio, while the fruits of ‘PI-189’ and ‘Roxo de Valinhos’ contained the highest levels of antioxidant activity.

This study aimed to determine the effect of MMs on shoot and root biomass production; gas exchange; content of macronutrients in the shoots, roots and grains; yield components; and grain yield of common bean plants. A completely randomized design with twenty-six treatments and three replications was used under controlled conditions. Treatments consisted of the application of MMs and their combinations in pairs, with the nine rhizobacteria isolates BRM 32109, BRM 32110 and 1301 (Bacillus sp.), BRM 32111 and BRM 32112 (Pseudomonas sp.), BRM 32113 (Burkholderia sp.), BRM 32114 (Serratia sp.), 1381 (Azospirillum sp.) and Ab-V5 (Azospirillum brasilense); an edaphic fungal isolate T-26 (Trichoderma koningiopsis); and a control (without MMs). These MMs were applied at three time points: microbiolization of the seeds, watering the soil seven days after sowing (DAS) and spraying the plants with 21 DAS. In comparison to the control plants, the isolates 1301 and T-26, in addition to the combinations Ab-V5 + T-26, BRM 32114 + BRM 32110 and 1381 + T-26, provided better results, with an increase of 36.5% in the grain yield, a higher accumulation of biomass (78.0%) and a higher content of N, P and K (42.6, 67.8 and 25.7%, respectively) in the shoots of common bean plants. Therefore, the results allow us to infer that the use of MMs is a good strategy for increasing common bean grain yields.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40949/29019,E-ISSN 1679-0359

BRS Rubi do Cerrado irrigated with waters of different cationic natures. The experiment was carried out from March 2019 to January 2020 in a protected environment belonging to the Academic Unit of Agricultural Engineering of the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Campina Grande, PB, Brazil. The treatments consisted of eight combinations of irrigation water with different cationic natures: S1 - Control; S2 - Na+; S3 - Ca2+; S4 - Mg2+; S5 - Na+ + Ca2+; S6 - Na+ + Mg2+; S7 - Ca2+ + Mg2+, and S8 - Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+. Plants in the control treatment (S1) were irrigated using water with an electrical conductivity (ECw) of 0.4 dS m-1, while the other treatments (S2; S3; S4; S5; S6; S7; and S8) were subjected to an ECw of 3.5 dS m-1. Sour passion fruit growth was affected by variations in the level of electrical conductivity, regardless of the cationic nature of irrigation water. The use of salinized water with sodium favored the synthesis of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids of passion fruit plants at 180 days after transplanting.

42,2021,Nutrient content and accumulation in sugarcane under mineral fertilization and high doses of vinasse,"Vinasse, a waste from ethanol production, has been widely used as a means of fertigation in sugarcane. However, high dose limits application at and its effects on nutrient absorption and accumulation by the crop are not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare, during the initial development of sugarcane, the effect of mineral fertilization and high doses of vinasse on the macronutrient and sodium contents of the top visible dewlap (TVD) leaf and their respective accumulations in the aerial part of the crop. The experiment was carried out in 100-dm3 pots filled with Argisol. The treatments consisted of five doses of vinasse (0, 150, 300, 600 and 1200 m3 ha-1) and an additional treatment with no vinasse and mineral fertilizer (500 kg ha-1 of the NPK 14-24-18 formulation). The levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium were evaluated in the TVD leaf at 120 days after planting and their accumulation in the aerial part of the plant at 210 days. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and compared using regression analysis and orthogonal contrasts. The vinasse doses applied did not adequately nourish the crop in macronutrients. Mineral fertilization provided higher N and P levels. The highest doses of vinasse provided higher levels of K, Ca and Mg and larger accumulations of N, P, K and Na, but were detrimental to the accumulation of Ca. The descending order of accumulation of macronutrients and sodium with mineral fertilization was P> Ca> N> K> Mg> Na. For the application of vinasse, the descending order was K> P> Ca> N> Na> Mg. In the absence of mineral fertilization and vinasse, the descending order was P> Ca> K> N> Mg> Na.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40561/29017,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Water samples were collected from two micro-watersheds with different land uses (regenerated savanna and an agricultural site) from January 2014 to April 2015. In the rainy season, the samples were collected every 15 days, while in the dry season, samples were collected every 30 days. An automatic sampler in the stream collected the composed samples. Water flow was monitored with a sensor that measured the hydraulic load on the sill of the triangular spillway installed in each micro-watershed. The DOC and NO3 contents were analyze via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The flow was estimated based on the DOC and NO3 flows and concentrations. The DOC concentrations were higher in the Cerrado micro-watershed; however, there was no difference in NO3 concentrations. In both watersheds, there was a significant increase in the concentrations of DOC and NO3 on rainy days, with was more pronounced in the agricultural watershed. The DOC and NO3 flows were higher in the micro-watershed with Cerrado vegetation on days with rain; while on days without rain, there was no difference.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40177/29016,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Pre-soaking with gibberellin in sweet corn seed lots with different levels of vigor,"A reduzida longevidade e o baixo desempenho de sementes de milho doce justificam a adoção de práticas que potencializem sua qualidade, como a pré-embebição. Neste sentido, objetivou-se avaliar os efeitos da pré-embebição com giberelina no potencial fisiológico de dois lotes de sementes de milho doce, com níveis de vigor contrastantes, em condições ideais e de estresse hídrico. Inicialmente, os lotes de sementes utilizados foram caracterizados quanto a germinação e potencial fisiológico - através dos testes: primeira contagem, germinação envelhecimento acelerado, teste de frio, comprimento de plântulas normais, massa seca de plântulas normais, emergência em campo, índice de velocidade de emergência e teste de tetrazólio. Posteriormente, as sementes foram submetidas a diferentes tratamentos de pré-embebição, em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 2 × 4, com quatro repetições, sendo dois lotes e quatro tratamentos de pré-embebição: com água e com solução de ácido giberélico à 0,4 g L-1 e à 0,8 g L-1, além do controle (sem pré-embebição). Em seguida, as sementes foram submetidas aos testes de primeira contagem e germinação em condições de deficiência hídrica simulada, além dos testes de grau de umidade, primeira contagem, germinação, emergência em campo e índice de velocidade de emergência. Os dados obtidos foram submetidos a análise de variância e comparação de médias, pelo teste de Tukey e pelo teste t de Student, para comparação entre os tratamentos e os lotes, respectivamente. A pré-embebição favoreceu a velocidade e porcentagem de germinação das sementes de milho doce, principalmente em condições de déficit hídrico. A pré-embebição somente com água, no lote de maior vigor, e com ácido giberélico à 0,4 g L-1, no lote de menor vigor, favorece o desempenho fisiológico das sementes avaliadas.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40014/29015,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Optimal plot size in buckwheat,"The aim of this work was to compare three methods of estimating the optimal plot size for evaluating fresh matter in the IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench). Sixteen uniformity trials (blank experiments) were conducted, eight with the IPR91-Baili cultivar and eight with the IPR92-Altar cultivar. The trials were carried out at eight different sowing times. The fresh matter was evaluated in 576 basic experimental units (BEU), each 1 m × 1 m in size (36 BEU per trial). The optimal plot size was determined using the method of modified maximum curvature, the linear response plateau model and the quadratic response plateau model. The optimal plot size differs between methods, and decreases in the following order: quadratic response plateau model, linear response plateau model and modified maximum curvature. The optimal plot size for evaluating fresh matter in the IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars of buckwheat is 7.60 m2. This size can be used as a reference for future experiments with buckwheat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39448/29330,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Correlation between vigor by accelerated aging at pre-sowing and soybean seedling emergence in the field,"Although the accelerated aging test is widely used to determine seed vigor, there are methodological variations in seed exposure time at 41 °C. Therefore, the objective was to indicate the most appropriate seed exposure time to segregate lots that also exhibits a correlation with seedling emergence in the field, and establish vigor levels using the aforementioned test. Soybean seed samples were collected at pre-sowing, representing 100 lots in the 2016/2017 growing season and 125 lots in the 2017/2018 season from different warehouses in 4 regions of Santa Catarina state (SC). Physiological quality was evaluated by germination, accelerated aging (24 and 48 h at 41 °C) and field emergence tests. The results were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and Pearson’s correlation analysis (p < 0.05). The rank sum index, associated with the Scott-Knott clustering method, was used to classify physiological quality. The average germination percentage was 90 and 91% in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 growing seasons, respectively. Vigor obtained an average of 86 (2016/2017) and 85% (2017/2018), when seeds were submitted to accelerated aging for 48 h, and 89% (both seasons) for 24 h. In regard to field emergence, the average was 85 and 80% in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 growing seasons, respectively. Considering the 225 lots, the greatest correlation with field emergence was observed in vigor - 48 h (r = 0.71 p < 0.05). Rank sum classification made it possible to establish vigor-based categories, whereby batches with over 85% vigor by 48-h accelerated aging were classified as high vigor, 70 to 84% medium vigor, and under 70% low vigor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37771/29009,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Fruit production and quality of mini-watermelon with different number of stems, in troughs cultivation system and substrate reuse","Substrate-filled pots are growing systems commonly used for vegetable farming. However, few are the studies available relating them to mini-watermelon cultivation. Our study presents a growing system using substrate-filled troughs and leachate recirculation as a low-cost and less environmentally harmful soilless cultivation system for mini-watermelons. For a growing system to be viable and provide high fruit yield and quality, several aspects must be studied, including substrate physical properties and reuse potential in successive crops, besides plant management-related aspects. Therefore, our goal was to evaluate the effects of a trough system and substrate reuse on changes in the properties of raw rice husk and on fruit yield and quality for mini-watermelons at different stem training. To this purpose, two trials were conducted using nutrient solution recirculation systems. In the first, we evaluated the effects of pot and trough systems. In the second, first- and second-use substrates were compared in the trough system. In both trials, one and two-stem training systems were analyzed. The results of the first trial show that the trough system had a greater positive impact on substrate water holding capacity (WHC), which increased from 7.9 to 15.6%, while the pots increased substrate WHC only to 11.2%. However, both systems neither affected fruit yield (8 kg/m² on average) nor fruit quality. The two-stem training promoted higher fruit yields (4.2 kg/plant) and contents of total soluble solids - TSS (11.4 °Brix) but did not affect average fruit weight. Moreover, the one-stem training provided higher fruit number (7.3 fruits/m²) and fruit yield (9.7 kg/m²). In the second trial, the reused substrate showed a higher WHC (12.4%) than the one used for the first time (9.9%). The reused substrate also provided better results in terms of fruit yield and quality (5.9 fruits/m², 5.3 kg/m², and 10.5o Brix). In the second trial, two-stem training also increased average fruit weight, and hence yields per plant. Nevertheless, the stem number did not affect fruit number per plant, fruit yield per square meter, and fruit quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38059/29024,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,"Toxoplasmosis outbreak in sheep in northern-central Paraná, Brazil","In this study, we aimed to investigate an outbreak of abortion in a herd of beef sheep on a property in Ivaiporã, north central Paraná, Brazil. A total of 64 blood samples were collected from the sheep, 33 of which were mothers with reports of abortion or stillbirth, and 7 with weak lamb birth. For epidemiological investigation of the parasite, fourteen samples were collected from different sources on the property, six from water, three from soil, one from trough, and four from feed. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) analysis and polymerase chain reaction were performed for detecting anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in the sheep and molecular identification of the protozoan in the environment, respectively. The IFI results showed that 95.3% of the sheep were seropositive for anti-T. gondii antibodies; however, the environmental samples tested negative. During the visit to the property and interview with the owner, free-roaming cats were observed on the property for biological control of rodents that had access to the food deposits. This type of management may have triggered the outbreak, which reinforces the importance of preventive management and veterinary medical monitoring on sheep farms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39549/29178,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Zinc application improves growth, yield and grain zinc concentration of mung bean (Vigna radiata L.)","Minerals’ deficiency, including iodine (I), vitamin A, iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) is a widespread threat to mankind. Around 2 billion people (children, women, and people of middle age group) across the globe suffer from mineral deficiencies. The productivity of mung bean is very low in arid and semi-arid regions due to little or no application of fertilizers. Majority of mung bean growing regions of Pakistan have low Zn concentration in soils. This study evaluated the impact of different Zn sources and their application methods on allometry, yield and grain biofortification of mung bean. Mung bean variety “Azri 2006” was used as experimental material. Three different Zn sources, i.e., zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), Zn-EDDHA and 50 % ZnSO4 + 50% Zn EDDHA. Application method included in the study was basal application, foliar application and 50% basal + 50% foliar application. The results indicated that Zn application improved allometric traits and productivity of mungbean. The ZnSO4 source of Zn with basal application resulted in the highest chlorophyll contents, leaf area index, number of sympodial and monopodial branches, and number of pods per plant, 1000-seeds weight, biological yield and seed yield as compared to control treatment. In conclusion, 10 kg ha-1 Zn application as basal application method seemed a viable option to improve mung bean productivity along with higher grain Zn biofortification.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39303/29023,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Methodology of the tetrazolium test for identifying viable seeds of orchids of the genus Cattleya native to the Brazilian Cerrado,"Orchids need measures for conservation of their species, among them the creation of seed banks. This study analyzes suitable methodologies to identify the viability of Cattleya seeds through the tetrazolium test. Seeds of Cattleya nobilior Rchb. and Cattleya walkeriana Gardn. were submitted to three preconditioning: no soaking (control); sucrose (10%); or distilled water. After 24 hours, they were submitted to tetrazolium solution with three types of conditioning: oven (40 °C); water bath (40 °C); or room temperature. Subsequently, the percentage of viable seeds (VS) was calculated and in vitro sowing was carried out. Germination percentage (G) was determined after 45 days. A completely randomized design was used for each species studied, with treatments arranged in a 3x3 factorial scheme (three preconditioning and three conditioning), with eight replicates of one tube each. The experiment was performed in duplicate. The highest viability values found in the tetrazolium test were close to those of germination (C. nobilior: VS = 88% e G = 97%; C. walkeriana: VS = 88% e G = 95%) for Cattleya species native to the Cerrado. The conditioning at ambient temperature had a greater effect on seed visualization for both species studied, suggesting that the tetrazolium test should be performed at this conditioning temperature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40227/29177,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Standardization of blood meal production process at a rendering plant using design of experiments,"This research focuses on the standardization of the blood meal production process at a Colombian rendering plant through a design of experiments. Initially, 108 samples of blood meal were taken where only 23% achieved the moisture target (7.5% to 8.5%). Therefore, an analysis of the measurement system was performed using a repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) study. Results showed that 39.96% of the observed variability was caused by the measurement system that was out of control. So, it was necessary to improve the method of sampling reducing the participation of the measurement system in the variability of the process to only 3.79%. Later, several experiments were accomplished with a 2k factorial design. Each experiment consisted of a response variable (blood meal moisture), two controllable factors (drying chamber temperature and percentage of rotation of the metering screw), and an uncontrollable factor (initial blood meal moisture). Finally, experiments were carried out and validated observing that, with a drying chamber temperature of 160 °C and a percentage of screw rotation of 29%, more than 97% of the blood meal was according to the moisture target. In conclusion, is confirmed that the design of experiments is a tool that allows a clear path towards optimization and standardization of processes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42081/29191,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Obtaining microsatellite markers for Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum using heterologous primers,"Studies on genetic composition in fish populations contribute to conservationist practices and inbreeding control in fish stocks. To this end, molecular tools such as microsatellite markers (SSRs) are often used, but they are expensive and time-consuming to develop. A species-specific heterologous marker emerges as an alternative, which can be used in taxonomically related species in a fast way. Our goal was to test SSRs markers of Brachyplatystoma rousseauxi and Pseudoplatystoma punctifer in P. reticulatum in an unprecedented way. For this purpose, DNA was extracted from fragments of the caudal fin of 222 P. reticulatum adults, using a NaCl-based method. Then, DNA samples were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using six markers, four from B. rousseauxi (BR38, 47, 51, and 61) and two from P. punctifer (PPU13 and PPU15). Two primers showed non-specific amplification and were disregarded (BR38 and PPU13). In the remaining four primers, the number of alleles per locus varied between two (BR47) to sixteen (BR51), and the average size of alleles was between 142 and 400 bp. Mean effective number of alleles per locus ranged from 10,650 (BR51) to 1,784 (BR47), with null or low-frequency alleles in all studied loci. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.299 (BR47) to 0.640 (BR51) and was always lower than the expected heterozygosity. Hardy-Weinberg balance was significant (p < 0.05) in all loci, and inbreeding coefficient (FIS) was always positive. Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) confirmed the efficiency of the markers since they had moderate (BR47) to high levels of information (BR51, BR61, and PPU15). Transferability test showed that the heterologous microsatellite molecular markers, originally for B. rousseauxi and P. punctifer, were efficient in P. reticulatum, producing three primers with high information content. Therefore, these markers can be safely used in future population studies of this species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41215/29175,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Use of near-infrared spectroscopy for prediction of chemical composition of Tifton 85 grass,"The reduction in the quality, consumption, and digestibility of forage can cause a decrease in animal performance, resulting in losses to the rural producer. Thus, it is important to monitor these characteristics in forage plants to devise strategies or practices that optimize production systems. The aim of this study was to develop and validate prediction models using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the chemical composition of Tifton 85 grass. Samples of green grass, its morphological structures (whole plant, leaf blade, stem + sheath, and senescent material) and hay, totaling 105 samples were used. Conventional chemical analysis was performed to determine the content of oven-dried samples (ODS), mineral matter (MM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), cellulose (CEL), hemicellulose (HEM), and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD). Subsequently, all the samples were scanned using a Vis-NIR spectrometer to collect spectral data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data set, and modified partial least squares was used to correlate reference values to spectral data. The coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.74, 0.85, 0.98, 0.75, 0.85, 0.71, 0.82, 0.77, and 0.93, and the ratio of performance deviations (RPD) obtained were 1.99, 2.71, 6.46, 2.05, 2.58, 3.84, 1.86, 2.35, 2.09, and 3.84 for ODS, MM, CP, NDF, ADF, ADL, CEL, HEM, and IVDMD, respectively. The prediction models obtained, in general, were considered to be of excellent quality, and demonstrated that the determination of the chemical composition of Tifton 85 grass can be performed using NIRS technology, replacing conventional analysis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40793/29173,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Comparison of random regression models, traditional animal model and with the inclusion of molecular markers in the estimation of genetic parameters in Colombian Holstein cattle","The use of molecular markers to identify desirable genes in animal production is known as marker-assisted selection. The traditional genetic evaluation model uses the BLUP methodology; when genetic markers are included in the evaluation model, the methodology is known as M-BLUP. In contrast, random regression models (RRM), unlike the models based on production at 305 days, consider factors that change for each animal from one test to another. The objective of this study was to compare variance components, genetic parameters and breeding values for milk production, protein percentage and somatic cell score in Colombian Holstein cattle using BLUP, M-BLUP and RRM. For the estimation of genetic parameters and values, 2003 lactations corresponding to 1417 cows in 55 herds were used, and effects of the order of delivery, herd, and contemporary group were included. The three traits presented greater heritability under the MBLUP model: 0.44 for protein percentage, 0.27 for milk production and 0.28 for somatic cell score. This was because the genetic variance was greater when M-BLUP was used, which allowed a greater accuracy of the breeding value estimation in the three traits. Therefore, the model that includes information on molecular markers is more suitable for genetic evaluation in Colombian Holstein cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41064/29174,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The treatments were: corn silage without inoculant (control); with 11CFT inoculant (strains of Lactobacillus buchneri and Lactobacillus casei) and with 11C33 inoculant (Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium) with six repetitions each. Ingestive behavior, weight gain and daily dry matter intake was not affected by the use of inoculants in corn silage. The apparent digestibility of diet was higher to silage with 11C33 inoculant, not differing from the diet with silage with 11CFT (73.30% and 71.99%, respectively). The animals fed silage inoculated with 11CFT obtained greater values of carcass gain and average daily carcass gain (86.33 kg and 0.833 kg day-1, respectively).

A completely randomized design was adopted involving 20 multiparous, lactating crossbred cows from a dairy farm located in the municipality of Turvânia - GO, Brazil. During the experimental period, data on behavioral, productive, reproductive and thermoregulatory traits were collected every 15 days. Bioestat (5.0) statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The mean temperature-humidity index, ambient temperature and relative humidity obtained throughout the experimental period were 74.45, 30.51 ºC and 63.64%, respectively. In terms of reproductive performance, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the genetic compositions for the time from calving to first service, with a longer period shown by the animals with greater Holstein breed genetic composition. Service period and calving interval differed significantly (p < 0.05) during the experimental period between the genetic compositions. A significant difference (p < 0.05) was also detected between the compositions for respiratory rate, with higher values observed in the animals with higher European genetic composition. Benezra thermal comfort index also differed significantly (p < 0.05), with the 7/8 HG animals showing a higher value. Lactating cows with a 7/8 HG genetic composition achieved better results in milk production, whereas those with 3/4 HG genetic composition showed superiority in milk fat composition and reproductive and thermoregulatory performance, indicating greater adaptation to the climatic conditions of the region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40378/29170,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Acerola seed meal (Malpighia emarginata) as a source of dietary fibre in starter piglet diets,"Three experiments were carried out to determine the nutritional value and the effect of acerola seed meal (ASM) for starter piglet diets on feed digestibility, nitrogen balance (NB), growth performance and blood metabolites. Twenty-four crossbred entire male piglets (21.07 ± 3.07 kg) were assigned to a digestibility assay (Exp. I) and distributed in a randomised block design (RBD) with two treatments composed of reference diet (RD) or test diet (20% replacement with ASM), 12 replications and with one pig per experimental unit (EU). An NB study (Exp. II) was conducted with four levels of ASM (0, 4, 8 and 12%) and 24 crossbred entire male piglets (20.78 ± 1.84 kg) allocated in an RBD of six replications and one pig per EU. The growth performance study (Exp. III) involved 120 crossbred piglets: 60 entire males and 60 females (13.85 ± 1.49 kg). Treatments consisted of a gender combination and five levels of ASM (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12%), distributed in an RBD with six replications and four animals per EU. The physicochemical composition results indicated 86.12% of dry matter (DM), 8.03% of crude protein (CP) and 4,553 kcal kg-1 of gross energy (GE) as well as apparent digestibility coefficients of 39.04 and 28.21% for CP and GE, respectively. The levels of ASM that provided the maximum estimate for final body weight, daily body weight gain and average daily feed intake were 2.93% (p = 0.037), 3.05% (p = 0.040) and 4.27% (p = 0.043), respectively. ASM can be indicated as a dietary fibre source for starter piglet diets because it contains relevant nutritional and energy values, without affecting the nitrogen balance and blood urea concentration.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40039/29168,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Carnauba wax coating preserves the internal quality of commercial eggs during storage,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the internal quality and lipid oxidation of eggs coated with a carnauba wax-based product at different concentrations and stored for up to 28 days under two temperatures. For analysis of internal quality, the eggs were assigned to a completely randomized 3 x 4 factorial design (uncoated eggs (control); eggs coated with carnauba wax at 12% concentration (Aruá®); eggs coated with carnauba wax at 15% concentration (Aruá®); four storage periods - 7, 14, 21, and 28 days). Fifteen eggs from each treatment were evaluated in each storage period, with each egg representing one replicate, i.e., 300 eggs per storage temperature (10 and 25°C). Egg weight loss, yolk percent (%), albumen percent (%), Haugh unit, yolk index, and specific gravity were calculated. Lipid oxidation of the egg yolk was measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), using 10 eggs at time 0 (fresh) and 30 eggs in each storage period (7, 14, 21, and 28 days), in triplicate, under only one storage temperature (25°C). A total of five pools, consisting of two eggs each, were used for each treatment. Each pool was considered a replicate, and each treatment consisted of five replicates. The weight loss of the eggs stored at 10°C and 25°C during the storage period was, on average, 46.1% and 37.3% lower for the eggs coated with carnauba wax than in uncoated eggs, respectively. Overall, coated eggs, regardless the concentration of the wax (12 or 15%) had higher Haugh units, specific gravity, and yolk index than uncoated eggs, in both temperatures (10 and 25°C). Uncoated and coated eggs showed similar lipid oxidation values regardless of the storage period. On the other hand, eggs coated with solutions containing 15% wax showed less oxidation than eggs coated with 12% wax. The coating of commercial eggs with carnauba wax, both at concentrations of 12 and 15%, was effective in maintaining their internal quality during storage at both storage temperatures (10 and 25°C). Eggs stored at 25°C had lower quality traits during storage compared with eggs kept under refrigeration. Coating eggs with wax did not minimize the oxidative processes in the egg yolk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40315/29257,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Effect of particle size on storage time of hydrated corn grain,"Dry ground corn kernels are widely used as sources of energy readily available for microbial synthesis in the rumen. The objective of the present study was to measure the effect of particle size on the storage length of rehydrated and ensiled corn grain. Commercial corn was milled in 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-mm sieves, rehydrated until reaching 65% DM, and ensiled for 14, 28, and 56 days, in a completely randomized design with a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement, with six replications per treatment. PVC mini-silos were used, with dimensions of 25 cm height x 10 cm of diameter. The variables DM, MM, CP, NDF, ADF, pH, molds and yeasts count, fermentative losses, in vitro degradability and aerobic stability were subjected to analysis of variance. The Tukey test was used to compare means. LAB counts was subjected to Wilcoxon's non-parametric test, considering significance at p < 0.05. Rehydrated corn silages with smaller particles (2 and 4 mm) showed higher LAB and mold counts, higher levels of CP and EE and higher density at opening silos than that of coarser particles. However, they showed lower percentages of DM, and were susceptible to microbial attack and faster temperature increases than were coarse particles during the chosen storage times. Silage subjected to 56 days of fermentation showed lower contents of NDF, ADF and CP, lower gas losses and lower pH values in aerobiosis, and increased levels of soluble protein (A + B1 fractions), losses by effluents, number of hours to reach maximum temperature, and time to break aerobic stability. Coarse-grind silages subjected to 56 days of storage showed better chemical composition, lower LAB and mold counts, and less susceptibility to microbial degradation when exposed to air.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39958/29192,E-ISSN 1679-0359

After cooling for 24 h, the carcasses were evaluated for hot carcass weight, pH, conformation, physiological maturity, finishing, fat distribution, and length. Characteristics, such as pH, color, marbling, exudation, as well as cooking losses, percentage of ether extract, and shear force were evaluated in meat at time zero and after seven days of aging. The carcasses displayed satisfactory results for parameters such as pH at 24 h of cooling (pH24), finishing, distribution of fat, and subcutaneous fat thickness (5.58, 3.27, 2.40, and 6.62 mm, respectively). The meat had a low marbling score (5.08) and percentage of ether extract (1.71), indicating that the meat was relatively lean. Exudation and cooking losses showed similar results at zero and seven days of aging. The meat subjected to seven days of aging showed higher lightness and hue (40.98 and 0.77, respectively) and tenderness of 5.25 kg. These results indicated that aging affected meat color and shear force parameters; the meat of cross-heifers was softer but less red after maturation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39753/29166,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Viability of Brazilian distillers dried grains with solubles for pigs,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance, carcass, meat and economic viability characteristics of pigs fed Brazilian coproducts of corn ethanol production. A total of 40 finishing pigs were subjected to four levels of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS; 0, 100, 200, or 300 g kg-1) for 28 days, and body weight, daily feed intake, daily weight gain and feed conversion were measured. After slaughter, the carcass yield, fat thickness, loin eye area, the depth and perimeter of the loin eye, and the pH and temperature at 45 min and 24 h post-mortem, along with the drip loss and color of the Longissimus lumborum were evaluated. The economic viability of the diets was calculated. The inclusion of DDGS showed a quadratic effect on daily feed intake over 0-14 days. Pigs fed with 300 g kg -1 of DDGS showed worse feed conversion than those fed the control diet over 0-7, 0-14 and 0-21 days. The a* color parameter of the meat decreased linearly with increasing DDGS concentration but the other carcass and meat characteristics were not affected. Inclusion of 184.1 g kg -1 of DDGS showed the best economic viability, considering the cost of weight gain. DDGS may be included in pig diets up to 200 g kg -1 without affecting the performance or carcass and meat characteristics, while 300 g kg -1 compromises feed conversion.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39745/29165,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,"Main causes of chicken carcass condemnations in Espírito Santo, Brazil","Brazil is the third largest producer and the main exporter of chicken meat in the world. In 2019, it produced approximately 13.245 million tons of the product, generating more than six million dollars. According to the Poultry Association of the state of Espírito Santo, broiler production is carried out by 28 independent producers/companies, three integrator businesses, 42 integrated producers and seven slaughterhouses (structures with SIF, SIE/SISBI or SIE certification). Despite the growth of this sector, problems persist regarding the quality of carcasses and the number of condemnations. From the sanitary and industrial point of view, all products of animal origin must undergo prior inspection. The present study was developed using data generated by the Federal Inspection Service (Serviço de Inspeção Federal, SIF) and the State Inspection Service (Serviço de Inspeção Estadual, SIE). The main causes of condemnation of birds as inspected by SIF represented 9.26% of the slaughtered birds. Total condemnations corresponded to 1.35%. Overall, this study recorded a greater number of condemnations of non-pathological origin. In conclusion, there was consistency in the reasons why these products were condemned. Bruises/fractures and contamination were the most frequent causes according to both inspection services (SIF and SIE), indicating a common problem on the slaughter and inspection lines.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40728/29163,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Sheep urinary tract architecture is not affected by acute urethral obstruction,"Urolithiasis affects the urinary tract of small ruminants, thereby requiring the animal to prematurely terminate breeding. Morphometric study of organs can be used as a diagnostic method. Thus, this study aimed to describe the macroscopic, histopathological, and histomorphometric changes in the urinary tract of sheep with urolithiasis. For this purpose, 14 healthy male Santa Inês sheep, approximately 90 days old, were studied and fed an experimental diet. After the development of urolithiasis, the animals were reorganized into two groups, D1 (without urolithiasis) and D2 (with urolithiasis) for comparative data analysis. Sheep were necropsied to evaluate the pathological changes, followed by macroscopic morphometric analysis, and the histopathological and histomorphometric characteristics were described. Urethral necrosis and a full urinary bladder were observed in all animals that developed the disease. The comparison between sheep with and without urolithiasis showed no significant difference (P < 0.05) in the evaluated macroscopic morphometric variables, except for the right ureter width. Regarding the histopathological evaluation, multifocal areas of mild to moderate congestion within the glomerular tufts and protein in the tubular lumen of the kidneys were observed. In the liver, mild to moderate fatty degeneration was noted in the centrolobular regions, and an ulcerated focal area in the bladder mucosa was observed in only one animal. The present study demonstrated that the formulated diet was effective in inducing clinical disease. In acute obstructive urolithiasis in sheep tissue, lesions in the liver and urinary tract were observed, although there were no significant histomorphometric changes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38390/29161,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Metabolic status of crossbred Charolais × Nellore cows throughout the final third of gestation and lactation,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolic status of beef cows during the final third of gestation and thereafter until the end of the subsequent breeding season. The study was conducted using 30 beef cows, aged between 4 and 11 years, derived from crosses between Charolais and Nellore cattle. To assess the metabolic status of cows, we obtained measurements of body weight and condition (BW and BCS), and complemented these by analyzing the following blood metabolites: total proteins, globulins, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Assessments were performed at 95 days pre-calving, and again at 7, 21, 63, and 110 days post-calving. The experimental design was completely randomized with five collection periods and 30 repetitions (cows). The BW of cows was found to be highest at 110 days postpartum (489.1 kg), and loss of BW was observed between 21 and 63 days postpartum (-3.72 kg). The lowest BCS value was recorded after 63 days of lactation (2.85 points). With respect to blood metabolites, concentrations of total proteins were higher at 7 and 110 days postpartum relative to the levels recorded during gestation (8.3 and 8.3 vs. 7.7 g dL-1, respectively), whereas serum globulin levels were higher at 7, 21, and 110 days postpartum relative to those at gestation (5.2, 5.2, and 5.1 vs. 4.8 g dL -1, respectively). Compared with samples obtained during gestation, the highest levels of albumin (P < 0.05) were observed at 7, 63, and 110 days postpartum (3.1, 3.1, and 3.2 vs. 2.9 g dL-1, respectively). Serum glucose was higher during pregnancy and in the first week of lactation relative to the values recorded after 21 and 63 days of lactation (80.9 and 76.7 vs 71.5 and 72.3 mg dL-1, respectively). Moreover, cholesterol concentrations increased with the progression of lactation, with the highest value being recorded at 110 days postpartum (222.1 mg dL-1). Collectively, the findings of this study, indicate that Charolais × Nellore cows raised exclusively on native pasture mobilize body reserves, lose weight, and show a negative energy balance during the first weeks of lactation, with detrimental consequences for subsequent reproductive activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40770/29171,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Salinomycin intoxication in pigs associated with the use of tiamulin in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil","This paper describes a spontaneous outbreak of toxic myopathy in finishing pigs due to the ingestion of feed with salinomycin associated with tiamulin and addresses the control methods performed during the outbreak to minimize economic losses resulting from the intoxication. A lot of 940 pigs fed feed containing 30 ppm salinomycin received 100 ppm tiamulin (via water) to control recurrent respiratory diseases on the farm. After ingesting tiamulin, some animals manifested clinical signs of motor incoordination, stiff gait, reluctance to move, muscle weakness and tremors, dyspnea, depression, and decubitus, remaining in “sitting-dog position” or with the abduction of the pelvic limbs, and rested on tip-toes when in a standing position. Two animals were euthanized for macro-and microscopic evaluation. The other sick animals received supportive anti-inflammatory treatment. The most relevant macroscopic finding observed during necropsy was the slight pallor of the pelvic limb muscles. The main histopathological findings consisted of multifocal areas of hyaline degeneration and marked necrosis of skeletal myofibers, with macrophage infiltrate associated with cell regeneration and skeletal fiber phagocytosis. These lesions were more intense in the longissimus dorsi, diaphragm, and masseter muscles. The definitive diagnosis was based on epidemiological aspects and clinical lesional conditions compatible with toxic myopathy secondary to ionophore intoxication.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38248/29189,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,SO2-generating pads reduce gray mold in clamshell-packaged ‘Rubi’ table grapes grown under a two-cropping per year system,"The aim of this work was to evaluate different SO2-generating pads and liners to control gray mold in ventilated clamshell-packaged ‘Rubi’ table grapes grown under a two-cropping per year system. The treatments consisted of SO2-generating pads (slow release or dual release) and plastic liners with different perforations (microperforated; 2.0; 4.0 or 5.0 mm in diameter) and a control, only with the standard microperforated plastic liner. The packaged grapes were stored in a cold chamber at 1.0 ± 1.0 °C and 95% relative humidity. After 45 days, the grapes were removed from cold storage and placed, without liners and SO2-generating pads, for 3 days at room temperature (22.0 ± 1.0 °C). The evaluations occurred at 30 and 45 days after the beginning of cold storage, and the following variables were assessed: incidence of gray mold, mass loss, stem browning and shattered berries. At 3 days of shelf-life, the same variables were assessed, except mass loss. The completely randomized design was used as a statistical model with four replications, and each plot consisted of five bunches individually stored in ventilated clamshell-packaged. The dual release SO2-generating pads are efficient in controlling the gray mold in ‘Rubi’ table grapes regardless of the type of perforation of the plastic liners, with low mass loss and shattered berries, with good conservation of the freshness of the rachis. The disease was efficiently controlled in both annual crops. The slow-release SO2-generating pads, regardless of the type of perforation of the plastic liners, resulted in intermediate efficiency of gray mold control, with good physical quality of the bunches. Thus, the use of dual release SO2-generating pads is recommended to control gray mold in ventilated clamshell-packaged ‘Rubi’ table grapes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41365/29185,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Sodium content in meat products: suitability to labeling and the voluntary agreements,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the sodium concentration in meat products, to ascertain their appropriateness for labels and agreements set up between the Health Ministry and the Brazilian Association of Food Industries. A total of 96 meat derivative samples (italian salami, chicken pate, cooked ham, ham, sausage, bologna, tuscan sausage and smoked mixed sausage) were collected from different brands and batches. Using flame emission spectroscopy, the samples were analyzed for sodium levels based on the official methodology. It was observed that 46.9% of the companies showed values in nutritional labeling to be noncompliant with the Brazilian legislation. In fact, 31.2% of the brands assessed failed to satisfy the sodium reduction target decided upon for 2017. The italian salami was the product with the higher sodium content present a average value among the brands of 1716.11 mg 100 g-1. It became evident that merely implementing voluntary agreements had failed to provide total adequacy in the sodium content of the meat products. There is also great need for the industries to be more engaged in finding substitutes to minimize the sodium levels in the foods, without inducing significant alterations in the physicochemical, microbiological and technological features of the products, apart from the higher inspection by the government agencies in terms of agreement compliance and population awareness.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41692/29159,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Post-harvest physiology of pitaya at different ripening stages,"Red fleshed pitaya is an attractive fruit not due only to the color of its flesh and skin, but also the scaly shape of its skin. In addition to being a source of vitamins and minerals, it has high commercial value and represents an alternative for cultivation in semiarid regions. Information about the post-harvest physiology of pitaya, which interferes with its ripening, allows the adoption of preservation and quality-maintenance practices. This study examines the respiratory activity and post harvest alterations of pitaya picked in the commercially immature stage of ripeness, by comparing them with fruits picked fully ripe. Physical and chemical aspects of the fruits were evaluated in two harvests, in 2019 and 2020. Six days after harvest, there was an increase in respiratory activity and a change in color in both ripe and commercially immature fruits. Therefore, pitayas picked commercially immature in both harvests had an increase in respiratory activity post-harvest, with a change in skin color during storage; and six days after harvest, in the 2019 harvest, the fruits resembled those that ripened on the plant, without having their quality compromised. However, in the 2020 harvest, six days after harvest, the fruits picked fully ripe showed soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio, betacyanins and ascorbic acid contents similar to those measured in the commercially immature fruits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41264/29156,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Preconsolidation stress of gibbsitic and kaolinitic Oxisols under a multipractice conservationist coffee system,"Our goal was to analyze the impact of a multipractice soil conservationist system on coffee production in tropical soils (LATOSSOLO VERMELHO-AMARELO caulinítico/kaolinitic Haplustox and LATOSSOLO VERMELHO-gibbsítico/gibbsitic Acrustox soils) in Minas Gerais, Brazil. In the experimental area, the soil management involved a set of multiple conservationist practices during cultivation for more than 3.5 yrs. Soil samples were collected at 0-5, 10-15, and 20-25 cm depths at two positions: within planting rows and between rows. The soil physical and mechanical properties were determined, with a focus mainly on the preconsolidation stress model (preconsolidation stress versus matric tension). For the purpose of analysis, a split-split plot experimental design was implemented. A linear mixed regression (LMR) model was fitted, and Wald’s test was performed (P < 0.05). An improvement of soil physical quality for both Oxisols was observed at the planting row position. The effects of multipractice soil management after 3.5 yrs of cultivation in association with increased gibbsite content could promote new soil structure organization, as revealed by LMR, resulting in more resilient soils (between rows) and increasing the resistance to external pressures on gibbsitic Acrustox soils. Overall, the findings herein are in concordance with global trends towards conservationist practices that may alleviate soil compaction in agricultural systems to maintain environmental sustainability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41338/29157,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Ozonation of quinoa seeds (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.): saturation and decomposition kinetics of ozone and physiological quality of seeds,"Ozonation has been evaluated as an alternative method for seed treatment. In this context, the goal of this study was to evaluate the saturation process and kinetics of decomposition of ozone in a porous medium composed of quinoa BRS Syetetuba and possible changes in seed quality. Ozone concentration and saturation time in the porous medium and half-life were determined by adopting an inlet ozone concentration of 885 ppm and a flow rate of 5.0 L min-1 at 25 °C. The ozonation periods adopted were 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Regarding the physiological quality of the seeds, the germination percentage, germination speed index, electrical conductivity, and length of the shoot, root, and normal seedlings were analyzed. At the inlet ozone concentration of 885 ppm and a flow rate of 5.0 L min-1, the saturation concentration and saturation time in the porous medium composed of quinoa were 522.5 ppm and 12.0 min, respectively. The half-life of ozone in the porous medium was 6.08 min at 25 °C. Under these conditions, ozonation did not affect the physiological quality of quinoa BRS Syetetuba seeds for up to 120 min.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40762/29162,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Agronomic performance of ‘BRS Princesa’ banana under fertigation and mulching,"Banana is one of the most produced fruit crops in Brazil and has great economic, social and nutritional importance. Factors such as water availability and well-managed fertilization are fundamental to achieving profitable yields. The aim of this study was to examine the agronomic performance and water use efficiency of ‘BRS Princesa’ banana under combinations of irrigation systems, fertilization methods and mulching, during three production cycles. The experiment was laid out in a randomized-block design with four replicates. Treatments consisted of a combination of the localized irrigation system, fertilization strategy and mulching, as follows: Drip irrigation with manual fertilization; Micro-sprinkler irrigation with manual fertilization; Drip fertigation with mulch; Drip fertigation without mulch; Micro-sprinkler fertigation with mulch; and Micro-sprinkler fertigation without mulch. The plants were irrigated every three days, using three 4-L h-1 drippers per plant or a 64-L h-1 micro-sprinkler for every four plants. The following variables were analyzed: number of leaves, plant height, pseudostem circumference, number of hands, hand yield, water and nutrient (nitrogen and potassium) use efficiency and earliness. The micro-sprinkler system provided a greater pseudostem circumference without the presence of mulch. Plants under micro-sprinkler fertigation with mulching grew taller. The banana yield was higher when fertigation was used than with manual fertilization, regardless of the irrigation system. Plants grown in mulched soil were more productive than those grown in bare soil. The use of mulch increased water, nitrogen and potassium use efficiency when compared with cultivation in bare soil. Drip-irrigated plants showed earlier production than those irrigated with micro-sprinklers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40502/29153,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Upland rice seedling performance promoted by multifunctional microorganisms,"Multifunctional microorganisms can contribute to the development of plant root systems and positively affect the grain yield of crops. However, studies of the use of these microorganisms to benefit root development in rice plants are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of rhizobacterial inoculation of the seeds on the root development of upland rice seedlings. The experiment was carried out in the agricultural microbiology laboratory of Embrapa Rice and Beans, and we adopted a completely randomized design with eight replications. The treatments consisted of the inoculation of rice seeds with the rhizobacteria 1. Pseudomonas fluorescens (BRM 32111), 2. Burkholderia pyrrocinia (BRM 32113), 3. Serratia sp. (BRM 32114), 4. Bacillus sp. (1301), 5. Azospirillum brasilense (Ab-V5), 6. Azospirillum sp. (1381), and a 7. control treatment (without microorganisms). Treatment using the microorganism Azospirillum sp. (1381) provided the longest roots, greatest root volume and highest total dry mass of roots, at 86.34, 111.53 and 29.41%, respectively, significantly superior to the control treatment. In addition, treatments Ab-V5 and Bacillus sp. (1301) resulted in a root diameter of 13.81 and 13.06%, respectively, larger than that of the control treatment. The use of these multifunctional microorganisms was efficient for promoting the root development of rice seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39759/28522,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Potassium nitrate to overcome dormancy of Urochloa humidicola Comum seeds,"The main difficulty with propagating Urochloa humidicola Comum is the high percentage of seed dormancy. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a treatment to overcome seed dormancy and promote seed germination of this species that can be applied at a large scale. This study was conducted in two stages. First, the following treatments were evaluated using one seed lot: control (without treatment), immersion in H2SO4 (98%, 36N) for 10 min, moistening the germination substrate with KNO3 (0.2%) and immersion in KNO3 at concentrations of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% for periods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, followed by drying in the shade. In the second stage, three seed lots were evaluated in all of the aforementioned treatments, except for those of immersion in 0% KNO3 and of all concentrations for 36 and 48 h. The seeds were evaluated for water content, germination, percentage of abnormal seedlings, dead and dormant seeds, first count, and average germination time. Immersion in the KNO3 solution was efficient in overcoming dormancy and promoting germination. To be used by companies, the immersion of seeds in a 4% KNO3 solution for 24 h was the most suitable treatment to overcome dormancy and promote the germination of U. humidicola Comum seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40397/29152,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Cell damage, gas exchange, and growth of Annona squamosa L. under saline water irrigation and potassium fertilization","The semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil has water limitations in terms of both quantity and quality, with salt stress as a limiting factor for increasing yield in most crops. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate cell damage, gas exchange, and growth of custard apple under salt stress and potassium fertilization. The research was carried out at the Experimental Farm of CCTA/UFCG, in São Domingos-PB, Brazil. A randomized block design was arranged in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme, with two levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw; 1.3 and 4.0 dS m-1) and five potassium doses (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 g of K2O per plant per year). Water salinity of 4.0 dS m-1 negatively affected the stem diameter and number of leaves in custard apple at 179 and 210 days after transplanting (DAT). The highest relative growth in stem diameter in the period of 179-245 DAT was obtained in plants irrigated with 4.0 dS m-1 water and fertilized with 20 g of K2O per plant. Potassium doses of up to 30 g of K2O resulted in a higher percentage of cell damage and relative water content in custard apple leaf tissue. Water saturation deficit decreased with the increase in K2O doses in plants irrigated with water of 1.3 dS m-1. Irrigation with 1.3 dS m-1 water and estimated K2O doses ranging from 16 to 22 g per plant resulted in an increase in stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency in custard apple plants at 210 DAT.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40742/29154,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Characterization of physiological maturity of Physalis peruviana L. fruits,"Physalis peruviana L. has great nutritional value and economic viability, representing an innovation for Brazilian horticulture. However, knowing the ideal point of harvesting fruits of this species is a key factor in this process that allows maximum post-harvest utilization, providing better quality and minimal losses when the fruit is harvested at physiological maturity. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize the physiological maturity of Physalis peruviana L. fruits. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design in which the treatmentscorresponded to different stages of fruit and seed maturation (20, 27, 34, and 41 days after anthesis [DAA]), with four replicates. The analyzed variables consisted of colorimetry (lightness, chroma and hue angle) of calyx and fruit; fresh weight, diameter (transverse and longitudinal), firmness, pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total soluble solids:titratable acidity ratio, vitamin C and phenolic compounds of fruits; and carotenoids and chlorophyll (a and b) of calyx.

42,2021,Enzymatic activity in azuki bean seedlings subjected to salinity and water deficiency,"Salinity and water deficiency are factors that limit the initial development of crops, directly interfering with the efficiency of food production. Studies on the behavior of cultivable species under stress are important to determine management actions; therefore, the mechanisms involved in post-stress recovery should be investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of water and salt stress on enzymatic activity in azuki bean seedlings. The experimental design was a completely randomized, 4 × 6 factorial arrangement (four reagents: CaCl2, KCl, NaCl, and polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) × six osmotic potentials: 0.0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 MPa). The quantification of protein content and analysis of enzyme (catalase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) activity in seedlings were performed on the 10th day after sowing. NaCl is toxic and recovery of azuki bean seedlings was less likely under salt stress owing to reduced enzymatic activity. In contrast, seedlings subjected to KCl treatment showed increased production of antioxidant enzymes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38048/28520,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Controlled deterioration test to evaluate the physiological potential of sweet corn seeds,"The evaluation of the physiological potential of sweet corn seeds is essential in a quality control program and the choice of vigor tests using an adequate analysis methodology is essential to obtain reliable results. In this sense, this study aimed to standardize the methodology of the controlled deterioration test through combinations between time and temperature to evaluate the vigor of sweet corn seeds. Six lots of sweet corn seeds were characterized by the degree of moisture and the initial physiological potential through the following tests: germination, first germination count, cold test, electrical conductivity, accelerated aging, length and dry mass of normal seedlings, seedling emergence in sand, and emergence rate index. Subsequently, these lots had their initial water content adjusted to 20% using the wet substrate method. The seeds from the six lots were subjected to the controlled deterioration test under two temperatures for four periods, obtaining a completely randomized design in an 8 × 6 factorial scheme with eight combinations of time/temperature and six lots. Germination and the first germination count were evaluated after the deterioration test. The data were subjected to analysis of variance with a comparison of means by the Tukey test at a 5% significance. The results of the first count and germination tests after deterioration were subjected to a simple linear correlation study together with the initial characterization data. The combinations 8 h – 40 °C and 8 h – 45 °C in the controlled deterioration test were efficient in distinguishing the vigor of seed lots. The shorter exposure period and the first germination count after deterioration are more suitable for evaluating the vigor of sweet corn seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40207/29184,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Physiological potential of corn seeds treated with different dosages of molybdenum and potassium,"Corn is important in agriculture for its dual is uses as food and animal feed. The use of quality seeds is fundamental for outcomes in the field. The treatment of seeds with molybdenum may increase the productive capacity and uniformity of the corn. For this to work, the amount applied to the seeds must be adequate to promote development and increase the final crop production. Thus, the objective of this work was to verify the effects of molybdenum and potassium application on the germination and vigor of corn seeds. The physiological quality of the seeds was evaluated by germination, first count, seedling length (shoot and root), seedling dry matter mass, emergence, and the cold test. Six treatments (T1–T6) were performed, with T1 free of molybdenum and potassium and the others with varying dosages. The seeds were treated with a commercial product that containing molybdenum and potassium. The design was completely randomized, with four replications and six treatments. Smaller doses of molybdenum resulted in a higher percentage of normal seedlings. Based on the length and dry mass of the seedlings, it was verified that maize seeds were negatively impacted by increasing doses of molybdenum and potassium. In the emergence tests in sand, treatments T5 and T6 presented a greater number of seedlings. The physiological quality of corn seeds was not significantly influenced by the application of molybdenum and potassium in the first count and germination results in the cold and germination tests.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37390/28519,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design used was randomized blocks, with three treatments: corn silage without inoculant (control); corn silage with 11CFT inoculant (consisting of strains of Lactobacillus buchneri and L. casei); and corn silage with 11C33 inoculant (consisting of strains of L. buchneri, L. plantarum and Enterococcus faecium). The use of both inoculants increased the concentration of lactic acid in the silage (22.42 g kg-1 for control against 36.00 and 33.33 g kg-1 for 11CFT and 11C33, respectively) and reduced aerobic dry matter losses. The silage treated with 11C33 obtained a higher concentration of acetic acid (17.44 g kg-1) and propionic acid (2.08 g kg-1). The 11CFT inoculant provided a lower concentration of ethanol, however, without differing from the silage with 11C33 (0.70 and 1.61 g kg-1, respectively). Even without variations in temperature and pH at silage unloading, the use of the 11C33 inoculant generated a higher concentration of acetic and propionic acid, providing better aerobic stability days after unloading. Both inoculants also improved the in situ ruminal digestibility of corn silage compared to control silage. They provide an increase in the content of lactic and propionic acids, which assist to reduce dry matter losses and ethanol production. There were no variations in temperature and pH at the silo unloading, however, the use of the 11C33 inoculant generated a higher concentration of acetic and propionic acids providing better aerobic stability after exposure to air.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40645/28518,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Economic viability of a canadian biodigester for power generation in dairy farming,"This study aimed to analyze the economic viability of implementing and using a Canadian biodigester for power generation in a milk production system. Specifically, we intended to estimate the generated power production, the total production cost (TC), the total operating cost (TOC), and the effective operating cost (EOC) of 1 kW of power generated, and estimate the break-even point of the power produced. The research was carried out on a farm located in southern Minas Gerais (Brazil) from January to December 2017. Three scenarios were analyzed through the tree-point estimation (most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic). Scenario 1 considered the use of power for the acclimatization of free-stall barns during 13 hours day-1 plus the use of 50% of the produced biofertilizer. Scenario 2 considered the use of power during 13 hours day-1 for the acclimatization of free-stall barns and milking parlor, which means an increase in power consumption estimated at 10% compared to scenario 1, plus the use of 75% of the produced biofertilizer. Moreover, scenario 3 considered the use of power for the acclimatization of free-stall barns during 6.5 hours day-1 plus 25% of the produced biofertilizer. All scenarios considered the amount charged per kWh by the Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CEMIG). Monte Carlo simulations were carried out with minimum acceptable rates of return ranging from zero to 50%. Power generation was economically viable in all scenarios, with positive net present value (NPV), internal rates of return above the minimum acceptable rate of return, simple and discounted payback below the 10-year horizon, and satisfactory benefit-cost ratios. The EOC values of 1 kWh of power were estimated at R$ 0.1990, R$ 0.1791, and R$ 0.3308 for scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively, whereas the mean total cost (TC) was R$ 0.5618 (±0.21) considering all scenarios, above the purchase values at CEMIG, which would be R$ 0.50. The TC value was R$ 99,804.42 for scenarios 1 and 2, and R$ 92,424.09 for scenario 3, with a minimum acceptable rate of return of 8.50, while the TOC values were R$ 69,486.62 in scenarios 1 and 2, and R$ 62,229.66 in scenario 3. The amount of power generated in all scenarios was higher than the break-even point. All Monte Carlo simulation models showed positive NPV values, indicating that there is a high probability of being above expectations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40592/28517,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Economic viability of implementing an infrastructure for recycling bedding sand from a free-stall facility for dairy cows,"This study proposes to examine the economic viability of implementing the necessary infrastructure for the recycling of bedding sand from a free-stall facility in a milk production system in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. In specific terms, the total production cost (TC), total operating cost (TOC) and effective operating cost (EOC) of a cubic meter of recycled sand were estimated in order to estimate the total sand consumption for the free-stall system and per bed year-1 as well as the equilibrium point of the amount of recycled sand, in cubic meters. The experiment was carried out on a farm located in the south of Minas Gerais from January 2016 to December 2017. Three scenarios were analyzed by the tree-point estimation method (MOP - most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic). Utilization of 85%, 95% and 75% of the recycled sand was considered for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In all of them, the value charged per cubic meter of sand by a supplier close to the farm was considered. Monte Carlo simulation was also carried out with hurdle rates (HR) of up to 90%. Under the studied conditions, sand recycling showed to be economically viable in all scenarios, with positive net present values (NPV), internal rates of return above the HR, simple and discounted payback below the 10-year horizon, and satisfactory cost benefit-1 ratios (greater than 1). The EOC of one cubic meter of recycled sand was estimated at R$5.04, R$4.51 and R$5.72 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas the average TC, considering all scenarios, was R$6.84 (+0.81), which is less than the acquisition price of R$28.57 at the sand extraction site. The TC was R$37,219.51 and R$34,637.74 for the scenarios with HR of 8.50 and 6.99%, respectively, whereas TOC was R$22,572.08 in all analyzed scenarios. The estimated total annual sand consumption by the free-stall system was 526.44 m³, with an estimated average of 1.23 m³ (+0.28) bed-1 year-1. All Monte Carlo simulation models showed positive NPV as well as HR of up to 90%, which reflect a high probability of positive NPV.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40433/28516,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Effect of glyphosate drift on marandu grass,"Glyphosate drift in plants that are not resistant to the herbicide molecule can result in stimulation to certain biological features, characterizing the phenomenon of hormesis. On this basis, productive and chemical traits were evaluated in marandu grass, in a simulation of the drift effect, using sublethal doses of the herbicide glyphosate. The experiment was in laid out in a randomized-block design with split plots in time, in four replicates. The effect of sublethal doses of glyphosate acid equivalent (a.e.) (21.60, 43.20, 64.80, 86.40 and 108.00 g ha-1) and control was evaluated in the plots; and the effect of harvesting at 92, 113, 134 and 155 days after sowing (DAS) the grass was evaluated in the subplots. The Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu was collected at a height of 0.20 m, at a defoliation interval of 21 days, to estimate production and chemical traits, in experimental plots with a usable area of 7.5 m2. Leaf: stem ratio was influenced by the interaction between the evaluated factors (dose and harvest). Dose fitted a second-order polynomial model, with a hormesis effect of 21.60 to 76.50 g ha-1 of glyphosate a.e. Harvesting at 134 DAS differed significantly from 92 DAS. The forage yield showed a linear response inversely proportional to the increasing glyphosate doses. There was a polynomial increase in leaf phosphorus content, characterizing hormesis up to the sublethal dose of 72.50 g a.e. ha-1. Harvest influenced the neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin and leaf phosphorus contents.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40036/28515,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Relative weight and length of digestive tract and intestinal histomorphometric measurements of slow-growing broilers of different genotypes,"An experiment was conducted to investigate the development of the digestive system in slow-growing broilers of different strains. The experiment involved a total of 544 one-day-old chicks, 136 of each of four genotypes, namely, Label Rouge Pesadão, Label Rouge Pescoço Pelado, Carijó and Carijó Pescoço Pelado. The birds were distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments (genotypes) and eight replicates of 17 animals each. Live weight, digestive tract development and intestinal histomorphometric measurements were evaluated at different ages. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the strains for live weight, relative weight and length of digestive tract organs and intestinal histomorphometric measurements at one, seven and 28 days of age. The Carijó strain showed greater weight and development of digestive organs than the Carijó Pescoço Pelado strain. There was a difference (p < 0.05) for histomorphometric measurements of the small intestine between the strains at the evaluated ages. The Carijó Pescoço Pelado and Label Rouge Pescoço Pelado strains showed higher villi and higher villus:crypt ratios in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.

42,2021,Docosahexaenoic acid associated vitamin E in the diluent for cryopreservation of goat semen,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of and determine the optimum level of inclusion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the diluent for goat semen cryopreservation. Five Boer males underwent semen collection, totaling 10 viable collections per animal. After evaluation, the ejaculates were pooled and fractionated in Tris-yolk medium with the addition of 0; 30; 45; or 60ng mL-1 of DHA and 0.4 mmol of alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E). The semen was cryopreserved in a freezing machine (TK 3000TM) and placed in a cryogenic cylinder for subsequent analysis. Data were evaluated by regression analysis at 5% significance. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in sperm kinetic parameters evaluated by computer assisted sperm analysis: total motility (79.17 ± 17.31%), progressive motility (14.04 ± 5.73%), curvilinear speed (58.82 ± 6.35µm/s), progressive linear speed (22.49 ± 3.63µm/s), mean path speed (35.17 ± 4.52µm/s), linearity (38.69 ± 5.79%), rectilinearity (63.99 ± 6.64%), and oscillation index (59.68 ± 2.99%). There were no differences (P > 0.05) found from the membrane functional integrity test for reactive spermatozoa (69.66 ± 9.76%), plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity of intact spermatozoa (29.86 ± 7.57%), mitochondrial potential of Class I cryopreserved goat semen (72.75 ± 9.81%), and chromatin compaction of intact chromatin (96.87 ± 4.37%). Thus, the inclusion of up to 60ng mL-1 of DHA did not promote any improvement in the seminal quality parameters of post-thawed goat semen.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40223/28508,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,The effects of tryptophan and pyridoxine supplied orally to nursing piglets on weight loss and social behavior after weaning,"This study evaluated the effect of oral supplementation with tryptophan (Trp) and pyridoxine (Pyr) on the growth performance and social behavior of suckling piglets before and after weaning. At day 14, six suckling piglets per sow were distributed into three treatments and allotted in a randomized block design, with eight replicates and two piglets per experimental unit. Treatments consisted of a Control - oral supplementation with L-alanine (1.70 g), D-glucose (1.74 g) and distilled water (3.44 mL); Trp - oral supplementation with Trp (3.5 g/d) and distilled water; and Trp + Pyr - oral supplementation with Trp (3.5 g/d) + Pyr (0.0095 g/d) and distilled water. Each treatment was supplied orally five times per day (2.5 mL each treatment), from 14 to 21 days old. Piglets were monitored continuously in the nursing phase for 24 h at 21, 28 and 33 days of age to assess the behavior (standing, lying, eating, socializing, sitting and drinking). Piglets receiving oral Trp + Pyr showed a decreased weight loss on the first day after weaning (P = 0.03). Performance was not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments in each studied period, such as in overall period (21 to 34 days) after weaning. Piglets receiving Trp supplementation visited the feeders more frequently from days 21 to 22 (P < 0.01) and from days 28 to 29 (P < 0.02), as well as in the overall period (P < 0.01). It is concluded that high doses of tryptophan with or without high doses of pyridoxine, supplied orally to nursing piglets, reduced the weight loss on the first day after weaning and increased the frequency of visits to the drinkers on the first day after weaning and also to the feeders, mainly from weaning until 7 days after.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39989/28514,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Effect of advancing maturity stages of corn for silage on chemical characterization, digestibility and production costs","The goal of the present study was to evaluate the biomass and grain yield, the morphological and chemical composition, production costs and the ruminal disappearance of the whole corn plant and grain-free corn plant harvested at different reproductive stages. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of six treatments, where each treatment corresponded to a stage of corn maturity. The advance of plant cycle promoted an increase in dry biomass and grain yields per unit area, reducing production costs. Higher participation of grains and lower participation of structural components promoted a reduction in NDF and ADF, with the lowest values in dough grain (R4) and dent grain (R5) stages. The advancement of stages promoted an increase in production and a reduction in costs, but significantly reduced the quality of grain-free plants, increasing the NDF, ADF and ADL; but R4 and R5 presented NDFd of 84.80 % and 82.79 %, respectively, showing to be a good quality fiber. R4 stage had the highest rumen disappearance values after 24 and 48 hours of incubation. Based on chemical data, ruminal disappearance, ruminal degradation kinetics of the whole corn plant and without grains, the R4 stage of the evaluated hybrid is the stage at which the plant had the best quality, representing the appropriate stage to harvest the material for making silage, aiming at the production of a silage with good chemical quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39554/28510,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Antimicrobial effect of bothropstoxin-i in broilers,"Bacterial resistance is a sanitary issue explained by indiscriminate use of nonprescription drugs, and antimicrobial use in food production for growth promotion. Bothropstoxin-I (BthTx-I) is a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from Bothrops jararacussu venom, which has a known antimicrobial effect. The goal of this study was the unprecedented evaluation of in vivo antimicrobial activity of BthTx-I in broilers. Microbiological, biochemical, and histological parameters were determined using 84 21-day old broilers that were kept in cages with four birds each at a density of 625 cm2/broiler. The experiment was randomized by three treatments with seven repetitions of four broilers each that lasted seven days. The treatments were: 1) bacitracin zinc diet; 2) PLA2-BthTx-I; 3) without additives. The data obtained from the studied variables was subjected to analysis of variance and an F-test at the 5% significance level. Averages of each variable in each treatment were compared by Tukey’s test. Broiler bacterial cloacal counts showed that BthTx-I decreased the microbial population without reducing body weight, intestinal morphology, or liver or kidney histopathological damage. The toxin showed in vivo activity, being an alternative for better performance in the production of broiler chickens, because it acted by decreasing the microbial load of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of the birds and did not cause muscle, liver or kidney damage at the assessed dosage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40248/28509,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,Morphophysiology of tropical grasses under different water supply in two growing seasons: II. BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses,"This study aimed to evaluate the physiological parameters and the biomass flow and structural characteristics of BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses under different irrigation conditions. The rating of gas exchange, biomass flow and structural characteristics were performed in dry periods and dry/rainy season, under the water supply of 30; 60; 90 and 120% of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement 4x2 (water supply and grass). The experiment was conducted in pots with capacity for 7.5 dm³, using as substrate layer of 0-0.2 m soil. There was no effect (P < 0.05) between the gas exchange in the dry period, having the largest growing parameters of irrigation schemes. In the transition period of dry/rainy, we observed a reversal behavior in relation to the dry period, showing a rapid recovery of grasses under the minor water supply. It was observed quadratic behavior to concentrations of CO2 in the leaf mesophilic (Ci) with maximum point to the BRS Massai grass and minimum point to the BRS Tamani grass, where the major and minor Ci were 119 and 48 ppm in the water supply of 107 and 35% of ETo, respectively. In relation to the biomass flow, the BRS Tamani grass presented greater stem elongation rate and leaf senescence rate in relation to BRS Massai in both periods assessed. In the dry period, we observed a higher biomass production of green leaf blades in the BRS Tamani grass, while in the transition dry/rainy season, the results for this variable were similar, and at the same time that observed higher accumulation of green culm biomass to the BRS Tamani grass, which certainly affected its structure. It is concluded that the application of a minimum daily water supply of 30% of ETo allows the maintenance of BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses without incurring the death of tillers and reduction of regrowth vigor, whereas the water supply of 90% of ETo favors the morphophysiological characteristics, especially of BRS Tamani grass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39800/28512,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Hematologic response and serum and peritoneal fluid proteinogram of cattle affected by intestinal diseases and traumatic reticuloperitonitis,"This study aimed to evaluate the hematologic response and the serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) proteinogram of cattle affected by digestive diseases. Twenty-seven animals were distributed in two groups: GI (intestinal diseases) and GII (traumatic reticuloperitonitis, TRP). The animals were previously submitted to a physical exam. Subsequently, blood samples were collected to perform the complete blood count, determine the plasma protein and fibrinogen, and obtain the serum for proteinogram in polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Simultaneously, PF was collected to perform physical and chemical evaluation and the electrophoretic profile (SDS-PAGE). ANOVA at the 5% probability level was used to compare the groups. The animals showed signs of apathy, dehydration, and gastrointestinal hypomotility in both groups. However, GI animals showed more significant clinical changes. The blood count of both groups (P > 0.05) showed leukocytosis due to neutrophilia and a regenerative left shift with hyperfibrinogenemia. The proteinogram of both body fluids allowed the identification of proteins albumin (ALB), transferrin (TRF), ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, ?1-acid glycoprotein (?1-AGP), MW 23000 Da, ?1-antitrypsin, IgA, and IgG. The [PT] PF/[PT] blood serum ratio of each of the identified proteins increased, showing statistical differences between groups (P < 0.05) regarding PT, ALB, TRF, ?1-AGP, and IgG values, with GI animals showing the highest ratio. Intestinal diseases and TRP triggered a systemic and local response characterized by clinical, hematological, and serum and PF proteinogram alterations. The proteins ?1-GPA, haptoglobin, and TRF measured in PF were good inflammation biomarkers and useful as an auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of digestive diseases in cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39887/28505,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Prostaglandin F2? as ovulatory stimulus in dairy cows and buffaloes raised in the Amazon biome,"This study evaluated the effect of a prostaglandin F2? (PGF) analogue as an ovulatory stimulus in dairy cows and buffaloes raised in the Amazon biome. To this end, three experiments were performed in the state of Rondônia, located in the Amazon biome. In Experiment 1, 22 lactating dairy buffaloes received 2 mg of intramuscular (I.M.) estradiol benzoate (EB) on day 0 and an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device (CIDR) from day 0 to day 9 of the protocol. On days 8 and 9, all cows were given 500 ?g of I.M. d-cloprostenol (PGF analogue). On day 10, buffaloes were divided into two groups to receive 500 ?g of PGF (PGF group, n = 8) or no treatment (CTL group, n = 14), respectively. In Experiment 2, 16 lactating crossbred dairy cows (Holstein x Gir) received 2 mg of EB on day 0 and a CIDR insert from day 0 to day 8. On days 7 and 8, all cows were given 500 ?g of d-cloprostenol. On day 9, cows were divided into two groups to receive 500 ?g of d-cloprostenol (PGF group, n = 8) or no treatment (CTL group, n = 8), respectively. In Experiment 3, 16 lactating crossbred dairy cows (Holstein x Gir) were handled and treated similarly as in Experiment 2, although cows did not receive d-cloprostenol on day 8. Single-point outcome variables were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while proportions with dichotomous outcomes were analyzed with the chi-square test. In Experiment 1, there was no difference (P = 0.30) in the ovulation rate between groups, and, on average, 68% of the buffaloes ovulated. Moreover, the treatment did not affect the interval to ovulation (P = 0.61) nor the diameter of the preovulatory follicle (P = 0.47). As for Experiment 2, only one cow, from the PG group, did not ovulate. There were no differences between the CTL and PG groups (P = 0.69) in the moment of ovulation, which occurred in average 82 h after CIDR removal. Finally, in Experiment 3, cows treated with PGF ovulated earlier than those in the CTL group (62.5 ± 5.8 and 94.5 ± 13.5 h, respectively; P = 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PGF hastens ovulation in lactating dairy cows, whereas no effect was observed in dairy buffaloes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39633/28503,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"Antibiotic resistance profile of gram-negative bacteria isolated from dog nasal swab samples, and antibacterial and antioxidant activities of aqueous extracts of Alpinia purpurta (Vieill.) K. Schum (Zingiberaceae)","The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and their negligent use among dog owners have contributed to the rise of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms found in pets. In addition, the search for medicinal plants with antibacterial properties has made the evaluation of aqueous extracts of Alpinia purpurata (Vieill.) K. Schum an important issue. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine the antibiotic resistance profile of gram-negative bacteria isolated from nasal swab samples of dogs and assess the antibacterial activity of the aqueous extracts of leaves and rhizomes of A. purpurata. The bacteria identified were tested using the agar disc diffusion assay for the evaluation of antibiotic resistance. A total of 16 isolates were obtained from the 19 samples collected, with a high prevalence of Escherichia coli (n=5). There was a high rate of resistance to ?-lactams, where the highest percentage was seen for amoxicillin (72.5%). Aqueous leaf extracts had high levels of total phenolic compounds (637.47 µg GAE mg-1), differing significantly (p < 0.05) from aqueous rhizome extracts (228.64 µg GAE mg-1). There was no significant difference in EC50 of DPPH values between the aqueous extracts; however, the antioxidant capacity of rhizome extracts had higher values than leaf extracts. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of leaves and rhizomes for the evaluated bacteria ranged from 9000 to 32,000 µg mL-1. For the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), most bacteria showed an MBC over 38,400 µg mL-1 for the rhizome. In conclusion, the bacteria isolated from dog nasal swabs showed a high resistance profile for the antibiotics of the penicillin class. Additionally, the results from the analysis of the aqueous extracts of rhizomes and leaves of A. purpurata showed an antimicrobial effect possibly associated with a high content of total phenolic compounds; these results can create a scope for using these extracts together with conventional antibiotics to control the emergence of antibiotic resistance among microbial species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39504/28502,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Effect of the application of probiotic strains of Enterococcus faecium on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of coalho cheese,"Coalho cheese is a typical Northeastern Brazilian food whose production and consumption has expanded considerably to other regions of the country. Despite its cultural and socioeconomic relevance, coalho cheese still has a negative reputation due to problems in its physicochemical and microbiological quality standards, especially when it is produced artisanally. For this reason, many researchers have been looking for alternatives to improve the quality and the notoriety of this product, such as the application of probiotic strains to inhibit pathogens. However, in addition to the research related to the desired probiotic properties and the safety of strains for food application, it is important to know the possible changes in the food matrix caused by this intervention. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the incorporation of probiotic strains of Enterococcus faecium on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of coalho cheese. The cheeses were made with pasteurized cow milk and probiotic strains of E. faecium were added during production. Cheeses were also made without adding the strains, and considered as control cheeses. The final products were evaluated for moisture, pH, titratable acidity, total carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, ash, color, organic acid profile, and sensory attributes. In addition, viable lactic acid bacteria were also assessed. Coalho cheeses containing E. faecium showed higher titratable acidity and lower pH. In addition, there was a reduction in the carbohydrate content, which was attributed to lactose degradation. The organic acid profile also varied, as highlighted by the increase in the concentration of lactic acid by a factor of 3.5, and by the absence of citric acid as a possible result of the metabolism of E. faecium in the production of aromatic compounds. There was no variation in the color or sensory acceptance of the cheeses.

The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, in Pombal-PB, Brazil, using a randomized block design in a 5 ? 2 factorial arrangement, with five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7, and 3.5 dS m-1) and two passion fruit cultivars (BRS Sol do Cerrado and Guinezinho), with three plants per plot and four replicates. The reduction in transpiration, intercellular CO2 concentration and CO2 assimilation rate in passion fruit plants grown with saline water was related to factors of stomatal and non-stomatal origin. Gas exchange and growth of passion fruit cultivars were negatively affected by water salinity from 0.3 dS m-1 at 75 days after sowing. Despite the reduction in the growth of the passion fruit cultivars, irrigation with water of up to 3.5 dS m-1 could be used to obtain seedlings with acceptable quality. Based on the relative yield of total dry phytomass, the passion fruit cultivars BRS Sol do Cerrado and Guinezinho were classified as moderately sensitive to water salinity during the seedling phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40413/28499,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Influence of dry and wet beef maturation on the microbiological quality and safety,"The most used methods for the maturation process are vacuum (wet-aged) and dry (dry-aged), which can influence the microbiological quality and safety of meat for consumption. In this study, we aimed to verify the differences in microbiological quality between beef (Longissimus dorsi) that was wet-aged and dry-aged for 30 days, by quantification of indicator microorganism groups and molecular identification of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. This study verified that the meat matured by the dry-aged method showed significantly lower counts of total coliforms, aerobic mesophiles, psychrotrophs, and molds and yeasts as compared to wet-aged meat. While the Salmonella spp. was not isolated in any beef sample, L. monocytogenes and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were isolated only from wet-aged beef. Thus, it was concluded that the superficial dehydration of the meat during dry-aged maturation, if carried out correctly and hygienically, confers higher microbiological quality and can reduce the occurrence of microbiological hazards.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40225/28500,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This study aimed to verify the magnitude of the stocking rate and shoot and root dry matter of palisade grass at the end of the fifth cattle grazing period of an experiment in the CLI system on the visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS), soil-water infiltration rate, and basic infiltration rate (BIR) as a function of grazing heights on Urochloa brizantha cv. MG 5 Vitória in the northwestern Paraná State, Brazil. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with three replications and 1-ha experimental plots on an Oxisol. Four treatments with grazing heights of 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm were used in the CLI system, controlled with variable stocking rates of Purunã cattle in the autumn/winter season on Urochloa brizantha cv. MG 5 Vitória in succession to soybean in the summer. The maximum soil water infiltration was stabilized at 30 cm of grazing height of the palisade grass under continuous grazing in the CLI system. The increase in the stocking rate decreased the shoot dry matter of palisade grass, soil water infiltration, and structural soil quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40213/28498,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Chloroplast pigments and photochemical efficiency of West Indian cherry under salt stress and potassium-phosphorus fertilization,"The objective of this study was to evaluate chloroplast pigments and photochemical efficiency of West Indian cherry cv. BRS 366 Jaburu as a function of irrigation water salinity and potassium-phosphorus fertilization combinations in the second year of cultivation. The experiment was carried out in a protected environment in Campina Grande, Brazil. Treatments were distributed in randomized blocks, in a 5 × 4 factorial scheme, corresponding to five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water ECw (0.6, 1.4, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.8 dS m-1) and four combinations of potassium-phosphorus fertilization (100/100, 85/85, 60/60 and 45/45% of the K2O/P2O5 recommendation for the second year of cultivation 200 g of K2O and 120 g of P2O5 per plant per year) with three replicates. Irrigation with saline waters hampered the biosynthesis of chloroplast pigments and the photochemical efficiency of West Indian cherry cv. BRS 366 Jaburu in the second year of cultivation. Water salinity from 2.6 dS m-1 reduced the maximum fluorescence, variable fluorescence, and quantum efficiency of photosystem II of West Indian cherry plants cv. BRS 366 Jaburu. Fertilization with 60/60 and 85/85% of the K2O/P2O5 recommendation promotes an increase in the synthesis of chlorophylls a and b, respectively, in the first and second production cycles of the second year of cultivation. Supply of 85/85% of the K2O/P2O5 recommendation promoted an increase in maximum and variable fluorescence in plants subjected to water salinities of 0.6, 2.2, and 3.8 dS m-1 in the second cycle and reduced the initial fluorescence, regardless of the salinity level in the first and second production cycles of West Indian cherry.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39947/28496,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Sowing dates and node emission in buckwheat cultivars,"The aim of this study was to determine the rate of node appearance (RNA), the final number of nodes (FNN) and the period of node emission (PNE) in two buckwheat cultivars (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) for different sowing dates, and to check variability in the RNA, FNN and PNE between the cultivars and sowing dates. The IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars were evaluated for 29 and 31 sowing dates from October to May in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 agricultural years respectively. In each experiment, a completely randomised design with five replications was used. The number of nodes (NN) on the main stem was counted twice a week in each plant (replication), from emission of the first node until the end of the cycle. The linear regression (y = a + bx) of the number of nodes (NN, y) was adjusted for each plant based on the number of days after emergence (DAE, x). The rate of node appearance (RNA), in days node-1, was determined from the inverse of the slope of the linear regression between NN and DAE (RNA = 1/b). The RNA was calculated for the period of node emission (PNE, in days), i.e. from emergence to emission of the last node. The final number of nodes (FNN) was counted at the end of node emission. Variability was found in the rate of node appearance (RNA), the final number of nodes (FNN) and the period of node emission (PNE) between the cultivars and sowing dates. The rate of node appearance ranges between 2.20 and 8.23 days node-1, the final number of nodes between 2.20 and 17.20, and the period of node emission between 16.60 and 49.20 days. Plants of the IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars show better vegetative development (lower RNA, higher FNN and greater PNE) when sown in November, December, January and February, compared to those sown in October, March, April and May.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39778/28564,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Chickpea seed vigor evaluated by computerized seedling analysis,"Computerized seedling analysis is a promising tool for assessing seed vigor, providing reliable and less subjective results. The aim of this study was to define a method for evaluating the vigor of chickpea seeds through computerized image analysis, using the Seedling Analysis System (Sistema de Análise de Plântula - SAPL®) as a basis. Two chickpea cultivars were evaluated, consisting of five seed lots of cv. BRS Aleppo and four seed lots of cv. Cícero. Test were performed on the seeds of each cultivar for initial characterization of the physiological potential of the lots, and the results were compared with the determinations made via SAPL®. The results showed high correlations between the variables obtained from computerized analysis and from traditional vigor tests, especially for the close relationship between the cold test and low temperature germination test with the corrected vigor index (r > 0.9) evaluated on the fourth day after the beginning of the test. The total length of seedlings, length of the primary root, and growth and corrected vigor indices obtained through computerized analysis of seedlings on the 4th day after sowing allowed separation of the lots regarding vigor. Computerized analysis of seedlings using SAPL® is effective in determining the vigor of chickpea seed lots.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39315/28495,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,"The no-tillage, with crop rotation or succession, can increase the degree of clay dispersion in the superficial layer of highly weathered soils after 24 years","Clay dispersion is directly related to water erosion, especially during detaching and dragging of particles. No-till is one of the most important strategies for soil and water conservation in tropical and sub-tropical regions, and when associated with crop rotation, may reduce the degree of clay dispersion. The study aimed to evaluate, after 24 years, the effect of different soil management systems and crop systems on the degree of clay dispersion of a Rhodic Ferralsol. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 4x2 factorial scheme, with four soil managements (continuous no-tillage, no-tillage with chiseling every three years, disk plowing followed by light harrowing and heavy disking followed by light harrowing) and with two crop systems (crop succession and rotation). The degree of clay dispersion was evaluated and associated with soil chemical attributes from layer 0.00-0.10 m. The degree of clay dispersion is affected by the soil management systems with no effect of crop systems. The soil management system with the lowest soil disturbance (continuous no-tillage) has a higher degree of clay dispersion than the ones that disturb the soil, regardless of the agricultural implement used or soil disturbance intensity. The soil electrochemical imbalance, primarily caused by soil potential acidity, is positively correlated to the increase in the degree of clay dispersion of the superficial soil layer under continuum no-tillage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39300/28586,E-ISSN 1679-0359
42,2021,Co-inoculation and inoculation methods of plant growth-promoting bacteria in wheat yield performance,"Em trigo, embora diversos estudos já tenham sido relatados sobre os efeitos benéficos da inoculação de Azospirillum brasilense, são escassos na literatura trabalhos relacionados ao uso de coinoculação de A. brasilense e Rhizobium sp., bem como a avaliação de diferentes métodos de inoculação. Os objetivos do estudo foram: i) verificar a eficiência de bactérias promotoras do crescimento de plantas (BPCP) em ambientes subtropicais; ii) verificar a eficiência da coinoculação de A. brasilense e Rhizobium sp.; e iii) verificar a eficiência do manejo de diferentes métodos de inoculação na cultura do trigo. Os experimentos foram conduzidos nos municípios de Londrina e Apucarana, Paraná, sob o delineamento experimental de blocos completos ao acaso, com quatro repetições e nove tratamentos: T1) ausência de nitrogênio (N) em cobertura; T2) 30 kg ha-1 de N em cobertura; T3) 60 kg ha-1 de N em cobertura; T4) A. brasilense Ab-V5 nas sementes; T5) A. brasilense Ab-V5 em pós-emergência; T6) A. brasilense Ab-V5 + Rhizobium sp. 53GRM1 nas sementes; T7) A. brasilense Ab-V5 + Rhizobium sp. 53GRM1 em pós-emergência; T8) Inoculante comercial (A. brasilense Ab-V5 + Ab-V6) nas sementes; e T9) Inoculante comercial (A. brasilense Ab-V5 + Ab-V6) em pós-emergência. Foram avaliadas as seguintes características: número de espigas por metro linear, número de espiguetas, número de grãos por espigueta, número de grãos por espiga, massa de mil grãos, relação número de espiguetas e espigas, teor de nitrogênio nas folhas e produtividade de grãos. O teor de N foliar e os componentes do rendimento não foram alterados pela inoculação e coinoculação realizada tanto na semente quanto em pós-emergência das plântulas. Os tratamentos T3, T7 e T9 apresentaram as maiores médias de produtividade de grãos (2077,50; 1743,12 e 1660,62 kg ha-1, respectivamente), demonstrando que a coinoculação com A. brasilense Ab-V5 + Rhizobium sp. 53GRM1, bem como a inoculação com A. brasilense Ab-V5 + Ab-V6, ambos em pós-emergência das plântulas, apresentam potencial para substituir a adubação nitrogenada de cobertura na cultura do trigo.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38507/28493,E-ISSN 1679-0359

42,2021,"Bioavailability of soil Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn from soil fractions","Cationic micronutrients bioavailability depends on the chemical characteristics of soil fractions. Fourteen soils received individual doses of five micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, B) arranged in seven treatments set according a Baconian Matrix. The soils incubated with treatments during 15 days had corn cultivated in greenhouse for 30 days, in three consecutive growth cycles. The cationic micronutrients were determined in the corn shoots after each growth cycle. Soil samples collected before the first and after each growth cycle had the available concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn determined by single extractions (Mehlich-1 and DTPA-pH 7.3) and by sequential extraction. Correlation analysis was performed for the Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn concentrations determined in the corn shoots, the available concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the soils (Mehlich-1 and DTPA) and the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the soil fractions (sequential extraction). The distribution of available metals forms in fractions reflected their affinity with soil components. Soil available Cu correlated with Cu bound to organic matter. The exchangeable fraction was the main source of soil available Mn and Zn. The Fe availability related mainly to the Mn oxides, Fe oxides, and exchangeable fractions. The plants absorbed Cu mainly from the Mn-oxides and organic matter fractions. Manganese absorbed by plants originated from the exchangeable and Mn-oxides fractions. The Zn absorbed by plants originated mainly from the exchangeable fraction. Correlations of single metal extractions (Mehlich-1 and DTPA) with Cu, Mn and Zn contents in plants were positive.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37931/28563,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The production is relatively independent on climatic conditions, faster obtaining of the finished product and need small space. Biopolymers have been studied thoroughly in the last years. Due to wide diversity in structure and physical properties, the microbial polysaccharides possess a lot of applications in food, pharmaceutical, oil, cosmetics, textile, inks and agricultural products among others industries. Some of those applications, include uses as emulsifying, stabilizing, binding, jellifying, clotting, lubricants, film coated, thickening and suspender agents. The parameters that have most influenced the process of exopolysaccharides biosyntheses have been the microorganism, the culture medium composition, pH and temperature of incubation. The exopolysaccharide production can be developed by species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, some microalgae and many moulds. This work discusses the influence of these parameters during the production process and exopolysaccharides biosyntheses by bacteria.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2259/1939,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was randomized blocks in a 4 x 4 factorial scheme involving four plant populations (100, 200, 300 and 400 thousand plants ha-1) and four rates of fertilization and liming (0.0; 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 of the recommended doses) with four replicates. Plant height, grain yield, pod number per plant, grain number per pod and 100 grain-weight were determined. It follows that both, fertilization plus liming and high plant population resulted into higher yields.

Group II consisted of 31 dogs examined on the same University between 2000 and 2001. Dogs were serological evaluated for evidence of T. gondii or N. caninum. The serological results for T. gondii were 82,5% and 35.4% on groups I and II, respectively. Histologic lesions compatible with distemper on the two groups were observed. T. gondii cysts were observed in two dogs by histopathology and immunohistochemistry.

28,2007,Zinc sources applied in seeds of sorghum 310 cv. BR and the initial growth,"The zinc application in sorghum seeds can affect the nutrition and the initial growth of the plants. Thus, the objective of their study was to evaluate the zinc application in the form of sulphate and oxide on the nutrition and on the initial growth of the plant of sorghum cv. BRS 310. The treatments had been five rates 0; 14,3; 28,6; 57,2 and 114,4 g Zn kg-1 of seeds and two zinc sources, the sulphate (22% of Zn) and the oxide (50% of Zn). The experimental units were translucent polyethylene trays a filled with 5 L of washed thick sand, with 50 seeds of sorghum cv. BRS 310. The plants were cut 25 days after the sowing, and were evaluated for dry matter of above ground parts and the roots and it was determined the content and the accumulation of Zn in the plants. The zinc application in the oxide form promoted greater increment of dry matter in sorghum plants and provided to greater efficiency of use of the micronutrient, even so, with lesser efficiency of absorption, when compared the source sulphate. The source sulphate caused reduction in the production of the mass of the dry matter of sorghum. The sources had promoted alteration in the absorption of other nutrients for the sorghum plants, being that the source sulphate developed the absorption of P, Ca, S and Mn and the source oxide bigger absorption of K, Mg, Cu and Fe.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2958/2505,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Although the data analysis showed the occurrence of complications and death in patients initially thought to be risk free and in patients where safe anesthetic agents were used, no statistical correlation was determined to exist between morbidity or mortality and either the ASA classification of the animals or the anesthetic agent.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2362/2019,E-ISSN 1679-0359

27,2006,Amylase and protease inhibition activity against Fusarium verticillioides Amylase and protease inhibition activity against Fusarium verticillioides,"The primary maize pathogen, Fusarium verticillioides (F. moniliforme Sheldon) is responsible for fumonisin production, which is harmful to human and animal health. In addition, maize can be more susceptible to fungal infection after insect attack. The activity of amylase and protease inhibitors in AG 5011 and CD 307 hybrids were determined during germination with controlled and not controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity and, they were correlated to maize resistance against Sithophilus zeamais. The inhibitory activity during corn germination was evaluated at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 h. Amylase and protease inhibitory activity increased during germination in both hybrids, which ranged respectively from 2.8 to 39.5 UIA/g, and 550.0 to 3633.9 UIP/g. The highest levels of inhibitory activity occurred in hybrid CD 307 in germination chamber. The biologic cycle and susceptible rate were evaluated for corn resistance test. The AG 5011 hybrid was less susceptible to S. zeamais and showed higher inhibitory activity (time 0 h), demonstrating possible relationship between resistance against the insect and inhibitory enzymes. These results indicated that maize natural defense mechanism plays an important role on phytopathogen control.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/2425/2072,E-ISSN 1679-0359
